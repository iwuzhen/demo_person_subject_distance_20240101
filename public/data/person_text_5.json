For portraying Escalante, Edward James Olmos was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 61st Academy Awards.[3] The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature in 1988. The film's title refers to the 1987 Mr. Mister song of the same name, which is also featured in the film's ending credits./nIn 2011, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"./nIn the early 1980s, Jaime Escalante becomes a mathematics teacher at James A. Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. The school is full of Latino students from working-class families whose academic achievement is far below their grade level. Two students, Angel and another gangster, arrive late and question Escalante's authority. Escalante demonstrates how to multiply numbers using one's fingers and appeals to the students' sense of humor. After class, some gangsters threaten Escalante. After school, he stops the gangsters from fighting. He then introduces himself as a \"one-man gang\" with the classroom as his domain. Escalante tells the students that he has decided to teach the students algebra./nAt a meeting, Escalante learns that the school's accreditation is under threat, as test scores are not high enough. Escalante says that students will rise to the level that is expected of them. Escalante gives the students a quiz every morning and a new student joins the class. He instructs his class under the philosophy of ganas, roughly translating to \"desire\"./nEscalante tells other faculty that he wants to teach the students calculus. He seeks to change the school culture to help the students excel in academics, as he has seen the untapped potential of his class. Other teachers ridicule him, as the students have not taken the prerequisites. Escalante states that the students can take the prerequisites over the summer. He sets a goal of having the students take Advanced Placement Calculus by their senior year./nThe students sign up for the prerequisites over the summer. There is no air conditioning, but Escalante is able to teach the class, giving them oranges and telling them to focus so they can get good jobs and take vacations. In the fall, he gives the students contracts to be signed by the parents; they must come in on Saturdays, show up an hour early to school, and stay until 5pm in order to prepare for the AP Calculus exam./nTwo weeks before the students' calculus exam, Escalante is teaching an ESL class to some adults. He suddenly clutches at his torso in pain, stumbles into the hallway, and falls. A substitute teacher is found for the students while Escalante recovers in the hospital, but the substitute teacher is a music teacher. Soon after, Escalante escapes from the hospital and shows up at school to continue teaching. After taking the AP calculus exam, the students head to the beach and celebrate. All 18 students who took the exam pass it. At a meeting to congratulate the students, a plaque of appreciation is presented to Escalante./nTo the dismay of both Escalante and the students, the Educational Testing Service questions the students' exam scores.

Escalante meets with the investigators from Educational Testing Service, argues with them, but ultimately offers to have the students retake the test.

Also, he suffered inflammation of the gall bladder, not a heart attack.[7]/nTen of the 1982 students signed waivers to allow the College Board to show their exams to Jay Mathews, the author of Escalante: The Best Teacher in America. Mathews found that nine of them had made \"identical silly mistakes\" on free response question six. Mathews heard from two of the students that during the exam, a piece of paper had been passed around with that flawed solution.[6] Twelve students, including the nine with the identical mistakes, retook the exam, and most of them received the top scores of four and five.

Most, if not all, of this information has turned out to be false and Chalabi has been called a fabricator.[11][12] Along with this, Chalabi also subsequently boasted, in an interview with the British Sunday Telegraph, about the impact that their alleged falsifications had on American policy.[13] These factors led to a falling out between him and the U.S. government.[12] Furthermore, Chalabi was found guilty in the Petra Bank scandal in Jordan./nIn January 2012, a French intelligence official stated that he believed Chalabi to be \"acting on behalf of Iran\".[14]/nChalabi was the son of a prominent Shia family,[15] one of the wealthy power elite of Baghdad. He was born in Kadhimiya in 1945. His family, who dated back 300 years to the Sultanate, ran Iraq's oldest commercial bank under the British-backed Kingdom of Iraq.[16] His father, Abdel Hadi Chalabi, a wealthy grain merchant and member of the Iraqi parliament, became head of the senate when King Abdullah I of Jordan was assassinated./nHis family retired from public life to a farmhouse near Baghdad when the military seized power. Chalabi left Iraq with his family in 1958, following the 14 July Revolution,[16][17] and spent most of his life in the United States and the United Kingdom.[18] He was educated at Baghdad College and Seaford College in Sussex, England before leaving for America./nIn exile, following the Ba'ath party takeover, his family acted as the Iraqi Shia clergy's bankers.[16] In the mid-1960s, he studied with cryptographer Whitfield Diffie at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics.[19] In 1969, he earned a PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago under the direction of George Glauberman on the Theory of Knots.[20] after which he took a position in the mathematics department at the American University of Beirut. He published three mathematics papers between 1973 and 1980, in the field of abstract algebra./nIn 1971, Chalabi married Leila Osseiran, daughter of Lebanese politician Adel Osseiran. They had four children, Tamara, Mariam, Hashem and Hadi.[21] Whilst still at Beirut the civil war broke out in 1975, so he moved to Jordan and found work as an interpreter./nChalabi was a bold and shrewd investor, amassing a fortune of $100 million[citation needed]. During his life he was accused of corruption many times. In 1977, he founded the Petra Bank in Jordan with Crown Prince Hassan, the King's brother.[18] In May 1989, the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan, Mohammed Said Nabulsi, issued a decree ordering all banks in the country to deposit 35% of their reserves with the Central Bank.[22] Petra Bank was the only bank that was unable to meet this requirement. An investigation was launched which led to accusations of embezzlement and false accounting. The bank failed, causing a $350 million bail-out by the Central Bank.[23] Chalabi fled the country, in the trunk of a Jordanian prince's car,[16] before the authorities could react. Chalabi was convicted and sentenced in absentia for bank fraud by a Jordanian military tribunal to 22 years in prison. Chalabi maintained that his prosecution was a politically motivated effort to discredit him sponsored by Saddam Hussein.[18] It was widely reported that Chalabi escaped Jordan locked in the trunk of a car owned by Prince Hassan of Jordan.[24]/nLiving abroad by 1992 in London, and unable to return home for fear of his life, he set up the Iraqi National Congress with an agenda of regime change for his homeland. The organization was open to all ethnic and religious groups of Iraq, including Arabs, Kurds, Turkmen, Sunni and Shia Muslims. Already a fluent English speaker, he turned his attention to Washington DC.[citation needed]/nIn 1995 after preparation and lobbying he persuaded President Bill Clinton to fund an expedition into northern Iraq to use subterfuge to start an insurgency. Chalabi was convinced that the Iraqi military would rise up to overthrow the dictator. The commanders to whom he had spoken, were the same who openly supported Saddam and crushed his opponents in the Kurdish and Shia revolts. The insurgency failed, lacking the promised ground troops, and 100 insurgents were killed by the military. The command structure of INC fell apart with factional infighting. Chalabi was banned from those frequent visits to CIA headquarters at Langley, Virginia. Nonetheless, Chalabi was doggedly determined: in 1998 Congress passed the Iraq Liberation Act passing into American law the objective of \"regime change\" in Iraq.[citation needed]/nIt was reported by BBC News in May 2005 that the Jordanian government was considering whether to pardon Chalabi, in part to ease the relations between Jordan and the new Iraqi government of which Chalabi was a member.[25] According to one report, Chalabi proposed a $32 million compensation fund for depositors affected by Petra Bank's failure. The website for Petra Bank contains a press release stating that Chalabi would refuse the pardon.[26] Although Chalabi always maintained the case was a plot to frame him by Baghdad, the issue was revisited when the U.S. State Department raised questions about the accounting practices of the Iraqi National Congress (INC).[18] According to The New York Times, \"Chalabi insisted on a public apology, which the Jordanians refused to give.\"[21]/nConservative pundit Arnaud de Borchgrave stated that following his escape from Jordan as a wanted fugitive, Chalabi established the Iraqi National Congress by sending out \"scores of all-expenses-paid invitations to Iraqi exiles to a conference in Vienna a month later. The conference created INC - and made Mr Chalabi its president\".[27] Around the same time, the Jordan's Central Bank Governor, Mohammed Said Nabulsi, had referred to Chalabi as \"one of the most notorious crooks in the history of the Middle East\".[28] Chalabi headed the executive council of the INC, an umbrella Iraqi opposition group created in 1992 for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.[17] The INC received major funding and assistance from the United States.[23] Chalabi was involved in organizing a resistance movement among Kurds in northern Iraq in the early mid-1990s.[18][23] When that effort was crushed and hundreds of his supporters were killed, Chalabi fled the country.[18] Chalabi lobbied in Washington for the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act (passed October 1998). This earmarked US$97 million to support Iraqi opposition groups.[18] Chalabi and the INC were widely reported to be active CIA assets in the pre-2003 period, with one report in the British Guardian newspaper estimating that CIA operatives had funnelled an estimated $100m to the INC, which had helped to finance the epic failure of the 1996 coup attempt by Kurdish forces.[29] In 2001 it was revealed that INC was accused of false accounting and irregularities. During the period from March 2000 to September 2003, the U.S. State Department paid nearly $33 million to the INC, according to a General Accounting Office report released in 2004, some of which was used to purchase office artefacts.[30]/nBefore the Iraq War (2003), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some members of the U.S. government, including some prominent neoconservatives within the Pentagon. Chalabi was said to have had political contacts within the Project for the New American Century, most notably with Paul Wolfowitz, a student of nuclear strategist Albert Wohlstetter, and Richard Perle. He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and political pundits in the United States, most notably Jim Hoagland of The Washington Post, who held him up as a notable force for democracy in Iraq.[31] He was a special guest of First Lady Laura Bush at the 2004 State of the Union Address.[32] Chalabi was flown back to Iraq after the invasion with a force of 700 US-trained militia and was, according to the Washington Times, being paid over $300,000 a month by the US government, with the direct support of Vice President Dick Cheney, Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Douglas Feith.[27]/nThe CIA was largely skeptical of Chalabi and the INC, but information allegedly from his group (most famously from a defector codenamed \"Curveball\") made its way into intelligence dossiers used by President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair to justify an invasion of Iraq. \"Curveball\", Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, fed officials hundreds of pages of bogus \"firsthand\" descriptions of mobile biological weapons factories on wheels and rails.[33] Secretary of State Colin Powell later used this information in a U.N. presentation trying to garner support for the war, despite warnings from German intelligence that \"Curveball\" was fabricating claims.[33] Since then, the CIA has admitted that the defector made up the story, and Powell said in 2011 the information should not have been used in his presentation.[33] A later congressionally appointed investigation (Robb-Silberman) concluded that Curveball had no relation whatsoever to the INC, and that press reports linking Curveball to the INC were erroneous.[34]/nThe INC often worked with the media, most notably with Judith Miller, concerning her WMD stories for The New York Times starting on 26 February 1998.[35] After the war, given the lack of discovery of WMDs, most of the WMD claims of the INC were shown to have been either misleading, exaggerated, or completely made up while INC information about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein's loyalists and Chalabi's personal enemies were accurate.[citation needed] Another of Chalabi's advocates was American Enterprise Institute's Iraq specialist Danielle Pletka. Chalabi received advice on media and television presentation techniques from the Irish scriptwriter and commentator Eoghan Harris prior to the invasion of Iraq.[36][citation needed]/nDuring the initial ten days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, American intelligence discovered signs that  Ahmed Chalabi was communicating with the Iranians and sharing details about US troop movements with their government. While this act of betrayal angered the Americans, it was largely downplayed at the time. The U.S. aimed to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond Iraq's borders, so it was seen as beneficial that the Iranians were aware that U.S. troops had no intention of entering Iran. When questioned later about his dealings with the Iranian government during that period, Chalabi provided an ambiguous response: \"I did not pass any information to Iran that compromised any national security information of the United States.\"[37]/nIn April as U.S. forces took control during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, Chalabi entered with allied troops the southern town of Shatrah. 300 US-trained FIF (Freedom for Iraq Fighters) expected opposition, but none emerged. Thousands of Iraqis cheered the troops.[citation needed] Chalabi returned under their aegis and was given a position on the Iraq interim governing council by the Coalition Provisional Authority. He served as president of the council in September 2003. He denounced a plan to let the UN choose an interim government for Iraq. \"We are grateful to President Bush for liberating Iraq, but it is time for the Iraqi people to run their affairs,\" he was quoted as saying in The New York Times.[38]/nIn August 2003, Chalabi was the only candidate whose unfavorable ratings exceeded his favorable ones with Iraqis in a State Department poll.[39] In a survey of nearly 3,000 Iraqis in February 2004 (by Oxford Research International, sponsored by the BBC in the United Kingdom, ABC in the U.S., ARD of Germany, and the NHK in Japan), only 0.2 percent of respondents said he was the most trustworthy leader in Iraq (see survey link below, question #13). A secret document written in 2002 by the British Overseas and Defence Secretariat reportedly described Chalabi as \"a convicted fraudster popular on Capitol Hill.\"[40]/nIn response to the WMD controversy, Chalabi told London's The Daily Telegraph in February 2004,/nWe are heroes in error. As far as we're concerned, we've been entirely successful. That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad. What was said before is not important. The Bush administration is looking for a scapegoat.[13]/nAs Chalabi's position of trust with the Pentagon crumbled, he found a new political position as a champion of Iraq's Shia (Chalabi himself was Shia). Beginning 25 January 2004, Chalabi and his close associates promoted the claim that leaders around the world were illegally profiting from the Oil for Food program. These charges were around the same time that UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi indicated that Chalabi would likely not be welcome in a future Iraqi government. Up until this time, Chalabi had been mentioned formally several times in connection with possible future leadership positions. Chalabi contended that documents in his possession detailed the misconduct, but he did not provide any documents or other evidence. The U.S. sharply criticized Chalabi's Oil for Food investigation as undermining the credibility of its own./nAdditionally, Chalabi and other members of the INC were investigated for fraud involving the exchange of Iraqi currency, grand theft of both national and private assets, and many other criminal charges in Iraq. On 19 May 2004 the U.S. government discontinued their regular payments to Chalabi for information he provided. Iraqi police, supported by U.S. soldiers, raided his offices and residence on 20 May, taking documents and computers, presumably to be used as evidence.[41] A major target of the raid was Aras Habib, Chalabi's long-term director of intelligence, who controlled the vast network of agents bankrolled by U.S. funding. The U.S. announced that they had stopped funding the INC, having previously paid the organization $330,000 per month.[41]/nIn June 2004, it was reported that Chalabi gave U.S. state secrets to Iran in April, including the fact that one of the United States' most valuable sources of Iranian intelligence was a broken Iranian code used by their spy services.[42] Chalabi allegedly learned of the code through a drunk American involved in the code-breaking operation.[42] Chalabi denied all of the charges, which nothing ever came of./nAn arrest warrant for alleged counterfeiting was issued for Chalabi on 8 August 2004, while at the same time a warrant was issued on murder charges against his nephew Salem Chalabi (at the time, head of the Iraqi Special Tribunal), while they both were out of the country.[43] Chalabi returned to Iraq on 10 August planning to make himself available to Iraqi government officials, but he was never arrested. Charges were later dropped against Chalabi, with Judge Zuhair al-Maliki citing lack of evidence.[43]/nOn 1 September 2004, Chalabi told reporters of an assassination attempt made on him near Latifiya, a town south of Baghdad. Chalabi reported he was returning from a meeting with Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani (whose trust Chalabi enjoyed)[16] in Najaf, where a few days earlier a cease-fire had taken effect, ending three weeks of confrontations between followers of Muqtada al-Sadr and the U.S. military, at the time.[citation needed]/nHe regained enough credibility to be made deputy prime minister on 28 April 2005.[43] At the same time he was made acting oil minister,[43][44] before the appointment of Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum in May 2005. On protesting IMF austerity measures, Al-Uloum was instructed to extend his vacation by a month in December 2005 by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Chalabi was reappointed as acting oil minister. Al-Uloum returned to the post in January 2006.[45]/nIn November 2005, Chalabi traveled to the U.S. and met with top U.S. government officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley.[46] At this time Chalabi also traveled to Iran to meet with Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad./nThe Iraqi National Congress, headed by Chalabi, was a part of the United Iraqi Alliance in the 2005 legislative election. After the election, Chalabi claimed that he had the support of the majority of elected members of United Iraqi Alliance and staked claim to be the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq; however, Ibrahim al-Jaafari later emerged as the consensus candidate for prime minister.[47]/nPrior to the December 2005 elections, the Iraqi National Congress had left the United Iraqi Alliance and formed the National Congress Coalition, which ran in the elections but failed to win a single seat in Parliament, gaining less than 0.5% of the vote.[48] Other groups joining the INC in this list included: Democratic Iraqi Grouping, Democratic Joint Action Front, First Democratic National Party, Independent List, Iraqi Constitutional Movement, Iraqi Constitutional Party, Tariq Abd al-Karim Al Shahd al-Budairi, and the Turkoman Decision Party. He was refused a seat in the cabinet.  Dogged by allegations, still unproven, of corruption he retorted that he had never \"participated in any scheme of intelligence against the United States.\"[49]/nChalabi attended the 2006 Bilderberg Conference meeting outside of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In October 2007, Chalabi was appointed by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki to head the Iraqi services committee, a consortium of eight service ministries and two Baghdad municipal posts tasked with the \"surge\" plan's next phase, restoring electricity, health, education and local security services to Baghdad neighborhoods.[50] \"The key is going to be getting the concerned local citizens\u2014and all the citizens\u2014feeling that this government is reconnected with them.... [Chalabi] agrees with that,\" said Gen. David Petraeus. Chalabi \"is an important part of the process,\" said Col. Steven Boylan, Petraeus' spokesman. \"He has a lot of energy.\"[50] In April 2008, journalist Melik Kaylan wrote about Chalabi, \"Arguably, he has, more than anyone in the country, evolved a detailed sense of what ails Baghdadis and how to fix things.\"[51]/nAfter the invasion Chalabi was placed in charge of \"de-Ba'athification\"\u2014the removal of senior office holders judged to have been close supporters of the deposed Saddam Hussein. The role fell into disuse, but in early 2010 Chalabi was accused of reviving this dormant post to eliminate his political enemies, especially Sunnis. The banning of some 500 candidates prior to the general election of 7 March 2010 at the initiative of Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress was reported to have badly damaged previously improving relations between the Shia and Sunni.[52]/nOur national and political arena has lost a prominent figure who dedicated his life to serve the country/nSheikh Humam Hamoudi, Statement on 3 November 2015[15][53]/nOn 26 January 2012, The New York Times reported Western intelligence officials expressing concern that Chalabi was working with the leading opposition group in Bahrain, Al Wefaq National Islamic Society. A French intelligence official said, \"When we hear that some members of the opposition are in touch with Hezbollah or with shady figures like the Iraqi Ahmed Chalabi, of whom we think he is acting on behalf of Iran, then this worries us\". The connection between Chalabi and Al Wefaq was acknowledged by Jawad Fairooz, secretary general of Wefaq and a former member of Parliament in Bahrain. Fairooz said, \"Mr Chalabi has helped us with contacts in Washington like other people have done and we thank them.\"[54]/nDuring an interview in 2014, he was shown to be frail and depressed about his country's future:/nIraq is a mess. Daesh is organised, with one command, united and well run, and we are so fragmented. We have no discipline, no command structure, no effective plans.[49]/nThe period leading up to Chalabi's death was marked by regular pronouncements released by Chalabi in various formats in which he would expose alleged corruption of highest officials in the Paul Bremer-led Provisional Coalition Authority and in the Iraqi Government led by Nouri Al Maliki.[55] Chalabi died on 3 November 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, having apparently suffered a heart attack at his home in Kadhimiya, Baghdad.[15][56] Iraqi Press speculated at the time of his death that it came about as a result of being poisoned due to his ongoing efforts to expose regime corruption.[57] He died while serving as member of the Iraqi Parliament and chaired its Finance Committee.[58] Ahmed Chalabi was laid to rest at the Kadhimiya Holy Shrine, a high honour bestowed by Iraq's influential Shia theocratic establishment.[55]", "34945448": "John Robert Ringrose (born 21 December  1932) is an English mathematician working on operator algebras who introduced nest algebras.

Wagner received his Ph.D. in 1937, with a dissertation concerning the Jordan curve theorem and four color theorem, and taught at Cologne for many years himself.[1] In 1970, he moved to the University of Duisburg, where he remained until his retirement in 1978./nWagner is known for his contributions to graph theory and particularly the theory of graph minors, graphs that can be formed from a larger graph by contracting and removing edges./nWagner's theorem characterizes the planar graphs as exactly those graphs that do not have as a minor either a complete graph K5 on five vertices or a complete bipartite graph K3,3 with three vertices on each side of its bipartition. That is, these two graphs are the only minor-minimal non-planar graphs. It is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, Kuratowski's theorem, which states that the planar graphs are exactly those graphs that do not contain as a subgraph a subdivision of K5 or K3,3./nAnother result of his, also known as Wagner's theorem, is that a four-connected graph is planar if and only if it has no K5 minor. This implies a characterization of the graphs with no K5 minor as being constructed from planar graphs and Wagner graph (an eight-vertex M\u00f6bius ladder) by clique-sums, operations that glue together subgraphs at cliques of up to three vertices and then possibly remove edges from those cliques. This characterization was used by Wagner to show that the case k = 5 of the Hadwiger conjecture on the chromatic number of Kk-minor-free graphs is equivalent to the four color theorem. Analogous characterizations of other families of graphs in terms of the summands of their clique-sum decompositions have since become standard in graph minor theory./nWagner conjectured in the 1930s (although this conjecture was not published until later)[2] that in any infinite set of graphs, one graph is isomorphic to a minor of another. The truth of this conjecture implies that any family of graphs closed under the operation of taking minors (as planar graphs are) can automatically be characterized by finitely many forbidden minors analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs. Neil Robertson and Paul Seymour finally published a proof of Wagner's conjecture in 2004 and it is now known as the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem.[3]/nWagner was honored in 1990 by a festschrift on graph theory,[4] and in June 2000, following Wagner's death, the University of Cologne hosted a Festkolloquium in his memory.[5]", "1587628": "Neal I.

Sammet (March 23, 1928 \u2013 May 20, 2017) was an American computer scientist who developed the FORMAC programming language in 1962. She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language./nShe received her B.A. in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A. in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949.  She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978.[4]/nSammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group.  From 1958 to 1961, she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group. She joined IBM in 1961  where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs.  She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979.[citation needed]/nSammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN). She was the first female president of the ACM, from 1974 to 1976.[5]/nJean E. Sammet was born on March 23, 1928, in New York City. Jean and her sister, Helen, were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School.[1]/nSammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois, where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951.[1] When Sammet first encountered a computer, in 1949 at the University of Illinois, she was not impressed, considering it an obscene piece of hardware.[6]/nIn 1951, Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment.[1]/nIn 1951, Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her.[1]/nFrom 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy\u2019s submarine program during her time there. In early January 1955, Sammet began her life as a programmer. Sperry Gyroscope was working on a digital computer, the Sperry Electronic Digital Automatic Computer (SPEEDAC) and asked Sammet to be their programmer. Her first task was to write the basic loader for the SPEEDAC, which was a 20-line program that took three days to toggle into the computer by hand in binary.[1]/nSammet became the group leader of what was called an \u201copen shop\u201d as Sperry began hiring more programmers. The \u201copen shop\u201d consisted of programmers acting as consultants to the engineers and involved scientists who assisted them in writing and testing their routines. The group produced other system software and focused on scientific and engineering computations. In 1955 Sperry Gyroscope and Remington Rand merged and became Sperry Rand. This brought Sammet into contact with the UNIVAC I computer and Grace Hopper.[1]/nIn fall of 1956, Sammet taught one of the earliest graduate-level courses in computer programming in the Applied Mathematics department of Adelphi College (now University) on Long Island. Despite the fact that Adelphi did not have a computer and few textbooks on programming existed at the time, Sammet was able to instruct two courses for two years.[1]/nSammet decided to leave Sperry to work for a company with computers as its focal point. The classified job advertisements at the time were separated by gender and Sammet was unable to find a position for a woman in any field she was interested in so she decided to scan the men\u2019s list and found an engineer position at Sylvania Electric Products in Needham, Massachusetts.[7] Sammet was instead hired to oversee software development for the MOBIDIC project by Carl Hammer, the person responsible for Sylvania\u2019s software development.[1]/nIn 1959, Sammet and five other programmers established much of the design of the influential COBOL programming language, in a proposal written in a span of two weeks that was eventually accepted by Sylvania's U.S. government clients.[3]/nSammet published Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals in 1969. The book gives an overview of 120 programming languages being used in the United States as of the late 1960s.[1]/nAround 1965 or 1966, Sammet noticed a need for the exchange of intellectual information with others working with languages and software while she worked on FORMAC.[8] She was a member of ACM for a number of years but was not active until she became interested in starting a special interest group that would allow her to speak with other professionals in the field. After a couple of failed attempts at contacting the person in charge of Special Interest Groups and Special Interest Committees at ACM, Sammet contacted George Forsythe, president of ACM from 1964 to 1966, who named her Chairperson of the Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation.[9]/nIn order to gain interest in SICSAM, Sammet wrote letters to people she identified through publications and what was happening in the field at that time. She identified people at Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, and IBM who were in different divisions and groups. Sammet faced resistance from the interest group on numerical analysis in ACM. Roughly five years after SICSAM formed, there was a conference about mathematical software called SIGNUM. Sammet states that she fought her way to give a paper at SIGNUM because the group was not interested in non-numerical analysis of that kind of an activity. With assistance from those interested in SICSAM, Sammet organized a conference held in March 1966, which was the Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SYMSAM).[9]/nIn June 1966, Tony Oettinger was elected president of ACM and Sammet was elected the Northeast Regional Representative (1966-1968). She was also a member of the ACM Council and ACM lecturer (1967, 1968, and 1972). Bernie Galler was elected president of ACM in 1968 and in August 1968, Sammet became chairperson of the ACM Committee on SIGs and SICs.[10][9]/nIn 1971 she was elected chair of SIGPLAN. She served one year of a two-year term before resigning because she was elected vice president of ACM in 1972. As chairperson of SIGPLAN, she organized conferences between SIGPLAN and various Special Interest Groups. Sammet has stated that these conferences were organized based on the recognition of how fundamental programming languages were to different aspects within computing.[9]/nSammet served as vice president of ACM from June 1972 to June 1974. Working with the president of ACM at the time, Tony Ralston, Sammet made the finances of ACM a priority. At the time of her vice presidency, ACM was almost bankrupt. Sammet convinced Ralston to hold a member-office forum prior to their annual conference. Sammet encouraged this based on her recognition that ACM had no realistic way of communicating with the membership.[9]/nSammet died on May 20, 2017, in Silver Spring, Maryland, after a brief illness.[3]", "54344146": "Gail Susan Kohl Wolkowicz is a Canadian researcher in differential equations, dynamical systems, and mathematical biology who works as a professor of mathematics and statistics at McMaster University.[1] She is known, among other contributions, for her proof that the competitive exclusion principle holds for inter-species competition in the chemostat.[2]/nAfter earning bachelor's and master's degrees at McGill University,[2] Wolkowicz completed her doctorate in 1984 at the University of Alberta,[2][3] under the supervision of Geoffrey J.

During his years at Kharagpur, he began to work on educational projects such as the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) to reform the education sector in Bengal. This interest in revolutionizing education eventually led to the inception of Vidyasagar University,[5] which he founded with the vision of having a non-traditional teaching and learning environment at the University level.[6] The University was finally established by the University Grants Commission (India) under the Vidyasagar University Act of 1981.[7]/nDue to his efforts to revolutionise education in Bengal, he became a key figure in the latter half of the Bengali Renaissance, as well as a renowned scholar and academic.

He is known for his role in developing Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axiomatic set theory and his proof of the well-ordering theorem. Furthermore, his 1929[1] work on ranking chess players is the first description of a model for pairwise comparison that continues to have a profound impact on various applied fields utilizing this method./nErnst Zermelo graduated from Berlin's Luisenst\u00e4dtisches Gymnasium (now Heinrich-Schliemann-Oberschule\u00a0[de]) in 1889. He then studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the University of Berlin, the University of Halle, and the University of Freiburg. He finished his doctorate in 1894 at the University of Berlin, awarded for a dissertation on the calculus of variations (Untersuchungen zur Variationsrechnung). Zermelo remained at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed assistant to Planck, under whose guidance he began to study hydrodynamics. In 1897, Zermelo went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, at that time the leading centre for mathematical research in the world, where he completed his habilitation thesis in 1899./nIn 1910, Zermelo left G\u00f6ttingen upon being appointed to the chair of mathematics at Zurich University, which he resigned in 1916.\nHe was appointed to an honorary chair at the University of Freiburg in 1926, which he resigned in 1935 because he disapproved of Adolf Hitler's regime.[2] At the end of World War II and at his request, Zermelo was reinstated to his honorary position in Freiburg./nIn 1900, in the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert challenged the mathematical community with his famous Hilbert's problems, a list of 23 unsolved fundamental questions which mathematicians should attack during the coming century. The first of these, a problem of set theory, was the continuum hypothesis introduced by Cantor in 1878, and in the course of its statement Hilbert mentioned also the need to prove the well-ordering theorem./nZermelo began to work on the problems of set theory under Hilbert's influence and in 1902 published his first work concerning the addition of transfinite cardinals. By that time he had also discovered the so-called Russell paradox. In 1904, he succeeded in taking the first step suggested by Hilbert towards the continuum hypothesis when he proved the well-ordering theorem (every set can be well ordered). This result brought fame to Zermelo, who was appointed Professor in G\u00f6ttingen, in 1905. His proof of the well-ordering theorem, based on the powerset axiom and the axiom of choice, was not accepted by all mathematicians, mostly because the axiom of choice was a paradigm of non-constructive mathematics. In 1908, Zermelo succeeded in producing an improved proof making use of Dedekind's notion of the \"chain\" of a set, which became more widely accepted; this was mainly because that same year he also offered an axiomatization of set theory./nZermelo began to axiomatize set theory in 1905; in 1908, he published his results despite his failure to prove the consistency of his axiomatic system. See the article on Zermelo set theory for an outline of this paper, together with the original axioms, with the original numbering./nIn 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently improved Zermelo's axiom system. The resulting 8 axiom system, now called Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms (ZF), is now the most commonly used system for axiomatic set theory./nProposed in 1931, the Zermelo's navigation problem is a classic optimal control problem. The problem deals with a boat navigating on a body of water, originating from a point O to a destination point D. The boat is capable of a certain maximum speed, and we want to derive the best possible control to reach D in the least possible time./nWithout considering external forces such as current and wind, the optimal control is for the boat to always head towards D. Its path then is a line segment from O to D, which is trivially optimal. With consideration of current and wind, if the combined force applied to the boat is non-zero, the control for no current and wind does not yield the optimal path./nWorks by others:", "46512614": "Alvany Rocha-Caridi is a mathematician at the City University of New York who specializes in the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, and who is particularly known for her computation of the characters of the Virasoro algebra.[1]/nRocha earned her Ph.D. in 1978 from Rutgers University under the supervision of Nolan Wallach.[2]/nAfter postdoctoral studies at the University of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Rutgers,[3] she worked at CUNY's Baruch College and then, in 1990, also joined the faculty of the CUNY Graduate Center, where she has been executive officer for the mathematics program.[1]/nIn 2012, she was named as one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.[1][4]", "41171431": "Eric Mark Friedlander (born January 7, 1944 in Santurce, Puerto Rico)[1]  is an American mathematician who is working in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory and representation theory./nFriedlander graduated from Swarthmore College with bachelor's degree in 1965 and in 1970 received a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the supervision of Michael Artin, (Fibrations in \u00c9tale Homotopy Theory).[2] He was a postdoctoral instructor at Princeton University: a lecturer in 1971 and assistant professor in 1972.

He printed John Arrowsmith's sermon to the houses of parliament, England's Eben-ezer in 1645, and his Great Wonder in Heaven in 1647. In 1646 he published a pamphlet A Defence of Master Chaloner's Speech, and an early edition of The Marrow of Modern Divinity attributed to Edward Fisher: in 1648 appeared The Differences in Scotland stil on foot, and from 1648 an almanack or Moderate Intelligencer of military affairs entitled Mercurius Republicus. Robert Leybourn gave the apparently fraudulent ascription to Sir William Davenant of Edmund Bolton's historical poem London, King Charles his Augusta, or City Royal of 1648.[2] He printed Joseph Mede's sermon on St. Peter's prediction of the apocalypse, and a work called The Englishe Catholike Christian by one Thomas de la More, minister, followed in 1649.[3]/nInto his industrious hands William Leybourn introduced the second year of his astronomical almanac, Speculum Anni for 1649, and also the important astronomical work he had written with Vincent Wing, their Urania Practica, together with their reply to the criticisms of Julian Shakerley. From this time forth the Leybourn press found its direction in the works of William Leybourn, and of Vincent Wing, and for a wide range of serious works of astronomy, mathematics, surveying, military matters, and the like. In 1650 was printed Richard Elton's The Complete Body of the Art Military, John Wybard's Tactometria, seu Tetagmenomentria: or, the geometry of regulars practically proposed, John Chatfield's The Trigonall Sector: the description and use thereof and the two parts of Thomas Rudd's Practical Geometry, and also John Spencer's Catalogue of the Library of Sion House, as well as Leybourn's own Planometria, or the Whole Art of Surveying Land under the pseudonym 'Oliver Wallinby'.[4]/nIn 1651 William Leybourn entered into a business partnership with Robert Leybourn as a printer and seller of books.[1] Their extensive catalogue thereafter became one of the most important of its time in the publishing or re-publishing of such materials. The second and third (posthumous) editions of Samuel Foster's The Art of Dialling (which first appeared in 1638), with additional materials, was an early success.[5] The press closed in 1666, following the Great Fire of London (in which almost the entire second edition of Wing's Geod\u00e6tes Practicus, 1666, was incinerated[6]), after which William moved to Northcott in Southall, Middlesex.[1]/nIn 1648, Leybourn wrote Urania Practica with Vincent Wing, the first substantial compendium of astronomy written in the English language.[1] This was printed by Robert Leybourn in London. Leybourn's press also printed other books of Wing's such as Geodaetes Practicus.[7]/nPlanometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a pamphlet written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby.[1] Leybourn expanded this into a full book, The Compleat Surveyor which was first published in 1653, by his own press.[8] This was the first book published on the subject that did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying.[9] It outlined the various instruments used in surveying, and how they were employed.[10] It remained one of the standard references in the field into the 18th century. It instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, and how to make the appropriate coloured inks for the maps.[11] At this time, the use of private estate maps was starting to become fashionable, providing clients with satisfying coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a unit of length shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn later expanded and clarified this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.[12]/nIn 1669 Leybourn authored The Art of Dialling, a book on the use of sun-dials and astrolabes in determining the position of vessels at sea. The contemporary expansion of the Royal Navy and Merchant Marines created a significant demand for such manuals, and The Art of Dialling was well written, easy to understand and cheaply produced.[10]/nLeybourn's 1693 work Panarithmologia, being a mirror for merchants, breviate for bankers, treasure for tradesmen, mate for mechanicks, and a sure guide for purchasers, sellers, or mortgagers of land, leases, annuities, rents, pensions, etc. ... and a constant concomitant fitted for all men's occasions. remained widely printed longer than any other of his works. Over twenty editions were printed, and printing remained active into the 19th century.[1]/nLeybourn acquired a good reputation as surveyor of land, and was often hired to survey the estates of gentlemen.[13] In 1672, six years after the Great Fire of London, John Ogilby hired Leybourn to lead a survey of London.[14][15] Leybourn identified the need for books that explained the techniques for measuring building materials that were widely accessible, both in cost and language. This was needed for both determining the extent of the damage from the Great Fire, and for calculating the cost of repairs.[16]/nIt was believed that Leybourn was the designer of the emblem of the Bridge House Estates Trust,[17] which was charged with maintaining the first stone bridge over the River Thames. The emblem, sometimes known as the \"Southwark Cross\" but correctly the \"Bridge House Mark\" may have been adopted by Leybourn from a mark used on surveying maps to denote properties of the Bridge House in the 1550s: an earlier version in the London Museum on a stone of the Bridge is dated 1509, and the modern version can be seen in use (before Leybourn's appointment) on the City sword-rest of 1674 now in Southwark Cathedral.[18][19] The trust retains that emblem to this day.[20]", "4340220": "James Macklin \"Mac\" Hyman (born 1950) is an applied mathematician formerly at Los Alamos National Laboratory and currently at Tulane University in the United States.

In that work he decries the breakdown of capitalism as a model during the bailouts characterizing the  2008 financial crisis and calls for a return to principles, to the notion that if you want to take a chance on the upside, you have also taken a chance on the downside./nMore generally, he analyzes three ways of understanding the behavior of the world: models, theory and intuition. Models, he argues, are merely metaphors that compare something you would like to understand with something you already do. Models provide relative knowledge. Theories, in contrast, are attempts to understand the world on absolute terms; while models stand on someone else's legs, theories, like Newton's or Maxwell's or Spinoza's, stand on their own. Intuition, the deepest kind of knowledge, comes only occasionally, after long and hard work, and is a merging of the understander with the understood. His book elaborates on these ideas with examples from the theories of physics and philosophy, and the models of finance./nIn 2016, Derman and Michael Miller published a textbook titled The Volatility Smile, a textbook about the principles of financial modeling, option valuation, and the variety of models that can account for the volatility smile.", "58505739": "Yilun Dianna Xu is a mathematician and computer scientist whose research concerns the computational geometry of curves and surfaces, computer vision, and computer graphics.

He was a professor at the Moscow State University and was known for his work in group theory, especially on the Burnside problem./nAdian was born near Elizavetpol. He grew up there in an Armenian family. He studied at Yerevan and Moscow pedagogical institutes. His advisor was Pyotr Novikov. He worked at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. Alexander Razborov was one of his students./nIn his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n of a real variable satisfying the functional equation \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)}\n\n and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician Edwin Hewitt from the University of Washington gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later.[citation needed]/nBy the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n, for any group \n\n\n\nG\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G}\n\n. These results constituted his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian's result was immediately used by Andrey Markov Jr. in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic./nAbout the Burnside problem:/nVery much like Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside\u2019s\nproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the mind of the mathematician./nBefore the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for \n\n\n\nn\n\u2208\n{\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n6\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n\\in \\{2,3,4,6\\}}\n\n and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n. The only question was\nto find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\nform \n\n\n\n\nX\n\nn\n\n\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X^{n}=1}\n\n./nAn approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\ncollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods \n\n\n\nn\n>\n4381\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>4381}\n\n, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well./nThe solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\nand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\nis one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\nused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\nby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\nthe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\nof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more \u2018penetrating\u2019\nthan Adian./nIn contrast to the Adian\u2013Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way \u2018closed\u2019 the Burnside problem. Moreover,\nover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\nthe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\nfundamental problems in group theory./nBy the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\nappeared who mastered the Novikov\u2013Adian method, the theory already\nrepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\nperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.", "506420": "Solomon Kullback (April 3, 1907\u00a0\u2013 August 5, 1994) was an American cryptanalyst and mathematician, who was one of the first three employees hired by William F.

Friedman had begun an intensive program of training in cryptology for his new civilian employees. For several summers running, the SIS cryptanalysts attended training camps at Fort Meade until they received commissions as reserve officers in the Army. Kullback and Sinkov took Friedman's admonitions on education seriously and spent the next several years attending night classes; both received their doctorates in mathematics. Afterward, Kullback rediscovered a love of teaching; he began offering evening classes in mathematics at George Washington University from 1939./nOnce they had completed the training, the three were put to the work for which they had actually been hired, compilations of cipher or code material for the U.S. Army. Another task was to test commercial cipher devices which vendors wished to sell to the U.S. government./nKullback worked in partnership with Frank Rowlett against RED cipher machine messages. Almost overnight, they unravelled the keying system and then the machine pattern \u2013 with nothing but the intercepted messages in hand.

He also cooperated with the British in the solution of more conventional German codebook-based systems. Shortly after his return to the States, Kullback moved into the Japanese section as its chief./nWhen the National Security Agency (NSA) was formed in 1952, Rowlett became chief of cryptanalysis. The primary problem facing research and development in the post-war period was development of high-speed processing equipment. Kullback supervised a team of about 60 people, including such innovative thinkers in automated data processing development as Leo Rosen and Sam Snyder. His staff pioneered new forms of input and memory, such as magnetic tape and drum memory, and compilers to make machines truly \"multi-purpose\".

He contributed to the modern metric theory of dynamical systems and connected the world of deterministic (dynamical) systems with the world of probabilistic (stochastic) systems.[1]  He has also worked on mathematical physics and probability theory.[2]  His efforts have provided the groundwork for advances in the physical sciences.[1]/nSinai has won several awards, including the Nemmers Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics and the Abel Prize. He serves as the professor of mathematics at Princeton University since 1993 and holds the position of Senior Researcher at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics in Moscow, Russia./nYakov Grigorevich Sinai was born into a Russian Jewish academic family on September 21, 1935, in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia).[3] His parents, Nadezda Kagan and Gregory Sinai, were both microbiologists. His grandfather, Veniamin Kagan, headed the Department of\nDifferential Geometry at Moscow State University and was a major influence on Sinai's life.[3]/nSinai received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Moscow State University.[2]  In 1960, he earned his Ph.D., also from Moscow State; his adviser was Andrey Kolmogorov. Together with Kolmogorov, he showed that even for \"unpredictable\" dynamic systems, the level of unpredictability of motion can be described mathematically.  In their idea, which became known as Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai entropy, a system with zero entropy is entirely predictable, while a system with non-zero entropy has an unpredictability factor directly related to the amount of entropy.[1]/nIn 1963, Sinai introduced the idea of dynamical billiards, also known as \"Sinai Billiards\".  In this idealized system, a particle bounces around inside a square boundary without loss of energy.  Inside the square is a circular wall, of which the particle also bounces off.  He then proved that for most initial trajectories of the ball, this system is ergodic, that is, after a long time, the amount of that time the ball will have spent in any given region on the surface of the table is approximately proportional to the area of that region.  It was the first time anyone proved a dynamic system was ergodic.[1]/nAlso in 1963, Sinai announced a proof of the ergodic hypothesis for a gas consisting of n hard spheres confined to a box. The complete proof, however, was never published, and in 1987 Sinai declared that the announcement was premature. The problem remains open to this day.[4]/nOther contributions in mathematics and mathematical physics include the rigorous foundations of Kenneth Wilson's renormalization group-method, which led to Wilson's Nobel Prize for Physics in 1982, Gibbs measures in ergodic theory, hyperbolic Markov partitions, proof of the existence of Hamiltonian dynamics for infinite particle systems by the idea of \"cluster dynamics\", description of the discrete Schr\u00f6dinger operators by the localization of eigenfunctions, Markov partitions for billiards and Lorenz map (with Bunimovich and Chernov), a rigorous treatment of subdiffusions in dynamics, verification of asymptotic Poisson distribution of energy level gaps for a class of integrable dynamical systems, and his version of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations together with Khanin, Mattingly and Li./nFrom 1960 to 1971, Sinai was a researcher in the Laboratory of Probabilistic and Statistical Methods at Moscow State University.  In 1971 he accepted a position as senior researcher at the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics in Russia, while continuing to teach at Moscow State. He had to wait until 1981 to become a professor at Moscow State, likely because he had supported the dissident poet, mathematician and human rights activist Alexander Esenin-Volpin in 1968.[5]/nSince 1993, Sinai has been a professor of mathematics at Princeton University, while maintaining his position at the Landau Institute.  For the 1997\u201398 academic year, he was the Thomas Jones Professor at Princeton, and in 2005, the Moore Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology.[3]/nIn 2002, Sinai won the Nemmers Prize for his \"revolutionizing\" work on dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, probability theory, and statistical physics.[2]  In 2005, the Moscow Mathematical Journal dedicated an issue to Sinai writing \"Yakov Sinai is one of the greatest mathematicians of our time\u00a0... his exceptional scientific enthusiasm inspire[d] several generations of scientists all over the world.\"[3]/nIn 2013, Sinai received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement.[3] In 2014, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters awarded him the Abel Prize, for his contributions to dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and mathematical physics.[6]  Presenting the award, Jordan Ellenberg said Sinai had solved real world physical problems \"with the soul of a mathematician\".[1]  He praised the tools developed by Sinai which demonstrate how systems that look different may in fact have fundamental similarities.  The prize comes with 6 million Norwegian krone,[1] equivalent at the time to $US 1 million or \u00a3600,000. He was also inducted into the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.[7]/nOther awards won by Sinai include the Boltzmann Medal (1986), the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics (1990), the Dirac Prize (1992), the Wolf Prize in Mathematics (1997),  the Lagrange Prize (2008) and the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Prize (2009).[2][3] He is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[2]  He is an honorary member of the London Mathematical Society (1992) and, in 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[2][8]  Sinai has been selected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1983), Brazilian Academy of Sciences (2000), the Academia Europaea, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Royal Society of London.

He attended the Hogere Burgerschool nl (HBS) over there. It was in this school that he was first introduced to left-wing politics and socialism by one of his teachers, called Mister van Dam./nIn 1912 Struik entered the University of Leiden, where he showed great interest in mathematics and physics, influenced by the eminent professors Paul Ehrenfest and Hendrik Lorentz./nIn 1917 he worked as a high school mathematics teacher for a while, after which he worked as a research assistant for J.A. Schouten. It was during this period that he developed his doctoral dissertation, \"The Application of Tensor Methods to Riemannian Manifolds.\"/nIn 1922 Struik obtained his doctorate in mathematics from University of Leiden. He was appointed to a teaching position at University of Utrecht in 1923. The same year he married Saly Ruth Ramler,[4] a Czech mathematician with a doctorate from the Charles University of Prague./nIn 1924, funded by a Rockefeller fellowship, Struik traveled to Rome to collaborate with the Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita. It was in Rome that Struik first developed a keen interest in the history of mathematics. In 1925, thanks to an extension of his fellowship, Struik went to G\u00f6ttingen to work with Richard Courant compiling Felix Klein's lectures on the history of 19th-century mathematics. He also started researching Renaissance mathematics at this time. He also rekindled interest in a mistake that Aristotle made about tiling the universe with just the tetrahedron. It was first challenged in 1435.[5]/nIn 1926 Struik was offered positions both at the Moscow State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He decided to accept the latter, where he spent the rest of his academic career. He collaborated with Norbert Wiener on differential geometry, while continuing his research on the history of mathematics. He was made full professor at MIT in 1940./nStruik was a steadfast Marxist. Having joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands in 1919, he remained a Party member his entire life. When asked, upon the occasion of his 100th birthday, how he managed to pen peer-reviewed journal articles at such an advanced age, Struik replied blithely that he had the \"3Ms\" a man needs to sustain himself: Marriage (his wife, Saly Ruth Ramler, was not alive anymore though when he turned one hundred in 1994), Mathematics and Marxism./nDuring the mid-1950s McCarthy era, Struik's Marxist opinions led to accusations of him being a spy for the Soviet Union. He was also cited as an instance of \"subversive influence\" in a 1952 Senate committee publication.[6] He denied the allegations, and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee on July 24, 1951. Struik refused to answer any of the over 200 questions asked of him, repeatedly invoking the Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. (He had planned to invoke the First, but a recent US Supreme Court case had struck down that option.) On September 12, 1951, Struik was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury for \"conspiracy to overthrow the governments of the United States and Massachusetts, and for advocating the overflow of violence by the government of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\" and released on $10,000 bail. Soon thereafter, the MIT faculty voted to suspend Struik with full salary until the case was resolved.[7] The indictment would be quashed in 1956 by judge Paul G. Kirk after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in a different case that the federal Smith Act superseded Massachusetts' sedition laws.

He is known for Morera's theorem in the theory of functions of a complex variable and for his work in the theory of linear elasticity./nHe was born in Novara on 18 July 1856, the son of Giacomo Morera and Vittoria Unico.[2] According to Tricomi (1962), his family was a wealthy one, his father being a rich merchant. This occurrence eased him in his studies after the laurea:[3] however, he was an extraordinarily hard worker and he widely used this ability in his researches.[4] After studying in Turin he went to Pavia, Pisa and Leipzig: then he went back to Pavia for a brief period in 1885, and finally he went to Genova in 1886, living here for the next 15 years. While being in Genova he married his fellow-citizen Cesira Fa\u00e0.[5] From 1901 on to his death he worked in Turin:[6] he died of pneumonia on 8 February 1909.[7]/nHe earned in 1878 the laurea in engineering and then, in 1879, the laurea in mathematics, both awarded him from the Politecnico di Torino:[8] According to Somigliana (1910a, p.\u00a0605), the title of his thesis in the mathematical sciences was: \"Sul moto di un punto attratto da due centri fissi colla legge di Newton\".[9] In Turin he attended the courses held by Enrico d'Ovidio, Angelo Genocchi and particularly the ones held by Francesco Siacci: later in his life, Morera acknowledged Siacci as his mentor in scientific research and life.[10] After graduating, he followed several advanced courses: he studied in Pavia from 1881 to 1882[11] under Eugenio Beltrami, Eugenio Bertini[12] and Felice Casorati. In 1883 he was in Pisa under Enrico Betti, Riccardo de Paolis and Ulisse Dini: a year later, he was in Leipzig under Felix Klein, Adolph Mayer and Carl Neumann.[13] In 1885 he went in Berlin in order to follow the lessons of Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, Leopold Kronecker[14] and Karl Weierstrass at the local university: later in the same year, he went back to Italy, briefly working at the University of Pavia as a professor in the then newly established \"Scuola di Magistero\".[15] In 1886, after passing the required competitive examination by a judging commission,[16] he became professor of rational mechanics at the University of Genova: he lived there for 15 years, serving also as dean and as rector.[17] In 1901 he was called by the University of Turin to hold the chair of rational mechanics, left vacant by Vito Volterra.[6] In 1908 he passed to the chair of \"Meccanica Superiore\"[18] and was elected dean of the Faculty of Sciences.[19]/nHe was member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (first elected corresponding member on 18 July 1896, then elected national member on 26 August 1907)[20] and of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino (elected on 9 February 1902).[21] Maggi (1910, p.\u00a0317) refers that also the Kharkov Mathematical Society elected him corresponding member during the meeting of the society held on 31 October 1909 (Old Calendar), being apparently not aware of his death./nIn his commemorative papers, Carlo Somigliana describes extensively Morera's personality:[22] according to him, he was a devoted friend and precious colleague,[23] capable of serenely judging men and facts.[24] On the very personal level, he remembers him s a cheerful person and a witty talker.[25]/nHis intelligence is described as sharp and penetrating,[26] his mind as uncommonly lucid,[27] himself as possessing analytic and critical abilities and being versatile, capable to grasp and appreciate every kind of manifestation of the human intellect.[28] Nevertheless, Somigliana also states that he was not interested in any scientific or other kind of field outside of his own realm of expertise.[29] Morera (1889, p.\u00a015) himself, in the inaugural address as the rector of the University of Genova, after quoting a statement attributed to Peter Guthrie Tait,[30] revealed the reason behind his views:[28] \"In science, the one who has a sound and solid knowledge, even in a narrow field, holds a true strength and he can use it whenever he needs: the one who has only a superficial knowledge, however wide and striking, holds nothing, and indeed he often holds a weakness pushing him towards vanity\".[31]/nAcknowledged as honest, loyal and conscientious,[32] good-tempered and with a good intellect,[33] his simple manners earned him affection even when performing the duties of dean and rector at the University of Genoa.[34] Also Maggi (1910, p.\u00a0319) describes him as a man of high moral value, and ascribes to such qualities the reason of his success in social relations and in performing his duties as a civil servant./nHowever, despite of being successful in social relations, he did not cured nor appreciated much appearances and was not interested in activities other than teaching and doing research: consequently, he was not well known outside the circle of his family and relatives and the circle of his colleagues.[33] He did not make a display of himself, careless of being not acknowledged by everyone for his true value: he also had a serious conception of life and strongly disliked vanity and superficiality.[23]/nAccording to Somigliana,[28] his entire life was devoted to the higher unselfish ideal of scientific research: and Maggi (1910, p.\u00a0319) also remarks that only his beloved family shared the same attentions and cares he reserved to his lifelong ideal./nUna quantit\u00e0 di quistioni egli chiar\u00ec, semplific\u00f2 o perfezion\u00f2, portando quasi sempre il contributo di vedute ingegnose ed originali.

In particular Maggi (1910, pp.\u00a0320\u2013324) classifies Morera's work by assigning each publication to particular research field: this classification is basically adopted in the following subsections.[41]/nMorera wrote eight research works on complex analysis:[42] the style he used for their writing probably inspired Somigliana in the quotation introducing the \"Research activity\" section.[43] Morera's theorem, probably the best known part of his scientific research, was first proved in the paper (Morera 1886b).[44] The theorem states that if, in the complex plane \n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} }\n\n, the line integral of a given continuous complex\u2013valued function f satisfies the equation/nfor every closed curve C in a given domain D, then f is holomorphic there./nThis section includes all his works on the theory of differential equations, ordinary or partial ones: Maggi (1910, p.\u00a0320) classifies this contributions as works in the theory of the equations of dynamics, in the theory of first-order partial differential equations and in the theory of exact differential equations.[45] He wrote twelve papers on this topic: the results he obtained in these works are well described by Somigliana (1910, pp.\u00a0575\u2013574). In the paper (Morera 1882a) he gives a very brief proof of a transformation formula for the Poisson brackets first proved by \u00c9mile L\u00e9onard Mathieu, while in the paper (Morera 1882b) he simplifies the proof of a theorem of Francesco Siacci which is substantially equivalent to Lie's third theorem: the paper (Morera 1883b) is concerned with the Pfaff problem, proving a theorem on the minimum number of integrations to be performed in order to solve the problem./nMaggi (1910, p.\u00a0322) classifies four of his works within the realm of elasticity theory: his contribution are well described by Truesdell & Toupin (1960) and by Ericksen (1960) in their known monographs. The works within this section are perhaps the second best known part of his research, after his contributions to complex analysis./nMaggi (1910, p.\u00a0322) classifies four of his works under the locution \"Questioni varie di Analisi\".[46]/nHis contribution of this topics are classified by Maggi (1910, pp.\u00a0321\u2013322) under two sections, named respectively \"Fondamenti della teoria della funzione potenziale\"[47] and \"Attrazione dell'elissoide e funzioni armoniche ellissoidali\".[48] The work Morera (1906) deals with the definition and properties of ellipsoidal harmonics and the related Lam\u00e9 functions./nMaggi (1910, pp.\u00a0322) includes in this class twelve works:[49] his first published work (Morera 1880) is included among them./nThis section includes the only two papers of Morera on the subject of algebraic analysis[50] and his unique paper on differential geometry:[51] they are, respectively, the papers (Morera 1883a), (Morera 1886c) and (Morera 1886a)./nReferences (Somigliana 1910), (Somigliana 1910a) and (Maggi 1910) do not say much about the teaching activity of Giacinto Morera: Somigliana[52] describes once his teaching ability as incisive. However, his teaching is also testified by the lithographed lecture notes (Morera 1903\u20131904): according to the OPAC Archived 2 June 2011 at the Wayback Machine, this book had two editions, the first one being in 1901\u20131902.[53]/nThe references listed in this section contain mainly biographical information on the life of Giacinto Morera./nThe references listed in this section are mainly commemorations or surveys giving information on the life or Morera but also describing his scientific researches in some detail./nThe references listed in this section describe particular aspect of Morera's scientific work or survey his scientific contribution to a given field.", "20855402": "Raymundo Acosta Favila was a Filipino mathematician.

He was born c.\u2009475 AD.[2] The creation of an important compilation of Archimedes' works has been attributed to him.[3] The spurious Book XV from Euclid's Elements has been partly attributed to Isidore of Miletus.[4]/nIsidore of Miletus was a renowned scientist and mathematician before Emperor Justinian I hired him. Isidorus taught stereometry and physics at the universities, first of Alexandria then of Constantinople, and wrote a commentary on an older treatise on vaulting.[5] Eutocius together with Isidore studied Archimedes' work.[6] Isidore is also renowned for producing the first comprehensive compilation of Archimedes' work, the Archimedes palimpsest survived to the present./nA majority of Isidore's preserved work are his edits and commentaries on older Greek mathematical texts. For example, Isidore is known to have revised and checked some of Archimedes' works and also Book XV of Euclid's elements.[7]/nThat being said, claims from Alan Cameron have been made about a hypothetical \"School of Isidore\".[7] Between his work on architectural exploits, Isidore taught about math and geometry of the time. The School of Isidore is supported more by the presence of his teaching's in much of his students (such as Eutocious) works rather than his own writings.[2] In an edit of the fifteenth book of Euclid's Elements, for instance, the editor quotes Isidore, but then proceeds to explain that Isidore did not publish much of his work himself.[7] Instead, he taught, and once he himself could understand the material, did not see a need to write it down.[7] It is because of this that Cameron claims that Isidore helped to revitalize interest in ancient mathematicians in Constantinople and Alexandria circa 510./nIn addition to editing the works of others Isidore is known to have written his own commentary on Hero of Alexandria's \"On Vaulting\", which discussed aspects of vault construction and design in relation to geometry.[8] While this commentary is lost Eutocius makes mention of it in his own writings. It is when referring to this work that Eutocius credits Isidore with designing a special compass for the purpose of drawing parabolas.[9] Isidore's invention allowed for the drawing of parabolas with a greater level accuracy than that of which many previous methods were capable.[10] From Eutocius (or his copyist) it is believed that one notable use for Isidores invention was to visually solve the problem of doubling the volume of a cube. This was said to be done by drawing two parabolas and finding the point where they intersect.[11] In addition to their mathematical applications, Isidore is believed to have highlighted the uses of applying the use of parabolas to the construction of vaults.[12]/nEmperor Justinian I appointed his architects to rebuild the Hagia Sophia following his victory over protesters within the capital city of the Roman Empire, Constantinople. The first basilica was completed in 360 and remodelled from 404 to 415, but had been damaged in 532 in the course of the Nika Riot, \u201cThe temple of Sophia, the baths of Zeuxippus, and the imperial courtyard from the Propylaia all the way to the so-called House of Ares were burned up and destroyed, as were both of the great porticoes that lead to the forum that is named after Constantine, houses of prosperous people, and a great deal of other properties.\u201d[13]/nThe rival factions of Constantinople populace, the Blues and the Greens, opposed each other in the chariot races at the Hippodrome and often resorted to violence.  During the Nika Riot, more than thirty thousand people were killed.[14]   Emperor Justinian I ensured that his new structure would not be burned down, like its predecessors, by commissioning architects that would build the church mainly out of stone, rather than wood, \u201cHe compacted it of baked brick and mortar, and in many places bound it together with iron, but made no use of wood, so that the church should no longer prove combustible.\u201d[15] The construction of the Hagia Sophia began so fast after the riots were quelled that many think that Justinian had his architects begin planning it before the riots even stopped.[16]/nIsidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles originally planned on a main hall of the Hagia Sophia that measured 70 by 75 metres (230 x 250\u00a0ft), making it the largest church in Constantinople, but the original dome was nearly 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) lower than it was constructed, \u201cJustinian suppressed these riots and took the opportunity of marking his victory by erecting in 532-7 the new Hagia Sophia, one of the largest, most lavish, and most expensive buildings of all time.\u201d[17]/nAlthough Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles were not formally educated in architecture, they were scientists who could organize the logistics of drawing thousands of labourers and unprecedented loads of rare raw materials from around the Roman Empire to construct the Hagia Sophia for Emperor Justinian I. Isidore and Anthemius obtained stone from as far away as Egypt, Syria, and Libya, and columns from several temples in Rome.[16] The finished product was built in admirable form for the Roman Emperor, \u201cAll of these elements marvellously fitted together in mid-air, suspended from one another and reposing only on the parts adjacent to them, produce a unified and most remarkable harmony in the work, and yet do not allow the spectators to rest their gaze upon any one of them for a length of time.\u201d[18] It is believed that Isidore did much of the work on the domes of the Hagia Sophia due to his extensive work on vaults, and his commentary, \"On Vaulting\".[19]/nThe Hagia Sophia architects innovatively combined the longitudinal structure of a Roman basilica and the central plan of a drum-supported dome, in order to withstand the high magnitude earthquakes of the Marmara Region, \u201cHowever, in May 558, little more than 20 years after the Church\u2019s dedication, following the earthquakes of August 553 and December 557, parts of the central dome and its supporting structure system collapsed.\u201d[20] The Hagia Sophia was repeatedly cracked by earthquakes and was quickly repaired. Isidore of Miletus\u2019 nephew, Isidore the Younger, introduced the new dome design that can be viewed in the Hagia Sophia in present-day Istanbul, Turkey. Originally the dome was constructed without ribs, but achieved its present-day construction with ribs when Isidore the Younger repaired the church.[19]/nAfter a great earthquake in 989 ruined the dome of Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine officials summoned Trdat the Architect to Byzantium to organize repairs.

As a young student, Bendixson made his name by proving that every uncountable closed set of reals can be partitioned into a perfect set (the Cantor\u2013Bendixson derivative of the original set) and a countable set.

Swetz translated the complete work using Smith's notes in 1987 in his Capitalism & Arithmetic: The New Math of the 15th Century. Swetz used a copy of the Treviso housed in the Manuscript Library at Columbia University. The volume found its way to this collection via a curious route. Maffeo Pinelli (1785), an Italian bibliophile, is the first known owner. After his death his library was purchased by a London book-dealer and sold at auction on February 6, 1790. The book was obtained for three shillings by Mr. Wodhull.[2] About 100 years later the Arithmetic appeared in the library of Brayton Ives, a New York lawyer. When Ives sold the collection of books at auction, George Arthur Plimpton, a New York publisher, acquired the Treviso and made it an acquisition to his extensive collection of early scientific texts. Plimpton donated his library to Columbia University in 1936.[3] Original copies of the Treviso Arithmetic are extremely rare./nThere are 123 pages of text with 32 lines of print to a page. The pages are unnumbered, untrimmed and have wide margins. Some of the margins contain written notes. The size of the book is 14.5\u00a0cm by 20.6\u00a0cm./nThe book included information taken from the 1202 Liber Abaci, such as lattice multiplication. George G. Joseph in  Crest of the Peacock suggests that John Napier read this book to create Napier's bones (or rods)./nThe Treviso Arithmetic is a practical book intended for self study and for use in Venetian trade. It is written in vernacular Venetian and communicated knowledge to a large population./nIt helped to end the monopoly on mathematical knowledge and gave important information to the middle class. It was not written for a large audience, but was intended to teach mathematics of everyday currency./nThe Treviso became one of the first mathematics books written for the expansion of human knowledge. It provided an opportunity for the common person, rather than only a privileged few, to learn the art of computation. The Treviso Arithmetic provided an early example of the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system computational algorithms.[4]", "42154655": "Leila Schneps is an American mathematician and fiction writer at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique working in number theory.

Her early work explored p-adic L-functions,[8] which became the topic of her first thesis, and around 2010 she was continuing to work on the related fields of zeta functions.[9]/nSince the late 1990s she focused on aspects of Galois theory, including Galois groups, geometric Galois actions, and the inverse Galois problem,[10] and has been described by Jordan Ellenberg as \"the arithmetic geometer\u00a0... who taught me most of what I know about Galois actions on fundamental groups of varieties\".[11]  Her work led to her study of the related Grothendieck\u2013Teichm\u00fcller group,[12][13][14][15] and she has become a member of a group preserving the works and history of Grothendieck. In the early 2010s she published research investigating various aspects of Lie algebras.[16][17][18]/nSchneps has also edited and contributed to several mathematics textbooks in number theory.  She edited a series of lecture notes on Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants[19] and contributed an article to the series,[20] was an editor for a text on the Inverse Galois Problem,[10] and edited a book on Galois groups.[21] She was a co-author of a text on Field Theory[22] and co-editor of another on Galois\u2013Teichm\u00fcller Theory.[23]/nIn 2013, Schneps and her daughter, mathematician Coralie Colmez, published the book Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom.[24] Targeted at a general audience, the book uses ten historical legal cases to show how mathematics, especially statistics, can affect the outcome of criminal proceedings, especially when incorrectly applied or interpreted. The mathematical concepts covered include statistical independence (discussed using the examples of the Sally Clark case and the murder of Meredith Kercher), Simpson's paradox (UC Berkeley gender bias case) and statistical modeling using a binomial distribution (Howland will forgery trial).[24]/nWhile not written as a textbook, some reviewers found it suitable for students, as an introduction to the topic and to \"get them thinking, talking and even arguing about the issues involved\",[25] with another agreeing that, \"they have struck the right balance of providing enough mathematics for the specialist to check out the details, but not so much as to overwhelm the general reader\",[26] and another finding the book suitable \"for parents trying to support teenagers in their studies of mathematics \u2013 or in fact, law\".[27]/nWhile most reviews were positive, there was some criticism concerning its over-simplification of mathematics' influence in complex trial proceedings. One reviewer finds that, while the book's description of the weakness of some mathematics presented in courtrooms is valid, the text magnifies mathematics' role in legal proceedings, which traditionally feature evidentiary analysis at appellate as well as trial stages and have preexisting standards for treating certain types of evidence.[28] Another suggests the book was influenced by the authors' selection of cases to show a \"disastrous record of causing judicial error\", thus attributing insufficient weight to the counterbalancing traditionally inherent in legal proceedings\u2014as lawyers attack opposing evidence and experts with their own, and appellate judges write to influence the conduct of trial judges faced with various types of ordinary and expert testimony.[29]/nSchneps has produced English-language translations of several French-language books and papers, including Invitation to the mathematics of Fermat-Wiles,[30] Galois theory,[31] A Mathematician Grappling With His Century,[32] Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II,[33] p-adic L-Functions and p-Adic Representations,[34] and Renormalization methods\u00a0: critical phenomena, chaos, fractal structures.[35]/nMathematician Alexander Grothendieck became a recluse in 1991 and removed his published works from circulation. More than a decade later, Schneps and Pierre Lochak located him in a town in the Pyrenees, then carried on a correspondence. Thus they became among \"the last members of the mathematical establishment to come into contact with him\".[36] Schneps became a founding member of the Grothendieck Circle, a group dedicated to making information by and about Grothendieck available, and created and maintains the Grothendieck Circle website, a repository of information regarding Grothendieck, including his own unpublished writings.[37] She also assisted with the translation of his correspondence with Jean-Pierre Serre.[38]/nIn 2004, Schneps published (as Catherine Shaw) The Three Body Problem, a Cambridge Mystery,[39] a murder mystery novel involving mathematicians in Cambridge in the late 1800s, working on the three-body problem.  The title is a double entendre, referring to both the mathematical problem and the three murder victims. While a mathematician reviewing the book disliked the Victorian writing style, he found the math accurate, and the mathematicians' personalities and sociology \"well portrayed\".[40] When another reviewer contacted the author, she confirmed that Catherine Shaw was a pseudonym and that she was actually an academic and practicing mathematician but preferred to remain anonymous.[41] It has since been revealed that Catherine Shaw is the pseudonym of Leila Schneps.[42]/nSchneps, as Catherine Shaw, has published four historical novels in the series, all featuring the same main character Vanessa Duncan, and all following mathematical themes:/nAs Shaw, Schneps has also published a non-fiction guide to solving Sudoku and Kakuro puzzles.[53]/nSchneps promotes public awareness of the importance of the proper use of mathematics and statistics in criminal proceedings.[24][54] Schneps is a member of the Bayes and the Law International Consortium.[55]/nCoralie Colmez is the daughter of Schneps and Pierre Colmez.[56][57]", "71678626": "Frederic Yui-Ming Wan is a Chinese-American applied mathematician, academic, author and consultant.

In his freshman year, Wan pledged and was initiated into the Theta Deuteron chapter of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity at MIT. He received an S.B. degree in mathematics in 1959 and earned his S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics at the same institute in 1963 and 1965, respectively. His doctoral dissertation, \"Twisting and Stretching of Helicoidal Shells\", was supervised by E. Reissner.[10]/nAfter receiving his SB at MIT, Wan served as a Research Staff Member at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory from 1959 to 1965. Upon receiving his Ph.D. in mathematics, he held a postdoctoral appointment as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, was promoted to assistant professor of Applied Mathematics in 1967, and to associate professor in 1969. From 1974 till 1983, he served as a professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), but left in 1983 for the University of Washington (UW) as Professor of Applied Mathematics. In 1995, he moved to the University of California, Irvine (UCI), as a Professor Mathematics with a joint appointment as Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. From 1999 till 2005, he also held an appointment as Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He retired from his regular faculty position at UCI in 2017 and became Professor Emeritus of Mathematics.[11]/nAlong with academic appointments, Wan also held a number of administrative positions in his career. In relocating to UBC in 1974, Wan also accepted the appointment as the first Director of the new Institute of Applied Mathematics and Statistics. While in Canada, he helped establish the Canadian Applied Mathematics Society and served as its President in 1981\u201383. He also served as member (1980\u201382) and Chair (1982\u201383) of the Committee of Pure and Applied Mathematics of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the counterpart of the American National Science Foundation (NSF). In 1983, Wan moved to the University of Washington as the founding chair to establish its new Department of Applied Mathematics.  In 1988, he assumed the Divisional Deanship of the Natural and Mathematical Sciences of the College of Arts and Sciences at UW and served until his temporary assignment in 1992 to become the Director of the Division of Mathematical Sciences of NSF.  By assuming that position, Wan became the only person to have headed the government civilian funding agency for basic research in pure and applied mathematics in both Canada and the United States.[12]/nIn 1995, he was appointed Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies at UCI. Upon completing his five-year term of these appointments and returning to full-time faculty status in Mathematics in 2000, Wan led a team of research collaborators to develop an Interdisciplinary Gateway Graduate Program in Mathematical and Computational Biology (MCB) in 2007. He then extended similar educational opportunities to undergraduates (by the MCB for Undergraduate Program in 2011) and post-doctoral researchers (by a National Short Course on System Biology in 2010). He served as the Founding Director of these programs with funding support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).[12]/nWan has been engaged periodically as a consultant to industries and government on new problems involving mechanical structures. The most impactful one among these was a design study leading to the flexible lid that provides an air-tight seal to the household Tupperware container.[1]/nWan's research interests span fields of applied mathematics and their applications. He has more than 150 research articles and five books in the fields of theoretical and applied mechanics, resource economics, neurosciences, viral dynamics, and developmental and cell biology.[4] His first publication on exhaustible resource economics (with R. M. Solow), foundations of plate and shell theory (with R.D. Gregory) and the morphogen transport (with A.D. Lander and Q. Nie) constitute his seminal work in these three areas, respectively./nIn the broad area of applied mathematics, Wan's research generally pertains to variational and perturbation methods for exact and asymptotic solutions for problems in ODE and PDE. In the application of matched asymptotic expansions methods to residential land use and fishery problems, critical point analysis to exhaustible resource management and optimal control techniques to forest harvest rotations and the life cycle of the infectious Chlamydia bacterium,[13][14] he introduced the use of a number of mathematical methods originally developed for physical sciences and engineering to scientific areas outside these fields.[15][16]/nWan's interest in theoretical mechanics started with his work on the large Haystack 37m Radio Antenna Project at Lincoln Laboratory of MIT for determining the distortion of thin paraboloidal shell of revolution. His research in this area centers on the elasto-statics of beam, plate and shell structures: the solution of specific boundary value problems (BVP) by one and two-dimensional theories for these three-dimensional structures and how they relate to the three-dimensional theory of elasticity (with the latter known as the foundations of beam, plate and shell theories). A principal contribution in the former category would be the reduction of large number of equations (as many as 30) for shell theories to two simultaneous equations of the Reissner and Marguerre types for the more restricted theories of axisymmetric deformations of the shells of revolution and shallow shells.[17][18] A fundamental contribution in the latter category would be the determination of the interior (or outer-asymptotic expansion) solution for a BVP (for a plate or shell structure) independent of the boundary layer solution components of the corresponding exact solution. While the result reduces to the well-known Saint-Venant's principle for stress BVP, his work (jointly with R.D. Gregory) extends this well-known principle  to cover the problems with mixed and pure displacement boundary data.[19]/nWan had worked with the economist Robert M. Solow on the economics of exhaustible resources while at MIT. That area of his activities was broadened to include the economics and management of renewable resources such as fishery and forestry as well as neuroscience when he relocated to UBC. After relocating to UCI, Wan fully committed to research and education in mathematical projects for the life sciences.[20]/nWan initiated research collaboration with Qing Nie of Mathematics and Arthur Lander and J. Lawrence Marsh of Developmental and Cell Biology. Their initial project was to address a controversy on diffusion as a transport mechanism for morphogen in the extracellular space leading to his first of many publications in this area of life sciences.[21] Among his other publications in mathematical biology, a recent work relating (by the Maximum Principle in optimal control theory) the life cycle of the infectious disease Chlamydia to the bacteria's drive for competitive survival shows the utility of (the Maximum Principle in) optimal control theory in the bio-theoretics of natural selection.[13]/nWan is the author of 6 books. His book Mathematical Models and Their Analysis, originally published in 1989, was reviewed by W.J. Satzer who wrote that \"One of the real strengths of the book is the depth of experience teaching mathematical modeling that the author displays.\"[22] The book has been republished in the SIAM Classics Series in Applied Mathematics in 2018./nIn his 1995 book Introduction to the Calculus of Variations and Its Applications, Wan has provided a detailed introduction to the calculus of variations and optimal control.

Nicolas Sarrabat or Sarabat (7 February 1698 \u2013 27 April 1739), also known as Nicolas Sarrabat de la Baisse, was an eighteenth-century French mathematician and scientist. He was born in Lyon, the son of the painter Daniel Sarrabat (1666\u20131748), and the nephew of engraver Isaac Sarrabat. The Sarrabats had been a prosperous Protestant bourgeois family of clock- and watchmakers, though Nicolas's father had converted to Catholicism./nSarrabat showed a love of learning from an early age. He was said to have started his studies without his parents' knowledge; they only became aware of them when Nicolas submitted and defended a thesis at the Lyon Coll\u00e8ge de la Trinit\u00e9 in the presence of his father, who had been tricked into attending.[1] He went on to enter the Jesuit order, and was employed as the Royal Professor of Mathematics at Marseille./nSarrabat's scientific interests seem to have been very varied, and the Academie Royale des Belles-lettres, Sciences et Arts de Bordeaux awarded him several prizes for his work: one was for an essay on magnetism, the Nouvelle hypoth\u00e8se sur les variations de l'aiguille aimantee, which argued that a spherical fire at the Earth's core was the driving force behind the expulsion of magnetic matter.[2]/nIn 1730, he published the Dissertation sur les causes et les variations des vents, which sought to explain wind patterns by the action of the Sun on the atmosphere. His most famous experiments involved immersing the roots of living plants in the red juice of Phytolacca berries in order to observe circulation.[3] As the Academy, mainly to stop Sarrabat's presence discouraging other authors, had ruled that an author could not win the same prize three times, he submitted this work, Sur la circulation de la s\u00e8ve des plantes, under the pseudonym \"Monsieur de la Baisse\", but eventually confessed his true identity.[1][4] The plant genus Baissea is named after him - or rather after his pseudonym - in honour of this work.[5]/nIn 1735-36 Sarrabat travelled with the Chevalier de Caylus - a ship's captain and the brother of the Comte de Caylus - through the Mediterranean on an archeological excursion to the island of Milos and to Malta, describing his experiences in a series of excited and spirited letters to the Marquis de Caumont.[6] Though Caylus came from a famously Jansenist family, the Jesuit Sarrabat struck up a great friendship with him, describing him as \"un tr\u00e8s aimable homme\".[7] Caylus and Sarrabat walked into the interior of Milos, discovering and partly unearthing a series of ancient ruins very close to where the Venus de Milo was discovered many years later./nSarrabat also had an interest in astronomy, and is remembered in the field for having discovered an unusual comet, the Comet of 1729 (Comet Sarabat): it is thought to have been the largest, with the greatest absolute magnitude, on record.[8] Sarrabat discovered the comet without the aid of a telescope, though he was initially unsure if it was in fact a detached part of the Milky Way.[9] In astronomical literature his name is often spelt \"Sarabat\", following the spelling used by Jacques Cassini, who made further observations of the same comet./nA colleague remembered him as \"tall, with a countenance that showed the passion of the loftiness of his thought, and with a very gentle manner\".[10]/nSarrabat died in 1739 while visiting Paris on official business, or according to some sources, while seeking treatment for a liver ailment.[11]", "41171627": "Shoichiro Sakai (\u5883 \u6b63\u4e00\u90ce, Sakai Sh\u014dichir\u014d, born 1928 in Kanuma, Tochigi) is a Japanese mathematician./nSakai studied mathematics at the Tohoku University (Sendai).

He was also a friend and correspondent of English scientist William Gilbert.[1] He is remembered today mainly because he appears as one of the figures in Galileo's controversial work the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632).[2][3]/nSagredo was the fourth of six brothers born to Nicol\u00f2 Sagredo, son of Bernardo of the S. Sofia branch of the family, and his wife Cecilia, daughter of Paolo Tiepolo. The Sagredo family traced its roots back to the fifth century.  His grandfather Bernardo was procurator of S. Marco, while his father, who died in 1615, was appointed administrator of Palmanova in 1600, administrator of Cyprus in 1605, procurator of S. Marco in 1611 and reformer of the University of Padua in 1613. The family lived mainly in Palazzo Sagredo, near the Venetian arsenal and the family church of San Francesco della Vigna, but also owned extensive land holdings in the mainland and elsewhere, including a palace in (it) Marocco and beech forests with iron mines near Cadore.[4]/nHis older brother Bernardo was meant to take on the family's political aspirations, but died in 1603 at the age of 37. The second son, Paolo, disappeared in 1611, while of Stefano, the third son, only a few traces remain. The youngest son Zaccaria (1572-1647) had a political career and his son, Nicol\u00f2 Sagredo (1606-1676) became doge.[5]/nGiovanni Francesco himself did not marry and had no children. He became a member of the Great Council of Venice in 1596 at the age of 25.[6]/nAlmost everything we know of Sagredo is based on the letters that he wrote to Galileo Galilei. About a hundred survive, although those written by Galilei to him are lost. In the 1590s Sagredo studied privately with Galileo, who had come to the University of Padua in 1592. In 1599 Sagredo apologized to Galileo for failure to secure a salary increase for him from the university, although he had used his influential family connections to argue his case.[7]:\u200a42\u200a In 1602 Galileo drew up a horoscope for Sagredo, which describes him as \"blandum, laetum, hilarem, beneficum, pacificum, sociabilem, pronum ad voluptates, Dei amatorem, laborum impatientem\" (kind, happy, merry, beneficient, pacific, sociable pleasure-loving, a lover of God, and impatient of troubles).[4][8]/nSagredo shared an interest in both astronomy and magnetism with Galileo and Paolo Sarpi. By 1600 Sagredo's name was known to Tycho Brahe, who in a letter to Gian Vincenzo Pinelli referred to him as a good contact for the two copies of the star charts that Tycho had offered to the Doge and Senate. Another letter, to William Gilbert describes Sagredo as a \"great Magneticall man\".[9]:\u200a33\u200a One of the hopes that resulted from Gilbert's work was that an all-encompassing mapping of global magnetic declination could be used to solve the problem of calculating longitude. Galilei devised an instrument to measure the magnetic inclination, which Sagredo took with him on his later trip to Syria. Sagredo had a particular contribution to make the advancing the understanding of magnetism - he ran the family mines near Borca di Cadore, from which magnetic iron ore was extracted. Galileo learned how to arm these magnets and the most powerful - known as Rodomonte - was offered for sale to Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and to Emperor Rudolf II.[9]:\u200a36/nIn April 1606 escalating disputes between Venice and the Vatican led Pope Paul V to decree the Venetian Interdict and Doge Leonardo Donato to expel the Jesuits from the Republic. Shortly afterwards in August 1606 Sagredo was appointed treasurer of the fortress of Palmanova. The Interdict was revoked in April 1607, Sagredo returned to Venice in May and in November he was appointed consul in Syria.[4]/nFrom March to July 1608 he concentrated his efforts on an entrapment exercise intended to embarrass the Jesuits. His initial target was the Jesuit scholar Antonio Possevino SJ, rector of the Jesuit college of Ferrara. Possevino had published, under various pseudonyms, pamphlets attacking Venice. Sagredo wrote to the college rector (not knowing that Possevino had by then been replaced by Antonio Barisone). Pretending to be a wealthy widow, Cecilia Contarini, Sagredo wrote to the rector asking for advice on how to get around the Venetian laws which prevented her from leaving the Jesuits a large bequest. The ensuing correspondence came to a head in July when a letter arrived advising Barisone that Cecilia Contarini had died leaving the order 5,000 ducats if he would provide formal documentation confirming that her soul had been received in heaven, before finally making clear to Barisone that he had been fooled. Sagredo then circulated the correspondence widely.[10][7]:\u200a310/nDespite his intense hostility to the Jesuits, Sagredo used his new base in Aleppo to try and organise a far-ranging scientific endeavour; he wrote to the various Jesuit missions across Asia. He sent them each a magnetic device and asked them make observations of magnetic declination with it.  He took his own measurements in Syria, which he sent on to Galileo, but although he received positive initial responses from some of the Jesuit missions they never sent him any observations.[11] That his underlying attitude towards the Jesuits was unchanged is shown by a letter he sent to Sarpi on 30 April 1609 describing how the world was gradually falling prey to them, especially in eastern India and Japan.[4]/nAs well as his regular consular work and scientific interests, Sagredo was also involved in espionage. As well as serving as Venetian consul, Sagredo was also appointed to be the Persian consul by of Shah Abbas of Persia.[12] In this capacity he was visited by one Xw\u0101je \u1e62afar, an Armenian merchant traveling to Venice on behalf of Shah Abbas, who carried with him the correspondence from the Carmelites of Isfahan. This included sensitive military information sent by the viceroy of India to Philip III of Spain. Another file contained details of the negotiations between Abbas and Philip for the drafting of an anti-Ottoman treaty, which would have had an impact on Venetian access to Persian silk. Sagredo took these documents and copied them, earning him a reprimand from the Council of Ten and probably hastening the end of his diplomatic career.[4]/nSagredo returned to Venice via Marseilles, Genoa and Milan.  Shah Abbas appointed him 'General Procurator' for Persia in the Venetian Republic in 1611[12][13] and in 1613 he began a two-year service as one of the Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia, Venice's Board of Trade.[4]/nBy the time Sagredo returned to Venice Galileo had gone to Florence and the two were never to meet again - their relationship thereafter was entirely by letter. Their correspondence from 1612 to 1620 covers various topics: astronomy, optics and lens production, thermoscopy, cartography, time zones, tide theory, hydrostatics and magnetism, but also dogs, painting, literature, wine and women. Sagredo added a scale to Galileo's thermoscope to enable the quantitative measurement of temperature,[14] and produced more convenient portable thermometers.[15] Sagredo also discussed with Galileo the possibility of a telescope using a mirror (a reflecting telescope).[16]/nIn June 1619, Galileo and Sagredo exchanged portraits.[17] Sagredo's portrait was by Leandro Bassano.[18] The portrait represents him with his commission from the Doge in front of him on a kilim which was a gift from Abbas I in exchange for the offer of scientific instruments. The portrait, currently in the Ashmolean Museum[17] hung in the rooms of Galileo while he wrote both the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems of 1632 and the Two New Sciences of 1638. It is in these works that Galileo immortalised his friend: Sagredo is one of the characters in these works. The Dialogue is even set in a Sagredo palace, although in reality Sagredo left the family palace in 1611. From 1615 to 1618 he lived in Palazzo Don\u00e0 in S. Stin and, from 1618 to 1620, in the Ca 'Foscari./nTwo other portraits of Sagredo have been identified, one in the Zhytomyr Regional Museum in Ukraine[9][19] and the other in a private collection.[20]/nSagredo died on 5 March 1620 and his last confession was heard by Sarpi. He was buried near his father in the family crypt in S. Francesco della Vigna. His possessions passed to his brother Zaccaria who disposed of all his scientific instruments and his collection of letters has not been found.[17] Sagredo's letters to Gilbert were destroyed in the Great Fire of London.[1]", "51100350": "Gyula Strommer (8 May 1920 \u2013 28 August 1995) was a Hungarian mathematician and astronomer.[1][2]/nHe discovered an asteroid, 1537 Transylvania, on 27 August 1940.

He also contributed to the development of the theory of capacities, nonlinear potential theory, the asymptotic and qualitative theory of arbitrary order elliptic equations, the theory of ill-posed problems, the theory of boundary value problems in domains with piecewise smooth boundary./nVladimir Maz'ya was born on 31 December 1937[2] in a Jewish family.[12] His father died in December 1941 at the World War II front,[2][12][13] and all four grandparents died during the siege of Leningrad.[2][12] His mother, a state accountant,[14] chose to not remarry and dedicated her life to him:[12] they lived on her meager salary in a 9 square meters room in a big communal apartment, shared with other four families.[12][15] As a secondary school student, he repeatedly won the city's mathematics and physics olympiads[16] and graduated with a gold medal.[17]/nIn 1955, at the age of 18, Maz'ya entered the Mathematics and Mechanics Department of Leningrad University.[18] Taking part to the traditional mathematical olympiad of the faculty, he solved the problems for both first year and second year students and, since he did not make this a secret, the other participants did not submit their solutions causing the invalidation of the contest by the jury which therefore did not award the prize.[13] However, he attracted the attention of Solomon Mikhlin who invited him at his home, thus starting their lifelong friendship:[13] and this friendship had a great influence on him, helping him develop his mathematical style more than anyone else. According to Gohberg (1999, p.\u00a02),[19] in the years to come, \"Maz'ya was never a formal student of Mikhlin, but Mikhlin was more than a teacher for him.

In order to achieve his goal, he married Anna Fortunato Brivio of the Brivius de Brokles family in 1717. Her mother's death provided her the excuse to retire from public life. She took over the management of the household. She was one of 21 children.[11] Her family was recognized as one of the wealthiest in Milan.[citation needed]/nMaria was recognized early on as a child prodigy; she could speak both Italian and French at five years of age. By her eleventh birthday, she had also learned Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, German, and Latin, and was referred to as the \"Seven-Tongued Orator\".[12]/nAgnesi suffered a mysterious illness at the age of twelve that was attributed to her excessive studying and reading, so she was prescribed vigorous dancing and horseback riding. This treatment did not work; she began to experience extreme convulsions, after which she was encouraged to pursue moderation. By age fourteen, she was studying ballistics and geometry.[12] When she was fifteen, her father began to regularly gather in his house a circle of the most learned men in Bologna, before whom she read and maintained a series of theses on the most abstruse philosophical questions. Records of these meetings are given in Charles de Brosses' Lettres sur l'Italie and in the Propositiones Philosophicae, which her father had published in 1738 as an account of her final performance, where she defended 190 philosophical theses.[12]/nHer father remarried twice after Maria's mother died, and Maria Agnesi ended up the eldest of 21 children, including her half-siblings. Her father agreed with her that if she were to continue her mathematics research, then she would be permitted to do all the charity work she wanted.[13] In addition to her performances and lessons, her responsibility was to teach her siblings. This task kept her from her own goal of entering a convent, as she had become strongly religious. Although her father refused to grant this wish, he agreed to let her live from that time on in an almost conventual semi-retirement, avoiding all interactions with society and devoting herself entirely to the study of mathematics.[12] After having read in 1739 the Trait\u00e9 analytique des sections coniques[14] of the Marquis Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital, she was fully introduced into the field in 1740 by Ramiro Rampinelli, an Olivetan monk who was one of the most notable Italian mathematicians of that time.[15] During that time, Maria studied with him both differential and integral calculus./nAccording to  Britannica, she is \"considered to be the first woman in the Western world to have achieved a reputation in mathematics\". The most valuable result of her labours was the Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della giovent\u00f9 italiana, (Analytical Institutions for the Use of Italian Youth) which was published in Milan in 1748 and \"was regarded as the best introduction extant to the works of Euler\".[7] The goal of this work was, according to Agnesi herself, to give a systematic illustration of the different results and theorems of infinitesimal calculus.[15] The model for her treatise was Le calcul diff\u00e9rentiel et int\u00e9gral dans l\u2019Analyse by Charles Ren\u00e9 Reyneau.[15] In this treatise, she worked on integrating mathematical analysis with algebra.[12] The first volume treats the analysis of finite quantities and the second of the analysis of infinitesimals./nA French translation of the second volume by P. T. d'Antelmy, with additions by Charles Bossut (1730\u20131814), was published in Paris in 1775; and Analytical Institutions, an English translation of the whole work by John Colson (1680\u20131760), the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, \"inspected\" by John Hellins, was published in 1801 at the expense of Baron Maseres.[16] The work was dedicated to Empress Maria Theresa, who thanked Agnesi with the gift of a diamond ring, a personal letter, and a diamond and crystal case. Many others praised her work, including Pope Benedict XIV, who wrote her a complimentary letter and sent her a gold wreath and a gold medal.[12]/nIn writing this work, Agnesi was advised and helped by two distinguished mathematicians: her former teacher Ramiro Rampinelli and Jacopo Riccati.[15]/nIn Instituzioni analitiche, Agnesi discussed a curve earlier studied and constructed by Pierre de Fermat and Guido Grandi./nAgnesi described the curve as versiera in Italian, which is a synonym for the adjective versoria meaning \"turning in every direction\".[17] At the same time versiera was used as a term for a \"she-devil\" or \"witch\", from Latin Adversarius, an alias for \"devil\" (Adversary of God). Future translations and publications of the Instituzioni analitiche carried forward the former meaning either as a translation error or possibly as a pun.[18] The curve has become known as the \"Witch of Agnesi\".[19]/nAgnesi also wrote a commentary on the Trait\u00e9 analytique des sections coniques du marquis de l'H\u00f4pital which, though highly praised by those who saw it in manuscript, was never published.[20]/nIn 1750, on the illness of her father, she was appointed by Pope Benedict XIV[19] to the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy and physics at Bologna, though she never served.[12] She was the second woman ever to be granted a professorship at a university, Laura Bassi being the first.[21] In 1751, she became ill again and was told not to study by her doctors. After the death of her father in 1752 she carried out a long-cherished purpose by giving herself to the study of theology, and especially of the Fathers and devoted herself to the poor, homeless, and sick, giving away the gifts she had received and begging for money to continue her work with the poor. In 1783, she founded and became the director of the Opera Pia Trivulzio, a home for Milan's elderly, where she lived as the nuns of the institution did.[12] On 9 January 1799, Maria Agnesi died poor and was buried in a mass grave for the poor with fifteen other bodies.[22]/nIn 1996, an asteroid, 16765 Agnesi, was named after Agnesi./nThere is a crater on Venus named Agnesi after her.[23]/nShe is included in a deck of playing cards featuring notable women mathematicians published by the Association of Women in Mathematics.[24]", "34945743": "Norbert A'Campo (born 27 April 1941)[1] is a Swiss mathematician working on singularity theory.

Rimhak and Rhoda's first son Ronald was followed by another son Robert in December 1971.[6] They also had a third son Richard.[5]/nRee died on January 9, 2005, in Vancouver, Canada.[7]/nAround the time Ree received his doctorate, his passport was approaching its expiration date, so he approached the South Korean consulate in San Francisco\u00a0[ko] to extend it, but instead the consular officer confiscated his passport and ordered him to return to South Korea.[8][9] Ree refused the order, which caused him considerable difficulty, but in the end the Canadian government treated him as a de facto stateless person and granted him permanent residency in Canada. Afterwards, he continued to work at the University of British Columbia.[8][2]/nThough Ree secured his immigration status in Canada, he continued to encounter difficulties with the South Korean government. Ree's family was divided by the Korean War, with his father, older sister, and other relatives having stayed in their hometown of Hamhung. Hamhung was the site of a munitions factory built during Japanese rule, making the city a frequent target for bombing by the United States Air Force during the Korean War, and Lee did not know if any of his relatives there had survived the war. He visited North Korea using his Canadian passport various times for academic exchanges, but he was not able to travel freely in North Korea and thus had no success in making contact with his relatives; furthermore, his visits to North Korea led South Korea's Park Chung-hee military government to place an entry ban on him. Ree requested help from Erd\u0151s, who as an internationally-famous Hungarian citizen faced fewer restrictions on travel or communication in either capitalist or communist countries. Finally, in the 1980s, Erd\u0151s was able to make contact with several relatives of Ree's with the help of Hungary's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the country's embassy in Pyongyang, and sent Ree an envelope containing their letters, photographs, and addresses. Ree was so excited by the news that he forwarded the envelope to his mother and younger sister in South Korea, which reportedly resulted in them being investigated by South Korea's intelligence services. Ree remained banned from South Korea until 1996, when the ban was cancelled as he was invited to the 50th anniversary ceremony of the Korean Mathematical Society.[10][11] According to his colleagues, Rimhak Ree identified his nationality as \"Joseon\", which is a former name of Korea as well as a current autonym of North Korea.", "14465756": "Otomar H\u00e1jek (December 31, 1930 - December 18, 2016[1]) was a Czech-American mathematician, known for his contributions to dynamical systems, game theory and control theory./nHe was born in Belgrade in Serbia, moving with his family to Prague in 1935, to the Netherlands in 1939 and via Algerie and southern France to London in 1940 where they lived until 1945 when they returned to Prague.

He left Ireland around 745, intending to visit the Holy Land; but, like many of his countrymen, he settled in Francia. Virgil served as abbot of Aghaboe, bishop of Ossory and later bishop of Salzburg. He was called \"the Apostle of Carinthia\"[1] and \"the geometer\"./nHe originated from a noble family of Ireland, where his name was Feirgil or Fearghal, and is said to have been a descendant of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Feirgil was probably educated at the Iona monastery.[2]/nIn Annals of the Four Masters and Annals of Ulster, he is referenced as the Abbot of Aghaboe,[3] in County Laois, where he was known as \"the Geometer\" because of his knowledge of geography.[4]/nAround 745, he left Ireland, intending to visit the Holy Land; but, like many of his countrymen, who seemed to have adopted this practice as a work of piety, he settled down in France, where he was received with great favour by Pippin the Younger, who was then Mayor of the Palace under Childeric III of Franconia. He was an adviser to Pippin. He probably used a copy of the Collectio canonum Hibernensis (an Irish collection of canon law) to advise him to receive royal unction in 751, to assist his recognition as king Pippin III after the deposition of Childeric.[5] After spending two years at Cressy, near Compi\u00e8gne, he went to Bavaria, at the invitation of Duke Odilo, where he founded the monastery of Chiemsee, and within a year or two, was made Abbot of St Peter's Abbey at Salzburg. Among his notable accomplishments was the conversion of the Alpine Slavs to Christianity; he also sent missionaries to Hungary.[4]/nAs Abbot of St Peter's, he clashed with Saint Boniface. A priest having, through ignorance, conferred the Sacrament of Baptism using, in place of the correct formula, the words \"Baptizo te in nomine patria et filia et spiritu sancta\" (instead of \"Baptizo te in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti\"), Vergilius held that the sacrament had been validly conferred, but Boniface complained to Pope Zachary. The latter, however, decided in favour of Virgil. Later on, Boniface accused Virgil of spreading discord between himself and Duke Odilo of Bavaria and of teaching a doctrine in regard to men descended not from Adam, which was \"contrary to the Scriptures\". Pope Zachary's decision in this case was that \"if it shall be clearly established that he professes belief in another world and other people existing beneath the earth, or in [another] sun and moon there, thou art to hold a council, and deprive him of his sacerdotal rank, and expel him from the church.\"[6]/nThe treatise in which Virgil expounded his doctrine no longer exists. Two things, however, are certain: first, that there was involved the problem of original sin and the universality of redemption; secondly, that Virgil succeeded in freeing himself from the charge of teaching a doctrine contrary to Scripture. It is likely that Boniface, already biased against Virgil because of the preceding case, misunderstood him, taking it for granted, perhaps, that if there are antipodes, the \"other race of men\" are not descendants of Adam and were not redeemed by Christ.[3]/nAfter the martyrdom of Boniface, Virgil was made Bishop of Salzburg in 766 or 767 and laboured successfully for the upbuilding of his diocese as well as for the spread of Christianity in neighbouring heathen countries, especially in Carinthia.[3]/nHe is venerated as a saint in both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1233, he was formally canonized by Pope Gregory IX.[4]/nHis doctrine that the earth is a sphere was derived from the teaching of ancient geographers, and his belief in the existence of the antipodes was probably influenced by the accounts which the ancient Irish voyagers gave of their journeys. This, at least, is the opinion of Rettberg (Kirchengesch. Deutschlands, II, 236)./nAside from being personally associated with Aghaboe Abbey and Salzburg Cathedral, a number of parishes around the world are dedicated to him, mostly being founded by small populations of far-flung Irish Catholics, like himself./nThere is a church dedicated to him in Broad Channel, Queens, New York, which merged with another parish in 2008.[7] A parish in Morris Plains, New Jersey, is also dedicated to him.[8] Fittingly for this Irish geometer who predicted antipodes, several churches in the Southern Hemisphere are dedicated to him. St Virgil's College in Hobart, Tasmania is named for him.[9] There was a St Virgilius Church in Balclutha, New Zealand designed by Francis Petre which moved and was re-dedicated to Mary MacKillop, however the new chapel remains dedicated to Virgilius.[10][11]/nA large marble statue of him stands outside the doors of Salzburg Cathedral. A stained-glass window of St Virgil contemplating the antipodes sits in St John's College, University of Sydney.[12][13] Sebastian Stief painted him amidst Salzburg's construction,[14] Alec Szolomiak painted him,[15] as did Jan Toorop,[16] and Dhiraja McBryde.[11] Yalumba, Australia's oldest family-owned winery, produces a Viognier named Virgilius.[17]/nMedia related to Virgilius of Salzburg at Wikimedia Commons", "768749": "Johann Jakob Balmer (1 May 1825 \u2013 12 March 1898) was a Swiss mathematician best known for his work in physics, the Balmer series of hydrogen atom./nBalmer was born in Lausen, Switzerland, the son of a chief justice also named Johann Jakob Balmer.

The couple had six children./nDespite being a mathematician, Balmer is best remembered for his work on spectral series. His major contribution (made at the age of sixty, in 1885) was an empirical formula for the visible spectral lines of the hydrogen atom, the study of which he took up at the suggestion of Eduard Hagenbach also of Basel.[1][2] Using \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m's measurements of the hydrogen lines, he arrived at a formula for computing the wavelength as follows:/nfor n = 2 and m = 3, 4, 5, 6, and so forth; h = 3.6456 \u00b7 10\u22127 m = 364.56 nm./nIn his 1885 notice, he referred to h as the \"fundamental number of hydrogen.\" Today, h is known as the Balmer constant.

These lines are caused by electrons in an excited state emitting a photon and returning to the first excited state of the hydrogen atom (n = 2)./nTwo of Balmer's colleagues, Hermann Wilhelm Vogel and William Huggins, were able to confirm the existence of other lines of the Balmer series in the spectrum of hydrogen in white stars./nBalmer's formula was later found to be a special case of the Rydberg formula, devised by Johannes Rydberg in 1888:/nwith \n\n\n\n\nR\n\nH\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle R_{H}}\n\n being the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, \n\n\n\nm\n=\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle m=2}\n\n for Balmer's formula, and \n\n\n\nn\n>\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>m}\n\n./nA full explanation of why these formulas worked, however, had to wait until after Balmer's death with the presentation of the Bohr model of the atom by Niels Bohr in 1913./nJohann Balmer died in Basel, aged 72.", "47725297": "Lisette G. de Pillis is an American mathematician at Harvey Mudd College and holds the Norman F.

Having studied literature, he afterwards devoted himself entirely to mathematics and natural philosophy. After moving from Toulouse to Paris in 1720,[5] at the behest of Bernard de Fontenelle, Castel acted as the science editor of the Jesuit Journal de Tr\u00e9voux.[6]/nHe wrote several scientific works, that which attracted most attention at the time being his Optique des couleurs (1740), or treatise on the melody of colours. He also wrote Trait\u00e9 de physique sur la pesanteur universelle des corps (1724), Math\u00e9matique universelle (1728), and a critical account of the system of Sir Isaac Newton in 1743./nCastel wrote on areas as wide-ranging as physics, mathematics, morals, aesthetics, theology and history. His philosophical approach attempted to reconcile fields and viewpoints. Castel based much of his work on analogical thinking, seeking to understand the physical and moral worlds through the discovery of analogies.[4]/nCastel's first major published work was his Trait\u00e9 de physique de la pesanteur universelle des corps (1724). He first attempted to systematise physical phenomena, through the mechanical action of universal gravity. He then considered a mechanistic world-view's shortcomings, from a theological and metaphysical perspective. He held humanity as central to natural philosophy, in that humans are embodied spirits whose actions, chosen with free will, affect the world around them and each other. In emphasising free will and the actions of mankind Castel attempted to counter deterministic views of man and nature.[4]/nCastel considered that true science should focus on readily experienced and described phenomena. His emphasis on the description and analysis of the perceived world was consistent with analogic thinking and phenomenal explanation. Castel actively opposed the idea of a science based on experimental methods, instruments, speculation and theorising.[4]/nEarly on, Castel illustrated his optical theories with a proposal for a Clavecin pour les yeux (Ocular Harpsichord, 1725). A new series of articles, published in the Mercure de France in 1735, gave his idea wider currency.[7] In 1739 the German composer Telemann went to France to see Castel's Ocular Harpsichord for himself. He ended up composing several pieces for it, as well as writing a description of it.[8]/nThe ocular harpsichord had sixty small coloured glass panes, each with a curtain that opened when a key was struck. A second, improved model of the harpsichord was demonstrated for a small audience in December 1754. Pressing a key caused a small shaft to open, in turn allowing light to shine through a piece of stained glass.[9][10] Castel thought of colour-music as akin to the lost language of paradise, where all men spoke alike, and he claimed that thanks to his instrument's capacity to paint sounds, even a deaf listener could enjoy music.[11]/nIt was in 1740 that Louis Bertrand Castel published a criticism of Newton's spectral description of prismatic colour[12] in which he observed that the colours of white light split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism, and that Newton was looking at a special case. It was an argument that Goethe later developed in his Theory of Colours.[13][14]", "768762": "Sydney Chapman FRS (29 January 1888\u00a0\u2013 16 June 1970)[1] was a British mathematician and geophysicist.[4] His work on the kinetic theory of gases, solar-terrestrial physics, and the Earth's ozone layer has inspired a broad range of research over many decades.[2][5][6][7][8]/nChapman was born in Eccles, near Salford in England and began his advanced studies at a technical institute, now the University of Salford, in 1902.[9]  In 1904 at age 16, Chapman entered the University of Manchester.

Although he graduated with an engineering degree, Chapman had become so enthusiastic for mathematics that he stayed for one further year to take a mathematics degree. Following Lamb's suggestion, Chapman applied for a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was at first awarded only a partial scholarship as a sizar (meaning that he obtained financial support by acting as a servant to other students), but from his second year onwards he received a full scholarship. He graduated as a wrangler in 1910.[6] He began his research in pure mathematics under G. H. Hardy, but later that year was asked by Sir Frank Dyson to be his chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.[citation needed]/nFrom 1914 to 1919, Chapman returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics and a fellow of Trinity. He held the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at Manchester from 1919 to 1924, the same position as had been held by Lamb, and then moved to Imperial College London. During the Second World War he was Deputy Scientific Advisor to the Army Council.[6]/nIn 1946, Chapman was elected to the Sedleian Chair of Natural Philosophy at Oxford, and was appointed fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford. In 1953, on his retirement from Oxford, Chapman took research and teaching opportunities all over the world,[4] including at the University of Alaska and the University of Colorado, but also as far afield as Istanbul, Cairo, Prague, and Tokyo. As the Advisory Scientific Director of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute from 1951 to 1970, he spent three months of the year in Alaska, usually during winter for research into auroras.[10] Much of the remainder of the year he spent at the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado.[11]/nChapman's most noted mathematical accomplishments were in the field of stochastic processes (random processes), especially Markov processes. In his study of Markovian stochastic processes and their generalizations, Chapman and the Russian Andrey Kolmogorov independently developed the pivotal set of equations in the field, the Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equations. Chapman is credited with working out, in 1930, the photochemical mechanisms that give rise to the ozone layer.[11]/nChapman is recognised as one of the pioneers of solar-terrestrial physics.[4]  This interest stemmed from his early work on the kinetic theory of gases. Chapman studied magnetic storms and aurorae, developing theories to explain their relation to the interaction of the Earth's magnetic field with the solar wind. He disputed and ridiculed the work of Kristian Birkeland and Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, later adopting Birkeland's theories as his own.[12][13] Chapman and his first graduate student, V. C. A. Ferraro, predicted the presence of the magnetosphere in the early 1930s. They also predicted characteristics of the magnetosphere that were confirmed 30 years later by the Explorer 12 satellite.[5]/nIn 1940, Chapman and a German colleague Julius Bartels published a book in two volumes[14][15] on geomagnetism, which was to become the standard text book for the next two decades.[5]  In 1946 Chapman coined the term: Aeronomy, which is used today to describe the scientific field of high-altitude research into atmosphere/space interaction.[citation needed]/nFrom 1951 to 1954, Chapman was president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG).[citation needed]/nChapman was President of the Special Committee for the International Geophysical Year (IGY).  The idea of the IGY stemmed from a discussion in 1950 between Chapman and scientists including James Van Allen.   The IGY was held in 1957\u201358, and resulted in great progress in fields including Earth and space sciences, as well as leading to the first satellite launches.[citation needed]/nChapman was bestowed many honours over his career, including Smith's Prize in 1913,[6] election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1919,[1] Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1924,[16] Royal Society Bakerian lecturer in 1931, Royal Society Royal Medal in 1934, London Mathematical Society De Morgan Medal in 1944. In 1949, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1953. In 1964, he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society and in 1965 the Symons Gold Medal of the Royal Meteorological Society. He was elected to the National Academies of Science of the United States, Norway, Sweden and Finland.[6] He served as president of the London Mathematical Society during 1929\u20131931 and the Royal Meteorological Society 1932\u20131933.[citation needed]/nThe lunar Crater Chapman is named in his honour, as is the Sydney Chapman Building on the campus of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. This building served as the first permanent home of the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute, and it now contains the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.[17] The American Geophysical Union organises \"Chapman Conferences,\" which are small, topical meetings intended to foster innovative research in key areas.[18] The Royal Astronomical Society founded the Chapman Medal in his memory.[19]/nIn 1970, Chapman died in Boulder, Colorado, at the age of 82.[6]", "768770": "George Kingsley Zipf (/\u02c8z\u026af/;[1] January 7, 1902 \u2013 September 25, 1950), was an American linguist and philologist who studied statistical occurrences in different languages.[2]/nZipf earned his bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees from Harvard University, although he also studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin.[2] He was chairman of the German department and university lecturer (meaning he could teach any subject he chose) at Harvard University.[2] He worked with Chinese and demographics, and much of his effort can explain properties of the Internet, distribution of income within nations, and many other collections of data.[3]/nHe is the eponym of Zipf's law, which states that while only a few words are used very often, many or most are used rarely,/nwhere Pn is the frequency of a word ranked nth and the exponent a is almost 1.  This means that the second item occurs approximately 1/2 as often as the first, and the third item 1/3 as often as the first, and so on. Zipf's discovery of this law in 1935 was one of the first academic studies of word frequency.[4]/nAlthough he originally intended it as a model for linguistics, Zipf later generalized his law to other disciplines. In particular, he observed that the rank vs. frequency distribution of individual incomes in a unified nation approximates this law, and in his 1941 book, \"National Unity and Disunity\" he theorized that breaks in this \"normal curve of income distribution\" portend social pressure for change or revolution.[citation needed]", "40614663": "Georg Feigl (13 October 1890 \u2013 20 April 1945) was a German mathematician./nGeorg Feigl started studying mathematics and physics at the University of Jena in 1909.

In 1935 he became a full professor at the University of Breslau. In 1937\u20141941, he was an editor of the journal Deutsche Mathematik./nFeigl's main areas of work were the foundations of geometry and topology, where he studied fixed point theorems for n-dimensional manifolds./nFeigl was one of the initial authors of the Mathematisches W\u00f6rterbuch (\"Mathematical dictionary\"). Because of the impending siege by the Red Army he was forced to leave Breslau in January 1945 with his family and other members of the Mathematical Institute. His wife Maria was distantly related to the lord of the manor of Wechselburg castle and prepared the castle to receive the mathematicians. Feigl brought his previously developed materials for the Mathematisches W\u00f6rterbuch and asked his students to further refine it in the castle. They did not have access to books, lecture notes, calculators, or typewriters in the castle. Johann Radon (1887\u20131956) and Feigl were willing and able to continue lectures started in Breslau for one hour a day at Wechselburg castle, without any documents. Feigl had a severe stomach ailment and died after a few months without medication in Wechselburg.

In 1867 he was naturalized in Basel. He was also a statistician, he founded the Swiss Statistical Society and the Statistical-economic society in Basel and led the 1870 and 1880 Federal census in Basel./nKinkelin's works dealt with the gamma function, infinite series, and solid geometry of the axonometric.

He made a fundamental contribution to the n-body problem in celestial mechanics by proving that using a third degree approximation for the disturbing forces implies instability of the major axes of the orbits, and by introducing the concept of secular perturbations in relation to this./nAs a politician, during his three terms as Minister of Education, Haret ran deep reforms, building the modern Romanian education system. He was made a full member of the Romanian Academy in 1892./nHe also founded the Bucharest Observatory, appointing Nicolae Coculescu\u00a0[ro] as its first director. The crater Haret on the Moon is named after him./nHaret was born in Ia\u0219i, Moldavia, to Constantin and Smaranda Haret,[1] who were of Armenian origin.[2] His baptismal record listed his name as Spiridon Haret.[1] He started his studies in Dorohoi Ia\u0219i, and in 1862 moved to Saint Sava High School in Bucharest.[3] He showed an early talent for mathematics, publishing two textbooks (one in algebra and one in trigonometry) when he was still a high school student. In 1869 he entered the University of Bucharest, where he studied physics and mathematics. In 1870, while a student in his second term, he became teacher of mathematics at the Nifon Seminary in Bucharest, but quit the following year in order to continue his studies. In 1874, at age 23, he graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics./nAfter graduation, Haret won a scholarship competition organized by Titu Maiorescu and went to Paris in order to study mathematics at the Sorbonne. There he earned a mathematics diploma in 1875 and a physics diploma in 1876. Two years later (on 18 January 1878), he earned his Ph.D. by defending his thesis, Sur l\u2019invariabilit\u00e9 des grandes axes des orbites plan\u00e9taires (On the invariability of the major axis of planetary orbits),[4] in front of examiners led by Victor Puiseux, his Ph.D. advisor.[5] In this work he proved a result fundamental for the n-body problem in astronomy, the thesis being published in volume 18 of Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris. Haret was the first Romanian to obtain a Ph.D. degree in Paris./nAfter his return to Romania in 1878, Haret largely abandoned scientific research and dedicated the rest of his life to improving Romanian education, which was heavily underdeveloped at the time, both as professor and as politician. He was appointed professor of rational mechanics at the Faculty of Science of the University of Bucharest.[4] The next year (1879), Haret became a correspondent member of the Romanian Academy, receiving full membership in 1892. He kept the professorship at the Faculty of Science until his retirement in 1910, when he was followed as professor of mechanics by Dimitrie Pompeiu. From 1882 he was also a professor of analytical geometry at the School of Bridges and Roads in Bucharest. After retirement, Haret occasionally lectured at the informal People's University./nHaret was the Minister of Public Education in three liberal governments, between 1897 and 1899, 1901\u20131904, and 1907\u20131910. As Minister of Education he ran a complete reform, basically building the modern Romanian education system./nThe folk song \"C\u00e2nt\u0103 cucu-n Bucovina\" (\"Sings the Cuckoo in Bukovina\") was composed in 1904 by Constantin Mandicevschi\u00a0[de; ru; uk] at Haret's request for commemorating the 400th anniversary of the death of Prince of Moldavia Stephen the Great.[6]/nIn January 1883, he married in Buz\u0103u a local, Ana Popescu, 15 years his junior. The two had a son, Ion, who died at age 1, and later adopted a child, Mihai. Haret died in Bucharest in 1912 of cancer, and was buried in the city's Bellu Cemetery; Ana Haret died in 1941, aged 74.[1]/nHaret's major scientific contribution was made in 1878, in his Ph.D. thesis Sur l\u2019invariabilit\u00e9 des grandes axes des orbites plan\u00e9taires. At the time it was known that planets disturb each other's orbits, thus deviating from the elliptic motion described by Johannes Kepler\u2019s First Law. Pierre Laplace (in 1773) and Joseph Louis Lagrange (in 1776) had already studied the problem, both of them showing that the major axes of the orbits are stable, by using a first degree approximation of the perturbing forces. In 1808 Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson had proved that the stability also holds when using second degree approximations. In his thesis, Haret proved by using third degree approximations that the axes are not stable as previously believed, but instead feature a time variability, which he called secular perturbations. This result implies that planetary motion is not absolutely stable. Henri Poincar\u00e9 considered this result a great surprise and continued Haret\u2019s research, which eventually led him to the creation of chaos theory. Haret established the instability of the model of the n-body problem assuming frequencies to be incommensurable; Poincar\u00e9 also took into account commensurabilities, and using generalized Fourier series (which generate quasi-periodic solutions), he proved the divergence of these series (which means instability), thus confirming Haret\u2019s result.[7] F\u00e9lix Tisserand recommended the extension of Haret's method to other astronomic problems and, much later, in 1955, Jean Meffroy restarted Haret\u2019s research using new techniques.[8]/nSoon after his return to Romania, Haret abandoned research, focusing for the rest of his life on teaching and, as Minister of Education, on the reform of the education system. He only published an article on the secular acceleration of the Moon in 1880 and one on Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot (1912).[4]/nIn 1910 he published Social mechanics, which used mathematics to explain social behaviour (somehow anticipating the fictional \"psychohistory\" branch of mathematics developed by Hari Seldon, the fictional character of Isaac Asimov's Foundation, published 40 years later).", "61750027": "Ignace Robert Dautray, born Kouchelevitz on 1 February 1928 in the 10th arrondissement of Paris,[1] is a French engineer, former scientific director of the French Commissariat \u00e0 l'Energie Atomique (CEA) and former High Commissioner for Atomic Energy.

Fedorov, which reproduced Fet's own initials and sometimes under the names of real people who agreed to publish Fet's translations under their names./nAbram Fet was born on 5 December 1924 in Odesa into a family of Ilya Fet and Revekka Nikolayevskaya. Ilya Fet was a medical doctor; he was born and grew in Rivne and studied medicine in Paris. Revekka was a housewife; she grew in Odesa. Fet's father often changed jobs, moving with his family over Ukraine looking for places where to escape starvation, and the children had to change schools. In 1936, the family settled in Odesa. There Abram Fet finished high school at the age of 15 and entered the Odesa Institute of Communications Engineering. He had hardly finished the first year when the Second World War broke out. Fet's family was evacuated to Siberia, to the Tomsk region. In 1941, Fet entered the Mathematics Department of Tomsk University, where he was admitted to the second year of studies. At that time, many professors evacuated from European Russia were teaching at the local university, among them Petr Rashchevsky who advised him in 1946 to continue his education in Moscow University. There Fet attended the seminars of Gelfand, Pontryagin, and Novikov and started to specialize in topology on advice of Vilenkin, under supervision of Lazar Lusternik./nIn December 1948, Fet defended his Candidate Thesis named \"A Homology Ring of Closed Curve Space on a Sphere\", which was recognized as an outstanding contribution by the mathematicians of Moscow University. After graduation, he started working in Tomsk University as a junior lecturer and then an associate professor of the Calculus Department. Among others, he taught V. Toponogov and S. Alber. Beginning from 1955, Fet worked in various colleges of Novosibirsk. In 1960, he got employed as a senior researcher in the Ceometry and Topology Department of the newly established Institute of Mathematics of the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. At the same time, he also taught at the new Novosibirsk University./nIn November 1967, he defended a doctorate at Moscow University named \"A Periodic Problem of Variational Calculus\", focused around Fet's theorem about two closed geodesic arcs, which became classical./nIn 1968, Fet signed the \"Letter of 46\" in defense of imprisoned dissidents, which became the reason for his dismissal both from the research institute and from the university. The real reason, though, was not the very fact of signing the letter but his independent character and straightforwardness with which he spoke about the professional and human qualities of his co-workers, about the intrigues of functionaries in science and about the privileges in Academgorodok (a limited-access grocery shop for residents, a special medical center and other privileges for the science town management and for doctors of sciences and their families).\nDuring four years, from October 1968 to June 1972, Fet was unemployed, earning his living by doing technical translations and translating mathematical books from different languages, which his friends arranged for him, and continued his research./nBack in 1965, Fet began working together with Yu. B. Rumer, a Soviet physicist. The two monographs became the result of their joint work: \"The Theory of Unitary Symmetry\" (published in Moscow in 1970) and \"The Theory of Groups and Quantum Fields\" (Moscow, 1977), as well as a number of papers, including \"Group Spin-(4) and the Periodic Table\" (\"Theoretical and Mathematical Physics\", v. 9, 1971). This paper began group description of the system of chemical elements. In 1972, A.I. Fet was employed as a senior researcher at the theoretical physics laboratory of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry thanks to its director A. V. Nikolayev. During the subsequent ten years, A.I. Fet developed the ideas of group classification of atoms in a number of publications, which by the beginning of the 1980s he summed up in his monograph \"A Symmetry Group of Chemical Elements\". As a result, the entire field of chemistry related to the Periodic Table became part of mathematical physics. In 1984, this monograph was prepared by the Siberian branch of the Nauka Publishing House for publication but suddenly the manuscript was withdrawn from print, and the type matter was decomposed. The reason why it was done became clear soon: on 8 October 1986 Fet was dismissed from work \"due to noncompliance with the position held based on the performance evaluation.\" Again he continued to do science on his own, earning a living by casual translations./nNot less than being a pure scientist, Abram Fet was a thinker. According to his philosophy, it is the man that is the end goal of any culture, a man with a harmonious personality, lofty ideals, and noble aspirations. And it is intelligentsia that has the mission of enlightening the society, though under conditions of harsh censorship./nBack in the 1960s, Fet took part in  \"Samizdat\" publishing by translating books for Samizdat. Fet introduced the Russian reader to the main works by Konrad Lorenz, whose ideas made a significant impact on his own thinking: Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins (Die acht Tods\u00fcnden der zivilisierten Menschheit, 1974), On Aggression (Das sogenannte B\u00f6se.

Later those translations were published openly by Respublika Publishing House in Moscow (Behind the Mirror, and On Aggression, 1998); another edition was published in 2008 with Kulturnaya Revolutsia Publishing House (Moscow)./nFet was the first to translate and introduce many books on psychology for Samizdat which failed to pass the censorship in the USSR of the time: Eric Berne, Games People Play, 1964, The Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis, 1959, Sex in Human Loving, 1970; Erich Fromm Escape from Freedom (Die Furcht vor der Freiheit, 1941); Karen Horney, The Neurotic Personality of our Time, 1937, and many others./nTo introduce the reader to various kinds of society organization, Fet translated books for Samizdat from the series of pocket ABC books published in Warsaw and disclosing the basics of social and economic organization in different countries: The ABC of Stockholm, The ABC of Vienna, The ABC of Bern. These translations were complemented by Fet's own articles: Social Doctrines (1979) and What is Socialism? (1989)./nBeginning with the mid-1970s, Fet closely followed the events which took place in Poland. He perceived the Polish crisis of 1980\u22121981 as the start of collapse of the so-called Socialist camp. His book The Polish Revolution written in the wake of the events was anonymously published in 1985 in Paris and in London, with a foreword of Mario Corti. He provided an analysis of the Polish events, disclosed their historic prerequisites, demonstrated the outstanding role of the Polish intellectuals, and foretold the ways of further development for the country./nFet wrote most of his humanitarian articles for Samizdat, as they could not appear in the censored Soviet periodicals. In the 1980s, the Russian emigree journal in Paris called Syntax published six articles by Fet signed with the pseudonym A.N. Klenov, which he later used for other writings on social issues./nThroughout his life, Fet was thinking on the human society, on the biological and cultural nature of man, on the social mission of the intelligentsia, on religious beliefs and ideals. These reflections resulted in his books Pythagoras and the Ape (1989), Letters from Russia (1989\u20131991), Delusions of Capitalism, or the Fatal Conceit of Professor Hayek (1996), the main work being Instinct and Social Behavior, published in 2009. This book is dedicated to the history of culture presented from the viewpoint of ethology. The author set a goal \"to reveal the impact of the social instinct on the human socety, to describe the conditions frustrating its manifestations and to explain the effects of various attempts to suppress this invincible instinct\". Fet discovered and first described a kind of social instinct specific to humans, which he called \"the instinct of intraspecific solidarity\". Its specificity consists in the ability of being spread from minor groups to larger ones. Using comprehensive historic examples, the author has convincingly demonstrated how our morals and our love for our neighbors originated from tribal solidarity, which gradually became transformed into intraspecific solidarity, thus spreading the mark of kinship to ever wider communities, eventually to be referred to the entire mankind./nFet's main areas of interest in mathematics are variational calculus and topology, including applications to geometry and calculus.\nThe best known are Fet's classical theorems on closed geodesic arcs:\nThe theorem of Lyusternik and Fet states that there exists at least one closed geodesic arc in any compact Riemann manifold.\nThis result obtained by Lyusternik and Fet in 1951 was improved only in 1965, when Fet proved the theorem of two closed geodesic arcs.\nFet's theorem states the existence of at least two non-recurrent closed geodesic arcs under the assumption that all closed geodesic arcs are non-degenerate. The result of 1965 has not yet been improved./nFet worked in the field of symmetry physics and the theory of elementary particles. Beginning with the early 1970s, he worked at physical substantiation of the system of chemical elements. He was the first to describe the logic of atomic weights previously considered unpredictable and developed the formula of atomic weight./nFet's works on social issues, philosophy, history, and his translations are available here in Russian.", "41171782": "Colin John Bushnell (1947 \u2013 1 January 2021) was a British mathematician specialising in number theory and representation theory.

Although there is disagreement on the subject, Pandrosion is believed by many current scholars to have been female. If so, she would be an earlier female contributor to mathematics than Hypatia./nPandrosion is credited with developing a method for calculating numerically accurate but approximate solutions to the problem of doubling the cube, or more generally of calculating cube roots. It is a \"recursive geometric\" solution, but three-dimensional rather than working within the plane.[1] Pappus criticized this work as lacking a proper mathematical proof.[1][2][3] Although Pappus does not directly state that the method is Pandrosion's, he includes it in a section of his Collection dedicated to correcting what he perceives as errors in Pandrosion's students.[1][3] Another method included in the same section, and attributable in the same way indirectly to Pandrosion, is a correct and exact method for constructing the geometric mean, simpler than the method used by Pappus.[1][4]/nWhen Friedrich Hultsch prepared his 1878 translation of Pappus's Collection from Greek into Latin, the manuscript of the Collection that he used referred to Pandrosion using a feminine form of address. Hultsch decided that this must have been a mistake, and referred to Pandrosion as masculine in his translation; many later scholars have followed suit.[2][5] However, the 1988 English translation of Pappus by Alexander Raymond Jones \"argued convincingly\" that the original feminine form was not a mistake,[1] and more recent scholarship has followed Jones in taking the position that Pandrosion was a woman.[3][6][7][8]/nHypatia has often been called the first woman to have contributed to mathematics, but Pappus died before the earliest suggested birth date of Hypatia. Therefore, Pandrosion is a likely candidate for an earlier female contributor to mathematics than Hypatia.[2] Pandrosion was also described by Pappus as a teacher of mathematics, and although Pappus recorded only men among her students, Edward J.

Subsequently, he served during the Mexican\u2013American War, being brevetted successively to captain and major for gallantry in a number of important battles, including the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma.

Wright wanted an experienced Regular Army officer in that post, rather than a volunteer, since the District was large (encompassing the present-day states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho), underdeveloped, and had a history of friction between the native peoples and settlers. As commander of the District, Alvord built up the defenses around the mouth of the Columbia River, but was unable to do the same for Puget Sound. Because of low enlistments from Oregon and Washington, he supported the military draft, and failing that, supported the payment of bounties.

In 1967, a similar result was published by Lloyd Shapley. Having learned about the publication of Bondareva, Shapley unconditionally recognized its priority, which ensured its universal recognition./nThis theorem uses the notion of a balanced coverage, some analog of partition of unity in topology. This is the name of a set of non-negative numbers assigned to each coalition if their summation over all coalitions, including one (any) player, gives one. The Bondareva\u2013Shapley theorem states that the core is non-empty if and only if, for any balanced covering, the sum over all coalitions of the values of the characteristic function with the corresponding weights does not exceed the value of the characteristic function for the complete coalition. With a small number of players, this theorem allows us to practically deal with any game to the end. In addition, it makes it possible to establish that the core is non-empty in some classes of games, regardless of the number of players, for example, in convex games./nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Bondareva studied game-theoretic dominance properties expressed in terms of abstract binary relations, essentially following the example of the seminal monograph  Neumann and  Morgenstern. In particular, she obtained a number of results on the convergence of spaces with a binary relation and on finite approximations.\nShe was also among the first to publish a theorem on the existence of a maximum element for an acyclic binary relation with open lower contours on a compact set, although her note, published in Russian in the proceedings of the conference (in Vilniuse), went unnoticed./nIn the late 1970s, Bondareva, together with her students T. E. Kulakovskaya and N. I. Naumova, brainstormed the problem of the existence of a  von Neumann-Morgenstern solution in cooperative games with transferable utility (the possibility of non-existence was already known by that time ).

His philosophical works and a drama that he co-wrote, however, received little attention./nEmanuel Lasker was born on December 24, 1868, at Berlinchen in Neumark (now Barlinek in Poland), the son of a Jewish cantor. At the age of eleven he was sent to study mathematics in Berlin, where he lived with his brother Berthold, eight years his senior, who taught him how to play chess. Berthold was among the world's top ten players in the early 1890s.[2] To supplement their income, Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes, especially at the Caf\u00e9 Kaiserhof.[3][4]/nLasker won the Caf\u00e9 Kaiserhof's annual Winter tournament 1888/89 and the Hauptturnier A (\"second division\" tournament) at the sixth DSB Congress (German Chess Federation's congress), held in Breslau. Winning the Hauptturnier earned Lasker the title of \"master\". The candidates were divided into two groups of ten. The top four in each group competed in a final. Lasker won his section, with 2\u00bd points more than his nearest rival. However, scores were reset to 0 for the final. With two rounds to go, Lasker trailed the leader, Viennese amateur von Feierfeil, by 1\u00bd points. Lasker won both of his final games, while von Feierfeil lost in the penultimate round (being mated in 121 moves after the position was reconstructed incorrectly following an adjournment) and drew in the last round. The two players were now tied. Lasker won a playoff and garnered the master title. This enabled him to play in master-level tournaments and thus launched his chess career.[5]/nLasker finished second in an international tournament at Amsterdam, ahead of Mason and Gunsberg.[6]:\u200a5\u200a[7] In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing a game.[8][9] At New York City in 1893, he won all thirteen games,[10][11][12] one of the few times in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.[13][14][15]/nHis record in matches was equally impressive: At Berlin in 1890 he drew a short playoff match against his brother Berthold and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben (1889), Jacques Mieses (1889), Henry Edward Bird (1890), Berthold Englisch (1890), Joseph Henry Blackburne (1892), Jackson Showalter (1892\u201393) and Celso Golmayo Z\u00fapide (1893).[16][17]/nIn 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines, The London Chess Fortnightly, which was published from August 15, 1892, to July 30, 1893. In the second quarter of 1893, there was a gap of ten weeks between issues, allegedly because of problems with the printer.[18] Shortly after its last issue, Lasker traveled to the US, where he spent the next two years.[19]/nLasker challenged Siegbert Tarrasch, who had won three consecutive strong international tournaments (Breslau 1889, Manchester 1890, and Dresden 1892), to a match. Tarrasch haughtily declined, stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international events.[20]/nRebuffed by Tarrasch, Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, to a match for the title.[20] Initially Lasker wanted to play for US$5,000 a side, and a match was agreed to at stakes of $3,000 a side, but Steinitz agreed to a series of reductions when Lasker found it difficult to raise the money. The final figure was $2,000, which was less than for some of Steinitz's earlier matches (the final combined stake of $4,000 would be worth over $495,000 at 2006 values[21]). The match was played in 1894 at venues in New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt, so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game. Steinitz won the second game and maintained the balance through the sixth. However, Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh, and Steinitz asked for a week's rest. When the match resumed, Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games. Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th, and Steinitz did not compensate for his losses in the middle of the match. Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins, five losses, and four draws.[22][23][24] On May 26, Lasker thus became the second formally recognized World Chess Champion and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their rematch in 1896\u201397 (ten wins, two losses, and five draws).[16][25]/nInfluential players and journalists belittled the 1894 match both before and after it took place. Lasker's difficulty in getting backing may have been caused by hostile pre-match comments from Gunsberg and Leopold Hoffer,[12] who had long been a bitter enemy of Steinitz.[26] One of the complaints was that Lasker had never played the other two members of the top four, Siegbert Tarrasch and Mikhail Chigorin[12] \u2013 although Tarrasch had rejected a challenge from Lasker in 1892, publicly telling him to go and win an international tournament first.[18][27] After the match some commentators, notably Tarrasch, said Lasker had won mainly because Steinitz was old (58 in 1894).[3][28]/nEmanuel Lasker answered these criticisms by creating an even more impressive playing record. He came third at Hastings 1895 (where he may have been suffering from the after-effects of typhoid fever[3]), behind Pillsbury and Chigorin but ahead of Tarrasch and Steinitz, and then won first prizes at very strong tournaments in St\u00a0Petersburg 1895\u201396 (an elite, 4-player tournament, ahead of Steinitz, Pillsbury and Chigorin), Nuremberg (1896), London (1899) and Paris (1900); tied for second at Cambridge Springs 1904, and tied for first at the Chigorin Memorial in St\u00a0Petersburg 1909.[4]/nLater, at St\u00a0Petersburg\u00a0(1914), he overcame a 1\u00bd-point deficit to finish ahead of the rising stars, Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine, who later became the next two World Champions.[10][17][29][30][31] For decades chess writers have reported that Tsar Nicholas II of Russia conferred the title of Grandmaster of Chess upon each of the five finalists at St\u00a0Petersburg 1914 (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall), but chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources supporting this story were published in 1940 and 1942.[32][33][34]/nLasker's match record was as impressive between his 1896\u201397 rematch with Steinitz and 1914: he won all but one of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing defenses of his title./nIn 1906 Lasker and G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy  agreed to terms for a World Championship, but the arrangements could not be finalised, and the match never took place.[35]/nLasker's first world championship match since 1897 was against Frank Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907. Despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11\u00bd\u20133\u00bd).[36]/nLasker then played Tarrasch in the World Chess Championship 1908, first at D\u00fcsseldorf then at Munich. Tarrasch firmly believed the game of chess was governed by a precise set of principles.[36] For him the strength of a chess move was in its logic, not in its efficiency. Because of his stubborn principles he considered Lasker as a coffeehouse player who won his games only thanks to dubious tricks, while Lasker mocked the arrogance of Tarrasch who, in his opinion, shone more in salons than at the chessboard. At the opening ceremony, Tarrasch refused to talk to Lasker, only saying: \"Mr. Lasker, I have only three words to say to you: check and mate!\"[37][38]/nLasker gave a brilliant answer on the chessboard, winning four of the first five games, and playing a type of chess Tarrasch could not understand. For example, in the second game after 19 moves arose a situation (diagram) in which Lasker was a pawn down, with a bad bishop and doubled pawns. At this point it appeared Tarrasch was winning, but 20 moves later he was forced to resign.[40] Lasker eventually won by 10\u00bd\u20135\u00bd (eight wins, five draws, and three losses). Tarrasch claimed the wet weather was the cause of his defeat.[40]/nIn 1909 Lasker drew a short match (two wins, two losses) against Dawid Janowski, an all-out attacking Polish expatriate. Several months later they played a longer match in Paris, and chess historians still debate whether this was for the World Chess Championship.[41] Understanding Janowski's style, Lasker chose to defend solidly so that Janowski unleashed his attacks too soon and left himself vulnerable. Lasker easily won the match 8\u20132 (seven wins, two draws, one loss).[42] This victory was convincing for everyone but Janowski, who asked for a revenge match. Lasker accepted and they played a World Chess Championship match in Berlin in November\u2013December 1910. Lasker crushed his opponent, winning 9\u00bd\u20131\u00bd (eight wins, three draws, no losses).[43] Janowski did not understand Lasker's moves, and after his first three losses he declared to Edward Lasker, \"Your homonym plays so stupidly that I cannot even look at the chessboard when he thinks. I am afraid I will not do anything good in this match.\"[42]/nBetween his two matches against Janowski, Lasker arranged another World Chess Championship in January\u2013February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was a modest gentleman, who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw).[44]/nAt the beginning, Lasker tried to attack but Schlechter had no difficulty defending, so that the first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at the middle of the match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5\u20134 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing.[45] Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion./nIt has been speculated that Schlechter played unusually risky chess in the tenth game because the terms of the match required him to win by a margin of two games.  But according to Isaak and Vladimir Linder, this was unlikely. The match was originally to be a 30-game affair and Schlechter would have to win by two games. But they note that according to the Austrian chess historian Michael Ehn, Lasker agreed to forgo the plus two provision in view of the match being subsequently reduced to only 10 games. For proof Ehn quoted Schlechter's comment printed in Allgemeine Sportzeitung (ASZ) of December 9, 1909 \"There will be ten games in all. The winner on points will receive the title of world champion. If the points are equal, the decision will be made by the arbiter.\"\n[46]/nIn 1911 Lasker received a challenge for a world title match against the rising star Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca. Lasker was unwilling to play the traditional \"first to win ten games\" type of match in the semi-tropical conditions of Havana, especially as drawn games were becoming more frequent and the match might last for over six months. He therefore made a counter-proposal: if neither player had a lead of at least two games by the end of the match, it should be considered a draw; the match should be limited to the best of thirty games, counting draws; except that if either player won six games and led by at least two games before thirty games were completed, he should be declared the winner; the champion should decide the venue and stakes, and should have the exclusive right to publish the games; the challenger should deposit a forfeit of US$2,000 (equivalent to over $250,000 in 2020 values[47]); the time limit should be twelve moves per hour; play should be limited to two sessions of 2\u00bd hours each per day, five days a week. Capablanca objected to the time limit, the short playing times, the thirty-game limit, and especially the requirement that he must win by two games to claim the title, which he regarded as unfair. Lasker took offence at the terms in which Capablanca criticized the two-game lead condition and broke off negotiations, and until 1914 Lasker and Capablanca were not on speaking terms. However, at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, Capablanca proposed a set of rules for the conduct of World Championship matches, which were accepted by all the leading players, including Lasker.[48]/nLate in 1912 Lasker entered into negotiations for a world title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years had been on a par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's.[49] The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never played. This situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.[50][51]\nThroughout World War I (1914\u20131918) Lasker played in only two serious chess events. He convincingly won (5\u00bd\u2212\u00bd) a non-title match against Tarrasch in 1916.[52] In September\u2013October 1918, shortly before the armistice, he won a quadrangular (four-player) tournament, half a point ahead of Rubinstein.[53]/nDespite his superb playing results, chess was not Lasker's only interest. His parents recognized his intellectual talents, especially for mathematics, and sent the adolescent Emanuel to study in Berlin (where he found he also had a talent for chess). Lasker gained his abitur (high school graduation certificate) at Landsberg an der Warthe, now a Polish town named Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski but then part of Prussia. He then studied mathematics and philosophy at the universities in Berlin, G\u00f6ttingen (where David Hilbert was one of his doctoral advisors) and Heidelberg.[54]/nIn 1895 he published two mathematical articles in Nature.[55] On the advice of David Hilbert he registered for doctoral studies at Erlangen during 1900\u20131902.[54] In 1901 he presented his doctoral thesis \u00dcber Reihen auf der Convergenzgrenze (\"On Series at Convergence Boundaries\") at Erlangen and in the same year it was published by the Royal Society.[56][57] He was awarded a doctorate in mathematics in 1902.[54] His most significant mathematical article, in 1905, published a theorem on primary decompositions of which Emmy Noether developed a more generalized form, which is now regarded as of fundamental importance to modern algebra and algebraic geometry.[58][54]/nLasker held short-term positions as a mathematics lecturer at Tulane University in New Orleans (1893) and Victoria University in Manchester (1901; Victoria University was one of the \"parents\" of the current University of Manchester).[54] However, he was unable to secure a longer-term position, and pursued his scholarly interests independently.[59]/nIn 1906 Lasker published a booklet titled Kampf (Struggle),[60] in which he attempted to create a general theory of all competitive activities, including chess, business and war. He produced two other books which are generally categorized as philosophy, Das Begreifen der Welt (Comprehending the World; 1913) and Die Philosophie des Unvollendbar (sic; The Philosophy of the Unattainable; 1918).[54]/nIn 1896\u201397 Lasker published his book Common Sense in Chess, based on lectures he had given in London in 1895.[61]/nIn 1903, Lasker played in Ostend against Mikhail Chigorin, a six-game match that was sponsored by the wealthy lawyer and industrialist Isaac Rice in order to test the Rice Gambit.[62] Lasker narrowly lost the match. Three years later Lasker became secretary of the Rice Gambit Association, founded by Rice in order to promote the Rice Gambit,[19] and in 1907 Lasker quoted with approval Rice's views on the convergence of chess and military strategy.[63]/nIn November 1904, Lasker founded Lasker's Chess Magazine, which ran until 1909.[64]/nBeginning in 1910, he wrote a weekly chess column for the New York Evening Post, for which he was Chess Editor.[65]/nEmanuel Lasker became interested in the strategy game Go after being introduced to it by his namesake Edward Lasker, probably in 1907 or 1908 (Edward Lasker wrote a successful book Go and Go-Moku in 1934[66]). He and Edward played Go together while Edward was helping him prepare for his 1908 match with Tarrasch. He kept his interest in Go for the rest of his life, becoming one of the strongest players in Germany and Europe and contributing occasionally to the magazine Deutsche Go-Zeitung. It is alleged that he once said \"Had I discovered Go sooner, I would probably have never become world chess champion\".[67]/nAt the age of 42, in July 1911, Lasker married Martha Cohn (n\u00e9e Bamberger), a rich widow who was a year older than Lasker and already a grandmother. They lived in Berlin.[19][68][69] Martha Cohn wrote popular stories under the pseudonym \"L. Marco\".[59][70]/nDuring World War I, Lasker invested all of his savings in German war bonds, which lost nearly their entire value with the wartime and post-war inflation. During the war, he wrote a pamphlet which claimed that civilization would be in danger if Germany lost the war.[19]/nIn January 1920 Lasker and Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921, noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920. Because of the delay, Lasker insisted on a final clause that allowed him to play anyone else for the championship in 1920, that nullified the contract with Capablanca if Lasker lost a title match in 1920, and that stipulated that if Lasker resigned the title Capablanca should become World Champion. Lasker had previously included in his agreement before World War I to play Akiba Rubinstein for the title a similar clause that if he resigned the title, it should become Rubinstein's.[71]/nA report in the American Chess Bulletin (July\u2013August 1920 issue) said that Lasker had resigned the world title in favor of Capablanca because the conditions of the match were unpopular in the chess world. The American Chess Bulletin speculated that the conditions were not sufficiently unpopular to warrant resignation of the title, and that Lasker's real concern was that there was not enough financial backing to justify his devoting nine months to the match.[71] When Lasker resigned the title in favor of Capablanca he was unaware that enthusiasts in Havana had just raised $20,000 to fund the match provided it was played there. When Capablanca learned of Lasker's resignation he went to the Netherlands, where Lasker was living at the time, to inform him that Havana would finance the match. In August 1920 Lasker agreed to play in Havana, but insisted that he was the challenger as Capablanca was now the champion. Capablanca signed an agreement that accepted this point, and soon afterwards published a letter confirming this. Lasker also stated that, if he beat Capablanca, he would resign the title so that younger masters could compete for it.[71]/nThe match was played in March\u2013April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca's solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games, without taking any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a position with an Isolated Queen Pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.[72]/nReuben Fine and Harry Golombek attributed this to Lasker's being in mysteriously poor form.[4][73] On the other hand, Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an \"even and fascinating fight\" until Lasker blundered in the last game, and explained that Capablanca was 20 years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.[74]/nLasker was in his early 50s when he lost the world championship to Capablanca, and he retired from serious match play afterwards;[52][75] his only other match was a short exhibition against Frank James Marshall in 1940, which was never completed due to Lasker's illness and subsequent death a few months after it started.[6]:\u200a311\u200a After winning the Moravsk\u00e1 Ostrava 1923 chess tournament (without a single loss) and the New York 1924 chess tournament (1\u00bd points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1\u00bd points behind Efim Bogoljubow, \u00bd point ahead of Capablanca),[76] he effectively retired from serious chess.[4]/nDuring the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, Lasker received a telegram informing him that the drama written by himself and his brother Berthold, Vom Menschen die Geschichte\u00a0[de] (\"History of Mankind\"), had been accepted for performance at the Lessing theatre in Berlin. Lasker was so distracted by this news that he lost badly to Carlos Torre the same day.[77] The play, however, was not a success.[59]/nIn 1926, Lasker wrote Lehrbuch des Schachspiels, which he re-wrote in English in 1927 as Lasker's Manual of Chess.[78] He also wrote books on other games of mental skill: Encyclopedia of Games (1929) and Das verst\u00e4ndige Kartenspiel (means \"Sensible Card Play\"; 1929; English translation in the same year), both of which posed a problem in the mathematical analysis of card games;[79] Brettspiele der V\u00f6lker (\"Board Games of the Nations\"; 1931), which includes 30 pages about Go and a section about a game he had invented in 1911, Lasca.[80]/nIn 1930, Lasker was a special correspondent for Dutch and German newspapers[81] reporting on the Culbertson-Buller bridge match during which he became a registered teacher of the Culbertson system.[81] He became an expert bridge player,[1] representing Germany at international events in the early 1930s,[19][23] and wrote Das Bridgespiel (\"The Game of Bridge\") in 1931.[82]/nIn October 1928 Emanuel Lasker's brother Berthold died.[19][83]/nIn spring 1933 Adolf Hitler started a campaign of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same year.[84][85] After a short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited to live in the USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who had been responsible for Show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess.[59] In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship.[86] He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics[59] and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.[87]\nLasker returned to competitive chess to make some money, finishing fifth in Z\u00fcrich 1934 and third in Moscow 1935 (undefeated, \u00bd point behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr; ahead of Capablanca, Rudolf Spielmann and several Soviet masters), sixth in Moscow 1936 and equal seventh in Nottingham 1936.[88] His performance in Moscow 1935 at age 66 was hailed as \"a biological miracle\".[89]/nIn August 1937, Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union, and they moved, via the Netherlands, to the United States (first Chicago, next New York) in October 1937.[90] They were visiting Martha's daughter, but they may also have been motivated by political upheaval in the Soviet Union.[91] In the United States Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions, as he was now too old for serious competition.[19][59] In 1940 he published his last book, The Community of the Future, in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems, including anti-Semitism and unemployment.[59]/nLasker was considered to have a \"psychological\" method of play in which he considered the subjective qualities of his opponent, in addition to the objective requirements of his position on the board. Richard R\u00e9ti published a lengthy analysis of Lasker's play in which he concluded that Lasker deliberately played inferior moves that he knew would make his opponent uncomfortable.[92] W. H. K. Pollock commented, \"It is no easy matter to reply correctly to Lasker's bad moves.\"[93]/nLasker himself denied the claim that he deliberately played bad moves, and most modern writers agree. According to Grandmaster Andrew Soltis and International Master John L. Watson, the features that made his play mysterious to contemporaries now appear regularly in modern play: the g2\u2013g4 \"Spike\" attack against the Dragon Sicilian;[citation needed] sacrifices to gain positional advantage; playing the \"practical\" move rather than trying to find the best move; counterattacking and complicating the game before a disadvantage became serious.[94][95] Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik said, \"He realized that different types of advantage could be interchangeable: tactical edge could be converted into strategic advantage and vice versa\", which mystified contemporaries who were just becoming used to the theories of Steinitz as codified by Siegbert Tarrasch.[74]/nMax Euwe opined that the real reason behind Lasker's success was his \"exceptional defensive technique\" and that \"almost all there is to say about defensive chess can be demonstrated by examples from the games of Steinitz and Lasker\", the former exemplifying passive defence and the latter an active defence.[96]/nThe famous win against Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca at St. Petersburg in 1914, which Lasker needed in order to retain any chance of catching up with Capablanca, is sometimes offered as evidence of his \"psychological\" approach. Reuben Fine describes Lasker's choice of opening, the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, as \"innocuous but psychologically potent\".[4] Lud\u011bk Pachman writes that Lasker's choice presented his opponent with a dilemma: with only a \u00bd\u00a0point lead, Capablanca would have wanted to play safe; but the Exchange Variation's pawn structure gives White an endgame advantage, and Black must use his bishop pair aggressively in the middlegame to nullify this.[97] However, an analysis of Lasker's use of this variation throughout his career concludes that he had excellent results with it as White against top-class opponents, and sometimes used it in \"must-win\" situations.[98] In Kramnik's opinion, Lasker's play in this game demonstrated deep positional understanding, rather than psychology.[74]/nFine reckoned Lasker paid little attention to the openings,[4] but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen's Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to assess a position quickly and accurately, in terms of who had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt.[99] Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.[100]/nLasker followed Steinitz's principles, and both demonstrated a completely different chess paradigm than the \"romantic\" mentality before them. Thanks to Steinitz and Lasker, positional players gradually became common (Tarrasch, Schlechter, and Rubinstein stand out.) But, while Steinitz created a new school of chess thought, Lasker's talents were far harder for the masses to grasp; hence there was no Lasker school.[101]/nIn addition to his enormous chess skill, Lasker was said to have an excellent competitive temperament: his rival Siegbert Tarrasch once said, \"Lasker occasionally loses a game, but he never loses his head.\"[4] Lasker enjoyed the need to adapt to varying styles and to the shifting fortunes of tournaments.[3] Although very strong in matches, he was even stronger in tournaments. For over 20 years, he always finished ahead of the younger Capablanca: at St. Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1925, and Moscow 1935.[102] Only in 1936 (15 years after their match), when Lasker was 67, did Capablanca finish ahead of him.[103]/nIn 1964, Chessworld magazine published an article in which future World Champion Bobby Fischer listed the ten greatest players in history.[104] Fischer did not include Lasker in the list, deriding him as a \"coffee-house player [who] knew nothing about openings and didn't understand positional chess\".[105] In a poll of the world's leading players taken some time after Fischer's list appeared, Tal, Korchnoi, and Robert Byrne all said that Lasker was the greatest player ever.[106] Both Pal Benko and Byrne stated that Fischer later reconsidered and said that Lasker was a great player.[107][108]/nStatistical ranking systems place Lasker high among the greatest players of all time. The book Warriors of the Mind places him sixth, behind Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Fischer, Mikhail Botvinnik and Capablanca.[109] In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players based on their performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca).[110] The most up-to-date system, Chessmetrics, is rather sensitive to the length of the periods being compared, and ranks Lasker between fifth and second strongest of all time for peak periods ranging in length from one to twenty years.[111] Its author, the statistician Jeff Sonas, concluded that only Kasparov and Karpov surpassed Lasker's long-term dominance of the game.[112] By Chessmetrics' reckoning, Lasker was the number 1 player in 292 different months\u2014a total of over 24 years. His first No. 1 rank was in June 1890, and his last in December 1926\u2014a span of 36\u00bd years.[113] Chessmetrics also considers him the strongest 67-year-old in history: in December 1935, at age 67 years and 0 months, his rating was 2691 (number 7 in the world), well above second-place Viktor Korchnoi's rating at that age (2660, number 39 in the world, in March 1998).[114]/nLasker founded no school of players who played in a similar style.[4] Max Euwe, World Champion 1935\u20131937 and a prolific writer of chess manuals, who had a lifetime 0\u20133 score against Lasker,[115] said, \"It is not possible to learn much from him. One can only stand and wonder.\"[116] However, Lasker's pragmatic, combative approach had a great influence on Soviet players like Mikhail Tal and Viktor Korchnoi.[117]/nThere are several \"Lasker Variations\" in the chess openings, including Lasker's Defense to the Queen's Gambit, Lasker's Defense to the Evans Gambit (which effectively ended the use of this gambit in tournament play until a revival in the 1990s),[118] and the Lasker Variation in the McCutcheon Variation of the French Defense.[119]/nLasker was shocked by the poverty in which Wilhelm Steinitz died and did not intend to die in similar circumstances.[120] He became notorious for demanding high fees for playing matches and tournaments, and he argued that players should own the copyright in their games rather than let publishers get all the profits.[3][121] These demands initially angered editors and other players, but helped to pave the way for the rise of full-time chess professionals who earn most of their living from playing, writing and teaching.[3] Copyright in chess games had been contentious at least as far back as the mid-1840s,[122] and Steinitz and Lasker vigorously asserted that players should own the copyright and wrote copyright clauses into their match contracts.[123] However, Lasker's demands that challengers should raise large purses prevented or delayed some eagerly awaited World Championship matches\u2014for example Frank James Marshall challenged him in 1904 to a match for the World Championship but could not raise the stakes demanded by Lasker until 1907.[50][54] This problem continued throughout the reign of his successor, Capablanca.[124][125]/nSome of the controversial conditions that Lasker insisted on for championship matches led Capablanca to attempt twice (1914 and 1922) to publish rules for such matches, to which other top players readily agreed.[48][126]/nIn his 1905 article on commutative algebra, Lasker introduced the theory of primary decomposition of ideals, which has influence in the theory of Noetherian rings.[127] Rings having the primary decomposition property are called \"Laskerian rings\" in his honor.[54][128]/nHis attempt to create a general theory of all competitive activities were followed by more consistent efforts from von Neumann on game theory,[129] and his later writings about card games presented a significant issue in the mathematical analysis of card games.[79]/nHowever, his dramatic and philosophical works have never been highly regarded.[59]/nLasker died of a kidney infection in New York on January 11, 1941, at the age of 72, as a charity patient at the Mount Sinai Hospital. His funeral service was held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel,[130] and he was buried at historic Beth Olam Cemetery, Queens, New York.[131][132]/nHis wife Martha and his sister, Mrs. Lotta Hirschberg, survived him.[133][134]/nPoet Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler was his sister-in-law./nEdward Lasker, born in Kempen (K\u0119pno), Greater Poland (then Prussia), the German-American chess master, engineer, and author, claimed that he was distantly related to Emanuel Lasker.[135] They both played in the great New York 1924 chess tournament.[136]/nLasker was a good friend of Albert Einstein, who wrote the introduction to the posthumous biography Emanuel Lasker, The Life of a Chess Master by Dr. Jacques Hannak (1952).[137] In this preface Einstein expresses his satisfaction at having met Lasker, writing:/nEmanuel Lasker was undoubtedly one of the most interesting people I came to know in my later years. We must be thankful to those who have penned the story of his life for this and succeeding generations. For there are few men who have had a warm interest in all the great human problems and at the same time kept their personality so uniquely independent./nIn Michael Chabon's alternate history mystery novel, The Yiddish Policemen's Union, the murdered man, Mendel Shpilman (born during the 1960s), being a chess enthusiast, uses the name \"Emanuel Lasker\" as an alias.

Strachey (/\u02c8stre\u026at\u0283i/; 16 November 1916 \u2013 18 May 1975) was a British computer scientist.[1][2][3] He was one of the founders of denotational semantics, and a pioneer in programming language design and computer time-sharing.[4] He has also been credited as possibly being the first developer of a video game.[5] He was a member of the Strachey family, prominent in government, arts, administration, and academia./nChristopher Strachey was born on 16 November 1916 to Oliver Strachey and Rachel (Ray) Costelloe in Hampstead, England. Oliver Strachey was the son of Richard Strachey and the great-grandson of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet. His elder sister was the writer Barbara Strachey. In 1919, the family moved to 51 Gordon Square. The Stracheys belonged to the Bloomsbury Group whose members included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and Christopher's uncle Lytton Strachey. At 13, Christopher went to Gresham's School, Holt where he showed signs of brilliance but in general performed poorly. He was admitted to King's College, Cambridge (the same college as Alan Turing) in 1935 where he continued to neglect his studies. Strachey studied mathematics and then transferred to physics. At the end of his third year at Cambridge, Strachey suffered a nervous breakdown, possibly related to coming to terms with his homosexuality. He returned to Cambridge but managed only a \"lower second\" in the Natural Sciences Tripos.[6]/nUnable to continue his education, Christopher joined Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) as a research physicist. His first job was providing mathematical analysis for the design of electron tubes used in radar. The complexity of the calculations required the use of a differential analyser. This initial experience with a computing machine sparked Strachey's interest and he began to research the topic. An application for a research degree at the University of Cambridge was rejected and Strachey continued to work at STC throughout the Second World War. After the war he fulfilled a long-standing ambition by becoming a schoolmaster at St Edmund's School, Canterbury, teaching mathematics and physics. Three years later he was able to move to the more prestigious Harrow School in 1949, where he stayed for three years./nIn January 1951, a friend introduced him to Mike Woodger of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The lab had successfully built a reduced version of Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) the concept of which dated from 1945: the Pilot ACE. In his spare time, Strachey developed a preliminary version of a program for the game of draughts in May 1951. The game completely exhausted the Pilot ACE's memory. The draughts program failed due to program errors when first run at NPL on 30 July 1951.[7] When Strachey heard about the Manchester Mark 1, which had a much bigger memory, he asked his former fellow-student Alan Turing for the manual and transcribed his program into the operation codes of that machine by around October 1951. By the summer of 1952, the program could \"play a complete game of Draughts at a reasonable speed\".[8][9] While he did not give this game \u2013 which may have been the first video game \u2013 a name, Noah Wardrip-Fruin named it \"M. U. C. Draughts.\"[10]/nStrachey programmed the first Computer music in England - the earliest recording of music played by a computer: a rendition of the British National Anthem \"God Save the King\" on the University of Manchester's Ferranti Mark 1 computer, in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: \"God Save the King\", \"Baa, Baa, Black Sheep\", and \"In the Mood\". Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch restored the acetate master disc in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.[11][12]/nDuring the summer of 1952, Strachey programmed a love letter generator for the Ferranti Mark 1 that is known as the first example of computer-generated literature.[13]/nIn May 1952, Strachey gave a two-part talk on \"the study of control in animals and machines\" (\"cybernetics\") for the BBC Home Service's Science Survey programme.[14][15]/nStrachey worked for the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) from 1952 to 1959. While working on the St. Lawrence Seaway project, he was able to visit several computer centres in the United States and catalogue their instruction sets. Later, he worked on programming both the Elliott 401 computer and the Ferranti Pegasus computer.  Together with Donald B. Gillies, he filed three patents in computing design including the design of base registers for program relocation.  He also worked on the analysis of vibration in aircraft, working briefly with Roger Penrose./nIn 1959, Strachey left NRDC to become a computer consultant working for NRDC, EMI, Ferranti and other organisations on a number of wide-ranging projects. This work included logical design for computers, providing autocode and later the design of high-level programming languages. For a contract to produce the autocode for the Ferranti Orion computer, Strachey hired Peter Landin who became his one assistant for the duration of Strachey's consulting period./nIn 1962, while remaining a consultant, he accepted a position at the University of Cambridge./nIn 1965, Strachey accepted a position at the University of Oxford as the first director of the Programming Research Group and later the university's first professor of computer science and fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. He collaborated with Dana Scott./nStrachey was elected as a distinguished fellow of the British Computer Society in 1971 for his pioneering work in computer science./nIn 1973, Strachey (along with Robert Milne) began to write an essay submitted to the Adams Prize competition, after which they continued work to revising it into book form.  Strachey can be seen and heard in the recorded Lighthill debate on AI[16] (see Lighthill report)./nStrachey contracted an illness diagnosed as jaundice which, after a period of seeming recovery, returned and he died of infectious hepatitis on 18 May 1975.[17]/nStrachey developed the concept of time-sharing in 1959.[18][19] He filed a patent application in February that year and gave a paper \"Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers\" at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris where he passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider.[20][21] This paper is credited by the MIT Computation Center in 1963 as \"the first paper on time-shared computers\".[4]/nHe developed the Combined Programming Language (CPL). His influential set of lecture notes Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages formalised the distinction between L- and R- values (as seen in the C programming language). Strachey also coined the term currying,[citation needed] although he did not invent the underlying concept./nHe was instrumental in the design of the Ferranti Pegasus computer./nHe was a pioneer of early video games creating a version of draughts for the Ferranti Mark 1./nThe macro language m4 derives much from Strachey's GPM (General Purpose Macrogenerator), one of the earliest macro expansion languages.[22]/nThe Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford has a Christopher Strachey Professorship of Computing, currently held by Samson Abramsky FRS.[23]/nIn November 2016, a Strachey 100 event was held at Oxford University to celebrated the centenary of Strachey's birth,[24] including a viewing at the Weston Library in Oxford of the Christopher Strachey archive held in the Bodleian Library collection.[25]", "64404400": "Jessie Forbes Cameron (1883 \u2013 1968) was a British mathematician who in 1912 became the first woman to complete her doctorate in mathematics at the University of Marburg in Germany.[1]/nJessie Cameron was born on 8 January 1883 in Stanley, Scotland, one of eight children whose parents were James Cameron, a school principal at a village school in Perthshire, and his wife Jessie Forbes.[2]/nAfter attending the Perth Academy in Scotland, Jessie Cameron studied for four semesters at University of Edinburgh. From 1905 to 1908, she studied mathematics at Newnham College, which is part of University of Cambridge, in England, and earned a Magister degree (MA).[1][2] There, she was ranked the tenth best in her class (earning her the distinction \"10th Wrangler\"), passed the \"Mathematical Tripos\" and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA).[2]/nCameron moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Germany, to take two more semesters of math, and finally, she enrolled at the University of Marburg, for three semesters. Under the supervision of distinguished mathematician Kurt Hensel,[3] Cameron wrote her dissertation On the decomposition of a prime number in a composed body.[1][2]/nBefore her degree was officially completed, however, there was one additional barrier for her to surmount. It seems she had completed the work and won the approval of her advisor, Dr. Hensel, without realizing a lesser-known caveat for graduation from a German university. According to Lorch-G\u00f6llner, she received the following letter from the university's Dean of Faculty of Philosophy on 10 November 1911.[1]/n\"Although your doctoral thesis was judged favorably by the representatives of mathematics, especially by Privy Councilor Hensel, your admission to the rigorous examination is unfortunately subject to legal difficulties, which have to be fixed before I make an appointment. According to the regulations of our faculty's doctoral regulations, admission to a doctorate is dependent on proof that at least six semesters were studied at a university in the German Reich or a foreign university set up in the German way. The universities of Great Britain are not among the latter./n\"You only studied five semesters at German universities and your ten semesters, which you have spent in Scotland and England, cannot be credited easily ...

It is hoped that he will give his approval, and then I would presumably be able to schedule the day of rigorosum before Christmas as you requested it.\"[1]/nShe  soon received the Minister's dispensation and passed her exams in \"mathematics, physics and philosophy\" on 20 December 1911, with the accolade magna cum laude. Thus, Cameron became the first female to earn a PhD in mathematics at that university and her dissertation was published in 1912.[1]/nOn 28 September 1912 Cameron married the lawyer Edward Vincent Thompson, and she returned to Newnham College for a year beginning in 1912 as an \"Assistant Lecturer.\" With this appointment, according to Lorch-G\u00f6llner, she was \"the only [female] of the first math students after her doctorate - if even temporarily - to work as a mathematics lecturer in a scientific institution.\"[1]/nIn 1913, the couple moved to London so Edward Thompson could pursue his career with a position at the British Treasury. Jessie Thompson gave birth to a daughter and two sons and continued her association with Newnham College until 1927. During the First World War, the Thompson family moved to Berkhamsted, England, where Jessie began working with the British National Council of Women.[2]/nJessie Forbes (Cameron) Thompson died on 27 March 1968 in Southwold, England, at the age of 85.[2]", "605108": "Charles Ehresmann (19 April 1905 \u2013 22 September 1979) was a German-born French mathematician who worked in differential topology and category theory./nHe was an early member of the Bourbaki group, and is known for his work on the differential geometry of smooth fiber bundles, notably the introduction of the concepts of Ehresmann connection and of jet bundles, and for his seminar on category theory./nEhresmann was born in Strasbourg (at the time part of the German Empire) to an Alsatian-speaking family; his father was a gardener.

Norman Steenrod was working in the same direction from a topological point of view,[18] but Ehresmann, influenced by Cartan's ideas, was particularly interested in differentiable (smooth) fiber bundles, and in the differential-geometric aspects of these.[2] This approach led him also to the notion of almost complex structure,[19] which was introduced independently also by Heinz Hopf.[20]/nIn order to obtain a more conceptual understanding of completely integrable systems of partial differential equations, in 1944 Ehresmann inaugurated the theory of foliations,[21][22] which will be later developed by his student Georges Reeb.[23] With the same perspective, he pioneered the notions of jet and of Lie groupoid.[24][25][26][27]/nSince the 1960s, Ehresmann's research interests moved to category theory, where he introduced the concepts of sketch and of strict 2-category.[28][29]/nHis collected works, edited by his wife, appeared in seven volumes in 1980\u20131983 (four volumes published by Imprimerie Evrard, Amiens, and the rest in the journal Cahiers de Topologie et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Diff\u00e9rentielle Cat\u00e9goriques, which he had founded in 1957).[30] His publications include also the books Cat\u00e9gories et structures (Dunod, Paris, 1965) and Alg\u00e8bre (1969)./nJean Dieudonn\u00e9 described Ehresmann's personality as \"... distinguished by forthrightness, simplicity, and total absence of conceit or careerism.

He spent two years (985\u2013987) in England, mostly in  the newly founded monastery of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, assisting Archbishop Oswald of York in restoring the monastic system. He was also abbot and director of the school of this newly founded monastery from 986 to 987.[3]/nAbbo returned to Fleury in 988, where he was selected as its abbot after Abbot Oilbold's death.[2] Another monk who had secured the support of the King and the Bishop of Orl\u00e9ans contested the choice and the matter assumed national importance. Gerbert of Aurillac later Pope Sylvester II, settled the matter in Abbo's favor. The new abbot became active in contemporary politics: for example, he attended the Synod of Verzy, near Reims, at which Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims was tried for treason and deposed, to make way for Gerbert.  Arnulf of Orl\u00e9ans, with whom Abbo feuded over monastic reform from 988 until 994, also attended the conference./nIn 996 King Robert II (Robert the Pious) sent him to Rome to ward off a threatened papal interdict over Robert's marriage to Bertha. On the way to Rome he met Pope Gregory V, who was a fugitive from the city from which the Antipope John XVI had expelled him. Between the Pontiff and the Abbot the greatest esteem and affection existed. The royal petition for a dispensation was rejected. Abbo succeeded in bringing about the restoration of Arnulf to the see of Reims. He was influential in calming the excitement and fear about the end of the world which was widespread in Europe in 1000.[4]/nIn 1004 he attempted to restore discipline in the monastery of La R\u00e9ole, in Gascony, by transferring some of the monks of Fleury into that community. But the trouble increased; fighting began between the two parties and when Abbo endeavoured to separate them he was pierced in the side by a lance. He concealed the wound and reached his cell, where he died in the arms of his faithful disciple Aimoin, who has left an account of his labours and virtues. The miracles wrought at his tomb soon caused the Church of Gaul to regard him as a saint and martyr, although he does not seem to have been canonized by Rome officially. His feast is kept on 13 November./nDuring his time in England, Abbo learned of the martyrdom of Edmund of East Anglia (November 870).  In response, he wrote a passion in Latin about it. He also wrote a Latin grammar for his English students, and three poems to Dunstan. Among his other works are a simplification of the computus, the computation of the date of Easter; an Epitome de XCI Romanorum Pontificum Vitis (book on the lives of Roman popes, which is an abridgement of the earlier Liber Pontificalis), a Collectio Canonum, with clarifications about topics of Canon Law, and other treatises on controversial topics and letters. Around 980 to 985, he wrote a commentary on the \"Calculus\" of Victorius of Aquitaine, before the introduction of Arabic numerals, when calculations were often quite complex. The wide range of Abbo's thought is reflected in the commentary, covering the nature of wisdom, the philosophy of numbers, the relationship of unity and plurality, and the arithmetic of the Calculus. Abbo drew on his knowledge of grammar, logic and cosmology to illustrate his arguments, and set it all in the broader context of his theology of Creation. Most of Abbo's works can be found in the Patrologia Latina (CXXXIX, 375\u2013582)./nThere is one contemporary biography, written by his disciple Aimoin, in which much of Abbo's correspondence was reproduced. It is of great importance, including as a historical source of information about the reign of Robert II of France, especially with reference to the Papacy./nRichard W. Pfaff sums up Abbo's achievements as follows: \"One of the most versatile thinkers and writers of his time, Abbo put his mark on several areas of medieval life and thought, but none more so than in transmitting much that was valuable from the tradition of reformed French monasticism to the nascent monastic culture of late tenth-century England.\"[5]", "1358791": "Nicolae Popescu (Romanian: [niko\u02c8la.e po\u02c8pesku]; 22 September 1937 \u2013 29 July 2010) was a Romanian mathematician and professor at the University of Bucharest.

He blamed the Jews for the ascendant role of money in society and called for Judaism to be \"extirpated root and branch\" from German society./nIn 1816 he was invited to Jena to fill the chair of theoretical philosophy (including mathematics, physics, and philosophy proper), and entered upon a crusade against the prevailing Romanticism. In politics he was a strong Liberal and Unionist, and he did much to inspire the organization of the Burschenschaft. He also published a pamphlet calling for the exclusion of the Jews from public life in Germany. In 1816 he had published his views in a brochure, Von deutschem Bund und deutscher Staatsverfassung, dedicated to \"the youth of Germany\", and his influence gave a powerful impetus to the agitation which led in 1819 to the issue of the Carlsbad Decrees by the representatives of the German governments.[4]/nKarl Sand, the murderer of August von Kotzebue, was one of Fries's pupils; and a letter of his, found on another student, warning Sand against participation in secret societies, was twisted by the suspicious authorities into evidence of Fries' conspiracy.

Hegel argued that Fries' methodology was not sufficiently scientific and that, therefore, his conclusions were illogical. Fries responded by accusing Hegel of defending the existing order and his own privileged position within it.

Their sons George Ulrich (born 1927) and Fred Gunther (born 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in K\u00f6nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp\u2019s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in K\u00f6nigsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced./nWhen the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists.[1] Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Brauer accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English.[1] Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in the Holocaust.[1]/nHermann Weyl invited Brauer to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Brauer and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Brauer was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer\u2019s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching./nIn 1948, Brauer moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan./nIn 1952, Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University and retired in 1971. His students included Donald John Lewis, Donald Passman, and I. Martin Isaacs. Brauer was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954,[2] the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1955,[3] and the American Philosophical Society in 1974.[4] The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer, Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski, and Carl Ludwig Siegel./nSeveral theorems bear his name, including Brauer's induction theorem, which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory, and its corollary Brauer's characterization of characters, which is central to the theory of group characters./nThe Brauer\u2013Fowler theorem, published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups, for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure./nBrauer applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups. The Brauer\u2013Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin\u2013Brauer\u2013Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein\u2013Walter theorem, classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman's Z* theorem. The theory of a block with a cyclic defect group, first worked out by Brauer in the case when the principal block has defect group of order p, and later worked out in full generality by E. C. Dade, also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block./nIn 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.[5]/nEduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein's encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study\u2019s article, and Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened.  Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published[6] by Okayama University in Japan. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his Collected Papers.  His title was \"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\". Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer\u2019s article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction:/nWhile still in K\u00f6nigsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift \"\u00dcber Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\"[7]  which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto.", "605140": "Robert Daniel Carmichael (March 1, 1879 \u2013 May 2, 1967) was an American mathematician./nCarmichael was born in Goodwater, Alabama. He attended Lineville College, briefly, and he earned his bachelor's degree in 1898, while he was studying towards his Ph.D. degree at Princeton University. Carmichael completed the requirements for his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1911. Carmichael's Ph.D. research in mathematics was done under the guidance of the noted American mathematician G. David Birkhoff, and it is considered to be the first significant American contribution to the knowledge of differential equations in mathematics./nCarmichael next taught at Indiana University from 1911 to 1915. Then he moved on to the University of Illinois, where he remained from 1915 until his retirement in 1947./nCarmichael is known for his research in what are now called the Carmichael numbers (a subset of Fermat pseudoprimes, numbers satisfying properties of primes described by Fermat's Little Theorem although they are not primes), Carmichael's totient function conjecture, Carmichael's theorem, and the Carmichael function, all significant in number theory and in the study of the prime numbers. He found the smallest Carmichael number, 561, and over 50 years later, it was proven that there are infinitely many of them. Carmichael also described the Steiner system S(5,8,24) in his 1931 paper Tactical Configurations of Rank 2 and his 1937 book Introduction to the Theory of Groups of Finite Order, but the structure is often named after Ernst Witt, who rediscovered it in 1938./nWhile at Indiana University, Carmichael was involved with the special theory of relativity.[1]", "605144": "Ernesto Ces\u00e0ro (12 March 1859 \u2013 12 September 1906) was an Italian mathematician who worked in the field of differential geometry.

He settled in Rome, where he stayed as a professor at the Sapienza University until his accidental death, while trying to rescue his youngest son Manlio from drowning./nCes\u00e0ro's main contributions are in the field of differential geometry. Lessons of intrinsic geometry, written in 1894, explains in particular the construction of a fractal curve.

He was a lawyer by trade, and served as a privy councillor to both Henry III and Henry IV of France./nVi\u00e8te was born at Fontenay-le-Comte in present-day Vend\u00e9e. His grandfather was a merchant from La Rochelle. His father, Etienne Vi\u00e8te, was an attorney in Fontenay-le-Comte and a notary in Le Busseau. His mother was the aunt of Barnab\u00e9 Brisson, a magistrate and the first president of parliament during the ascendancy of the Catholic League of France./nVi\u00e8te went to a Franciscan school and in 1558 studied law at Poitiers, graduating as a Bachelor of Laws in 1559. A year later, he began his career as an attorney in his native town.[1] From the outset, he was entrusted with some major cases, including the settlement of rent in Poitou for the widow of King Francis I of France and looking after the interests of Mary, Queen of Scots./nIn 1564, Vi\u00e8te entered the service of Antoinette d'Aubeterre, Lady Soubise, wife of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise, one of the main Huguenot military leaders and accompanied him to Lyon to collect documents about his heroic defence of that city against the troops of Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours just the year before./nThe same year, at Parc-Soubise, in the commune of Mouchamps in present-day Vend\u00e9e, Vi\u00e8te became the tutor of Catherine de Parthenay, Soubise's twelve-year-old daughter. He taught her science and mathematics and wrote for her numerous treatises on astronomy and trigonometry, some of which have survived. In these treatises, Vi\u00e8te used decimal numbers (twenty years before Stevin's paper) and he also noted the elliptic orbit of the planets,[2] forty years before Kepler and twenty years before Giordano Bruno's death./nJohn V de Parthenay presented him to King Charles IX of France. Vi\u00e8te wrote a genealogy of the Parthenay family and following the death of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise in 1566 his biography./nIn 1568, Antoinette, Lady Soubise, married her daughter Catherine to Baron Charles de Quellenec and Vi\u00e8te went with Lady Soubise to La Rochelle, where he mixed with the highest Calvinist aristocracy, leaders like Coligny and Cond\u00e9 and Queen Jeanne d\u2019Albret of Navarre and her son, Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV of France./nIn 1570, he refused to represent the Soubise ladies in their infamous lawsuit against the Baron De Quellenec, where they claimed the Baron was unable (or unwilling) to provide an heir./nIn 1571, he enrolled as an attorney in Paris, and continued to visit his student Catherine. He regularly lived in Fontenay-le-Comte, where he took on some municipal functions. He began publishing his Universalium inspectionum ad Canonem mathematicum liber singularis and wrote new mathematical research by night or during periods of leisure. He was known to dwell on any one question for up to three days, his elbow on the desk, feeding himself without changing position (according to his friend, Jacques de Thou).[3]/nIn 1572, Vi\u00e8te was in Paris during the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. That night, Baron De Quellenec was killed after having tried to save Admiral Coligny the previous night. The same year, Vi\u00e8te met Fran\u00e7oise de Rohan, Lady of Garnache, and became her adviser against Jacques, Duke of Nemours./nIn 1573, he became a councillor of the Parlement of Rennes, at Rennes, and two years later, he obtained the agreement of Antoinette d'Aubeterre for the marriage of Catherine of Parthenay to Duke Ren\u00e9 de Rohan, Fran\u00e7oise's brother./nIn 1576, Henri, duc de Rohan took him under his special protection, recommending him in 1580 as \"ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates\". In 1579, Vi\u00e8te finished the printing of his Universalium inspectionum (Mettayer publisher), published as an appendix to a book of two trigonometric tables (Canon mathematicus, seu ad triangula, the \"canon\" referred to by the title of his Universalium inspectionum, and Canonion triangulorum laterum rationalium). A year later, he was appointed ma\u00eetre des requ\u00eates to the parliament of Paris, committed to serving the king. That same year, his success in the trial between the Duke of Nemours and Fran\u00e7oise de Rohan, to the benefit of the latter, earned him the resentment of the tenacious Catholic League./nBetween 1583 and 1585, the League persuaded Henry III to release Vi\u00e8te, Vi\u00e8te having been accused of sympathy with the Protestant cause. Henry of Navarre, at Rohan's instigation, addressed two letters to King Henry III of France on March 3 and April 26, 1585, in an attempt to obtain Vi\u00e8te's restoration to his former office, but he failed.[1]/nVi\u00e8te retired to Fontenay and Beauvoir-sur-Mer, with Fran\u00e7ois de Rohan. He spent four years devoted to mathematics, writing his New Algebra (1591)./nIn 1589, Henry III took refuge in Blois. He commanded the royal officials to be at Tours before 15 April 1589. Vi\u00e8te was one of the first who came back to Tours. He deciphered the secret letters of the Catholic League and other enemies of the king. Later, he had arguments with the classical scholar Joseph Juste Scaliger. Vi\u00e8te triumphed against him in 1590./nAfter the death of Henry III, Vi\u00e8te became a privy councillor to Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV.[4]:\u200a75\u201377\u200a He was appreciated by the king, who admired his mathematical talents. Vi\u00e8te was given the position of councillor of the parlement at Tours. In 1590, Vi\u00e8te discovered the key to a Spanish cipher, consisting of more than 500 characters, and this meant that all dispatches in that language which fell into the hands of the French could be easily read.[5]/nHenry IV published a letter from Commander Moreo to the King of Spain. The contents of this letter, read by Vi\u00e8te, revealed that the head of the League in France, Charles, Duke of Mayenne, planned to become king in place of Henry IV. This publication led to the settlement of the Wars of Religion. The King of Spain accused Vi\u00e8te of having used magical powers.\nIn 1593, Vi\u00e8te published his arguments against Scaliger. Beginning in 1594, he was appointed exclusively deciphering the enemy's secret codes./nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII published his bull Inter gravissimas and ordered Catholic kings to comply with the change from the Julian calendar, based on the calculations of the Calabrian doctor Aloysius Lilius, aka Luigi Lilio or Luigi Giglio. His work was resumed, after his death, by the scientific adviser to the Pope, Christopher Clavius./nVi\u00e8te accused Clavius, in a series of pamphlets (1600), of introducing corrections and intermediate days in an arbitrary manner, and misunderstanding the meaning of the works of his predecessor, particularly in the calculation of the lunar cycle. Vi\u00e8te gave a new timetable, which Clavius cleverly refuted,[6] after Vi\u00e8te's death, in his Explicatio (1603)./nIt is said that Vi\u00e8te was wrong. Without doubt, he believed himself to be a kind of \"King of Times\" as the historian of mathematics, Dhombres, claimed.[7] It is true that Vi\u00e8te held Clavius in low esteem, as evidenced by De Thou:/nHe said that Clavius was very clever to explain the principles of mathematics, that he heard with great clarity what the authors had invented, and wrote various treatises compiling what had been written before him without quoting its references. So, his works were in a better order which was scattered and confused in early writings./nIn 1596, Scaliger resumed his attacks from the University of Leyden. Vi\u00e8te replied definitively the following year. In March that same year, Adriaan van Roomen sought the resolution, by any of Europe's top mathematicians, to a polynomial equation of degree 45. King Henri IV received a snub from the Dutch ambassador, who claimed that there was no mathematician in France. He said it was simply because some Dutch mathematician, Adriaan van Roomen, had not asked any Frenchman to solve his problem./nVi\u00e8te came, saw the problem, and, after leaning on a window for a few minutes, solved it. It was the equation between sin(x) and sin(x/45). He resolved this at once, and said he was able to give at the same time (actually the next day) the solution to the other 22 problems to the ambassador. \"Ut legit, ut solvit,\" he later said. Further, he sent a new problem back to Van Roomen, for resolution by Euclidean tools (rule and compass) of the lost answer to the problem first set by Apollonius of Perga. Van Roomen could not overcome that problem without resorting to a trick (see detail below)./nIn 1598, Vi\u00e8te was granted special leave. Henry IV, however, charged him to end the revolt of the Notaries, whom the King had ordered to pay back their fees. Sick and exhausted by work, he left the King's service in December 1602 and received 20,000 \u00e9cu, which were found at his bedside after his death./nA few weeks before his death, he wrote a final thesis on issues of cryptography, whose memory made obsolete all encryption methods of the time. He died on 23 February 1603, as De Thou wrote,[8] leaving two daughters, Jeanne, whose mother was Barbe Cottereau, and Suzanne, whose mother was Julienne Leclerc. Jeanne, the eldest, died in 1628, having married Jean Gabriau, a councillor of the parliament of Brittany. Suzanne died in January 1618 in Paris./nThe cause of Vi\u00e8te's death is unknown. Alexander Anderson, student of Vi\u00e8te and publisher of his scientific writings, speaks of a \"praeceps et immaturum autoris fatum.\" (meeting an untimely end).[5][9]/nAt the end of the 16th century, mathematics was placed under the dual aegis of Greek geometry and the Arabic procedures for resolution. At the time of Vi\u00e8te, algebra therefore oscillated between arithmetic, which gave the appearance of a list of rules; and geometry, which seemed more rigorous. Meanwhile, Italian mathematicians Luca Pacioli, Scipione del Ferro, Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia, Gerolamo Cardano, Lodovico Ferrari, and especially Raphael Bombelli (1560) all developed techniques for solving equations of the third degree, which heralded a new era./nOn the other hand, from the German school of Coss, the Welsh mathematician Robert Recorde (1550) and the Dutchman Simon Stevin (1581) brought an early algebraic notation: the use of decimals and exponents. However, complex numbers remained at best a philosophical way of thinking. Descartes, almost a century after their invention, used them as imaginary numbers. Only positive solutions were considered and using geometrical proof was common./nThe mathematician's task was in fact twofold. It was necessary to produce algebra in a more geometrical way (i.e. to give it a rigorous foundation), and it was also necessary to make geometry more algebraic, allowing for analytical calculation in the plane. Vi\u00e8te and Descartes solved this dual task in a double revolution./nFirstly, Vi\u00e8te gave algebra a foundation as strong as that of geometry. He then ended the algebra of procedures (al-Jabr and al-Muqabala), creating the first symbolic algebra, and claiming that with it, all problems could be solved (nullum non problema solvere).[10][11]/nIn his dedication of the Isagoge to Catherine de Parthenay, Vi\u00e8te wrote:/n\"These things which are new are wont in the beginning to be set forth rudely and formlessly and must then be polished and perfected in succeeding centuries. Behold, the art which I present is new, but in truth so old, so spoiled and defiled by the barbarians, that I considered it necessary, in order to introduce an entirely new form into it, to think out and publish a new vocabulary, having gotten rid of all its pseudo-technical terms...\"[12]/nVi\u00e8te did not know \"multiplied\" notation (given by William Oughtred in 1631) or the symbol of equality, =, an absence which is more striking because Robert Recorde had used the present symbol for this purpose since 1557, and Guilielmus Xylander had used parallel vertical lines since 1575.[5] Note also the use of a 'u' like symbol with a number above it for an unknown to a given power by Rafael Bombelli in 1572.[13]/nVi\u00e8te had neither much time, nor students able to brilliantly illustrate his method. He took years in publishing his work (he was very meticulous), and most importantly, he made a very specific choice to separate the unknown variables, using consonants for parameters and vowels for unknowns. In this notation he perhaps followed some older contemporaries, such as Petrus Ramus, who designated the points in geometrical figures by vowels, making use of consonants, R, S, T, etc., only when these were exhausted.[5] This choice proved unpopular with future mathematicians and Descartes, among others, preferred the first letters of the alphabet to designate the parameters and the latter for the unknowns./nVi\u00e8te also remained a prisoner of his time in several respects. First, he was heir of Ramus and did not address the lengths as numbers. His writing kept track of homogeneity, which did not simplify their reading. He failed to recognize the complex numbers of Bombelli and needed to double-check his algebraic answers through geometrical construction. Although he was fully aware that his new algebra was sufficient to give a solution, this concession tainted his reputation./nHowever, Vi\u00e8te created many innovations: the binomial formula, which would be taken by Pascal and Newton, and the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots, called Vi\u00e8te's formula./nVi\u00e8te was well skilled in most modern artifices, aiming at the simplification of equations by the substitution of new quantities having a certain connection with the primitive unknown quantities. Another of his works, Recensio canonica effectionum geometricarum, bears a modern stamp, being what was later called an algebraic geometry\u2014a collection of precepts how to construct algebraic expressions with the use of ruler and compass only. While these writings were generally intelligible, and therefore of the greatest didactic importance, the principle of homogeneity, first enunciated by Vi\u00e8te, was so far in advance of his times that most readers seem to have passed it over. That principle had been made use of by the Greek authors of the classic age; but of later mathematicians only Hero, Diophantus, etc., ventured to regard lines and surfaces as mere numbers that could be joined to give a new number, their sum.[5]/nThe study of such sums, found in the works of Diophantus, may have prompted Vi\u00e8te to lay down the principle that quantities occurring in an equation ought to be homogeneous, all of them lines, or surfaces, or solids, or supersolids \u2014 an equation between mere numbers being inadmissible. During the centuries that have elapsed between Vi\u00e8te's day and the present, several changes of opinion have taken place on this subject. Modern mathematicians like to make homogeneous such equations as are not so from the beginning, in order to get values of a symmetrical shape. Vi\u00e8te himself did not see that far; nevertheless, he indirectly suggested the thought. He also conceived methods for the general resolution of equations of the second, third and fourth degrees different from those of Scipione dal Ferro and Lodovico Ferrari, with which he had not been acquainted. He devised an approximate numerical solution of equations of the second and third degrees, wherein Leonardo of Pisa must have preceded him, but by a method which was completely lost.[5]/nAbove all, Vi\u00e8te was the first mathematician who introduced notations for the problem (and not just for the unknowns).[10] As a result, his algebra was no longer limited to the statement of rules, but relied on an efficient computational algebra, in which the operations act on the letters and the results can be obtained at the end of the calculations by a simple replacement. This approach, which is the heart of contemporary algebraic method, was a fundamental step in the development of mathematics.[14] With this, Vi\u00e8te marked the end of medieval algebra (from Al-Khwarizmi to Stevin) and opened the modern period./nBeing wealthy, Vi\u00e8te began to publish at his own expense, for a few friends and scholars in almost every country of Europe, the systematic presentation of his mathematic theory, which he called \"species logistic\" (from species: symbol) or art of calculation on symbols (1591).[15]/nHe described in three stages how to proceed for solving a problem:/nAmong the problems addressed by Vi\u00e8te with this method is the complete resolution of the quadratic equations of the form \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n2\n\n\n+\nX\nb\n=\nc\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X^{2}+Xb=c}\n\n and third-degree equations of the form \n\n\n\n\nX\n\n3\n\n\n+\na\nX\n=\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle X^{3}+aX=b}\n\n (Vi\u00e8te reduced it to quadratic equations). He knew the connection between the positive roots of an equation (which, in his day, were alone thought of as roots) and the coefficients of the different powers of the unknown quantity (see Vi\u00e8te's formulas and their application on quadratic equations). He discovered the formula for deriving the sine of a multiple angle, knowing that of the simple angle with due regard to the periodicity of sines. This formula must have been known to Vi\u00e8te in 1593.[5]/nIn 1593, based on geometrical considerations and through trigonometric calculations perfectly mastered, he discovered the first infinite product in the history of mathematics by giving an expression of \u03c0, now known as Vi\u00e8te's formula:[16]/nHe provides 10 decimal places of \u03c0 by applying the Archimedes method to a polygon with 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0216 = 393,216 sides./nThis famous controversy is told by Tallemant des R\u00e9aux in these terms (46th story from the first volume of Les Historiettes. M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du XVIIe si\u00e8cle):/n\"In the times of Henri the fourth, a Dutchman called Adrianus Romanus, a learned mathematician, but not so good as he believed, published a treatise in which he proposed a question to all the mathematicians of Europe, but did not ask any Frenchman. Shortly after, a state ambassador came to the King at Fontainebleau. The King took pleasure in showing him all the sights, and he said people there were excellent in every profession in his kingdom. 'But, Sire,' said the ambassador, 'you have no mathematician, according to Adrianus Romanus, who didn't mention any in his catalog.' 'Yes, we have,' said the King. 'I have an excellent man. Go and seek Monsieur Viette,' he ordered. Vieta, who was at Fontainebleau, came at once. The ambassador sent for the book from Adrianus Romanus and showed the proposal to Vieta, who had arrived in the gallery, and before the King came out, he had already written two solutions with a pencil. By the evening he had sent many other solutions to the ambassador.\"/nThis suggests that the Adrien van Roomen problem is an equation of 45\u00b0, which Vi\u00e8te recognized immediately as a chord of an arc of 8\u00b0 (\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{45}}}\n\n turn). It was then easy to determine the following 22 positive alternatives, the only valid ones at the time./nWhen, in 1595, Vi\u00e8te published his response to the problem set by Adriaan van Roomen, he proposed finding the resolution of the old problem of Apollonius, namely to find a circle tangent to three given circles. Van Roomen proposed a solution using a hyperbola, with which Vi\u00e8te did not agree, as he was hoping for a solution using Euclidean tools./nVi\u00e8te published his own solution in 1600 in his work Apollonius Gallus. In this paper, Vi\u00e8te made use of the center of similitude of two circles.[5] His friend De Thou said that Adriaan van Roomen immediately left the University of W\u00fcrzburg, saddled his horse and went to Fontenay-le-Comte, where Vi\u00e8te lived. According to De Thou, he stayed a month with him, and learned the methods of the new algebra. The two men became friends and Vi\u00e8te paid all van Roomen's expenses before his return to W\u00fcrzburg./nThis resolution had an almost immediate impact in Europe and Vi\u00e8te earned the admiration of many mathematicians over the centuries. Vi\u00e8te did not deal with cases (circles together, these tangents, etc.), but recognized that the number of solutions depends on the relative position of the three circles and outlined the ten resulting situations. Descartes completed (in 1643) the theorem of the three circles of Apollonius, leading to a quadratic equation in 87 terms, each of which is a product of six factors (which, with this method, makes the actual construction humanly impossible).[17]/nVi\u00e8te was accused of Protestantism by the Catholic League, but he was not a Huguenot. His father was, according to Dhombres.[18] Indifferent in religious matters, he did not adopt the Calvinist faith of Parthenay, nor that of his other protectors, the Rohan family. His call to the parliament of Rennes proved the opposite. At the reception as a member of the court of Brittany, on 6 April 1574, he read in public a statement of Catholic faith.[18]/nNevertheless, Vi\u00e8te defended and protected Protestants his whole life, and suffered, in turn, the wrath of the League. It seems that for him, the stability of the state was to be preserved and that under this requirement, the King's religion did not matter. At that time, such people were called \"Politicals.\"/nFurthermore, at his death, he did not want to confess his sins. A friend had to convince him that his own daughter would not find a husband, were he to refuse the sacraments of the Catholic Church. Whether Vi\u00e8te was an atheist or not is a matter of debate.[18]/nDuring the ascendancy of the Catholic League, Vi\u00e8te's secretary was Nathaniel Tarporley, perhaps one of the more interesting and enigmatic mathematicians of 16th-century England. When he returned to London, Tarporley became one of the trusted friends of Thomas Harriot./nApart from Catherine de Parthenay, Vi\u00e8te's other notable students were: French mathematician Jacques Aleaume, from Orleans, Marino Ghetaldi of Ragusa, Jean de Beaugrand and the Scottish mathematician Alexander Anderson. They illustrated his theories by publishing his works and continuing his methods. At his death, his heirs gave his manuscripts to Peter Aleaume.[19] We give here the most important posthumous editions:/nThe same year, there appeared an Isagoge by Antoine Vasset (a pseudonym of Claude Hardy), and the following year, a translation into Latin of Beaugrand, which Descartes would have received./nIn 1648, the corpus of mathematical works printed by Frans van Schooten, professor at Leiden University (Elzevirs presses). He was assisted by Jacques Golius and Mersenne./nThe English mathematicians Thomas Harriot and Isaac Newton, and the Dutch physicist Willebrord Snellius, the French mathematicians Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal all used Vi\u00e8te's symbolism./nAbout 1770, the Italian mathematician Targioni Tozzetti, found in Florence Vi\u00e8te's Harmonicon coeleste. Vi\u00e8te had written in it: Describat Planeta Ellipsim ad motum anomaliae ad Terram. (That shows he adopted Copernicus' system and understood before Kepler the elliptic form of the orbits of planets.)[21]/nIn 1841, the French mathematician Michel Chasles was one of the first to reevaluate his role in the development of modern algebra./nIn 1847, a letter from Fran\u00e7ois Arago, perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences (Paris), announced his intention to write a biography of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te./nBetween 1880 and 1890, the polytechnician Fr\u00e9deric Ritter, based in Fontenay-le-Comte, was the first translator of the works of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te and his first contemporary biographer with Benjamin Fillon./nThirty-four years after the death of Vi\u00e8te, the philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes published his method and a book of geometry that changed the landscape of algebra and built on Vi\u00e8te's work, applying it to the geometry by removing its requirements of homogeneity. Descartes, accused by Jean Baptiste Chauveau, a former classmate of La Fl\u00e8che, explained  in a letter to Mersenne (1639 February) that he never read those works.[22] Descartes accepted the Vi\u00e8te's view of mathematics for which the study shall stress the self-evidence of the results that Descartes implemented translating the symbolic algebra in geometric reasoning.[23] Descartes adopted the term mathesis universalis, which he called an \"already venerable term with a received usage\", which originated in van Roomen's book Mathesis Universalis.[24]/n\"I have no knowledge of this surveyor and I wonder what he said, that we studied Vi\u00e8te's work together in Paris, because it is a book which I cannot remember having seen the cover, while I was in France.\"/nElsewhere, Descartes said that Vi\u00e8te's notations were confusing and used unnecessary geometric justifications. In some letters, he showed he understands the program of the Artem Analyticem Isagoge; in others, he shamelessly caricatured Vi\u00e8te's proposals. One of his biographers, Charles Adam,[25] noted this contradiction:/n\"These words are surprising, by the way, for he (Descartes) had just said a few lines earlier that he had tried to put in his geometry only what he believed \"was known neither by Vieta nor by anyone else\". So he was informed of what Vi\u00e8te knew; and he must have read his works previously.\"/nCurrent research has not shown the extent of the direct influence of the works of Vi\u00e8te on Descartes. This influence could have been formed through the works of Adriaan van Roomen or Jacques Aleaume at the Hague, or through the book by Jean de Beaugrand.[26]/nIn his letters to Mersenne, Descartes consciously minimized the originality and depth of the work of his predecessors. \"I began,\" he says, \"where Vieta finished\". His views emerged in the 17th century and mathematicians won a clear algebraic language without the requirements of homogeneity. Many contemporary studies have restored the work of Parthenay's mathematician, showing he had the double merit of introducing the first elements of literal calculation and building a first axiomatic for algebra.[27]/nAlthough Vi\u00e8te was not the first to propose notation of unknown quantities by letters - Jordanus Nemorarius had done this in the past - we can reasonably estimate that it would be simplistic to summarize his innovations for that discovery and place him at the junction of algebraic transformations made during the late sixteenth\u00a0\u2013 early 17th century.[citation needed]", "605155": "Elwin Bruno Christoffel (German: [k\u0281\u026a\u02c8st\u0254fl\u0329]; 10 November 1829 \u2013 15 March 1900) was a German mathematician and physicist. He introduced fundamental concepts of differential geometry, opening the way for the development of tensor calculus, which would later provide the mathematical basis for general relativity./nChristoffel was born on 10 November 1829 in Montjoie (now Monschau) in Prussia in a family of cloth merchants. He was initially educated at home in languages and mathematics, then attended the Jesuit Gymnasium and the Friedrich-Wilhelms Gymnasium in Cologne. In 1850 he went to the University of Berlin, where he studied mathematics with Gustav Dirichlet (which had a strong influence over him)[1] among others, as well as attending courses in physics and chemistry. He received his doctorate in Berlin in 1856 for a thesis on the motion of electricity in homogeneous bodies written under the supervision of Martin Ohm, Ernst Kummer and Heinrich Gustav Magnus.[2]/nAfter receiving his doctorate, Christoffel returned to Montjoie where he spent the following three years in isolation from the academic community. However, he continued to study mathematics (especially mathematical physics) from books by Bernhard Riemann, Dirichlet and Augustin-Louis Cauchy. He also continued his research, publishing two papers in differential geometry.[2]/nIn 1859 Christoffel returned to Berlin, earning his habilitation and becoming a Privatdozent at  the University of Berlin. In 1862 he was appointed to a chair at the Polytechnic School in Z\u00fcrich left vacant by Dedekind. He organised a new institute of mathematics at the young institution (it had been established only seven years earlier) that was highly appreciated. He also continued to publish research, and in 1868 he was elected a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and of the Istituto Lombardo in Milan. In 1869 Christoffel returned to Berlin as a professor at the Gewerbeakademie (now part of the Technical University of Berlin), with Hermann Schwarz succeeding him in Z\u00fcrich. However, strong competition from the close proximity to the University of Berlin meant that the Gewerbeakademie could not attract enough students to sustain advanced mathematical courses and Christoffel left Berlin again after three years.[2]/nIn 1872 Christoffel became a professor at the University of Strasbourg, a centuries-old institution that was being reorganized into a modern university after Prussia's annexation of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-Prussian War. Christoffel, together with his colleague Theodor Reye, built a reputable mathematics department at Strasbourg. He continued to publish research and had several doctoral students including Rikitaro Fujisawa, Ludwig Maurer and Paul Epstein. Christoffel retired from the University of Strasbourg in 1894, being succeeded by Heinrich Weber.[2] After retirement he continued to work and publish, with the last treatise finished just before his death and published posthumously.[1]/nChristoffel died on 15 March 1900 in Strasbourg. He never married and left no family.[2]/nChristoffel is mainly remembered for his seminal contributions to differential geometry. In a famous 1869 paper on the equivalence problem for differential forms in n variables, published in Crelle's Journal,[3] he introduced the fundamental technique later called covariant differentiation and used it to define the Riemann\u2013Christoffel tensor (the most common method used to express the curvature of Riemannian manifolds). In the same paper he introduced the Christoffel symbols \n\n\n\n\n\u0393\n\nk\ni\nj\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma _{kij}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n\u0393\n\ni\nj\n\n\nk\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Gamma _{ij}^{k}}\n\n which express the components of the Levi-Civita connection with respect to a system of local coordinates. Christoffel's ideas were generalized and greatly developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and his student Tullio Levi-Civita, who turned them into the concept of tensors and the absolute differential calculus. The absolute differential calculus, later named tensor calculus, forms the mathematical basis of the general theory of relativity.[2]/nChristoffel contributed to complex analysis, where the Schwarz\u2013Christoffel mapping is the first nontrivial constructive application of the Riemann mapping theorem. The Schwarz\u2013Christoffel mapping has many applications to the theory of elliptic functions and to areas of physics.[2] In the field of elliptic functions he also published results concerning abelian integrals and theta functions./nChristoffel generalized the Gaussian quadrature method for integration and, in connection to this, he also introduced the Christoffel\u2013Darboux formula for Legendre polynomials[4] (he later also published the formula for general orthogonal polynomials)./nChristoffel also worked on potential theory and the theory of differential equations, however much of his research in these areas went unnoticed. He published two papers on the propagation of discontinuities in the solutions of partial differential equations which represent pioneering work in the theory of shock waves. He also studied physics and published research in optics, however his contributions here quickly lost their utility with the abandonment of the concept of the luminiferous aether.[2]/nChristoffel was elected as a corresponding member of several academies:/nChristoffel was also awarded two distinctions for his activity by the Kingdom of Prussia:", "61062118": "Amanda G.

The scaled-up model ranked ahead of supercomputer in Japan at that time and achieved the best ranking India ever achieved in supercomputing. He was the founding director of Computational Research labs in Pune, where the scaling-up work was performed. He continues to work on his new architecture for supercomputing./nKarmarkar's algorithm solves linear programming problems in polynomial time. These problems are represented by a number of linear constraints involving a number of variables. The previous method of solving these problems consisted of considering the problem as a high-dimensional solid with vertices, where the solution was approached by traversing from vertex to vertex. Karmarkar's novel method approaches the solution by cutting through the above solid in its traversal. Consequently, complex optimization problems are solved much faster using the Karmarkar's algorithm. A practical example of this efficiency is the solution to a complex problem in communications network optimization, where the solution time was reduced from weeks to days. His algorithm thus enables faster business and policy decisions. Karmarkar's algorithm has stimulated the development of several interior-point methods, some of which are used in current implementations of linear-program solvers./nAfter working on the interior-point method, Karmarkar worked on a new architecture for supercomputing, based on concepts from finite geometry, especially projective geometry over finite fields.[5][6][7][8]/nCurrently,[when?] he is synthesizing these concepts with some new ideas he calls sculpturing free space (a non-linear analogue of what has popularly been described as folding the perfect corner).[9] This approach allows him to extend this work to the physical design of machines.

He had varied interests across the whole of physical oceanography, including the study of ice, polynyas, Rossby waves, instabilities and eddies. He completed his doctorate in Numerical studies in Dynamical Oceanography at Trinity College, Cambridge University in 1972. After a year conducting research in California, he returned to Cambridge to work with his former PhD supervisor, Adrian Gill[2] and spent the next twelve years at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, the latter part of this being spent as a Research Fellow of Clare Hall.[3] He maintained close ties to the US during this period, including teaching at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution./nIn 1985 he moved to Oxford to join the Robert Hooke Institute, also serving as a Research Fellow of Wolfson College, and later as a Fellow of St Cross College. In Oxford he \"built and led a research team at the forefront of numerical ocean modelling\".[2] With the closure of the Institute, by then the NERC Oceanography Unit, he moved to Southampton in 1995 to build up a team at the Southampton Oceanography Centre, now the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, focusing on ocean process modelling. During these years he established the journal Ocean Modelling, which rapidly became one of the leading oceanographic journals,[2] achieving the highest impact factor of any physical oceanographic journal in 2005.[4]/nKillworth's work was marked by several awards, including a Fellowship from the American Geophysical Union in 2000; the Fridtjof Nansen Medal from the European Geophysical Society in 2002;[5] and the Stommel Research Medal from the American Meteorological Society in 2008 for his \"many important contributions to ocean modelling and theoretical oceanography\".[1] After his death in 2008, the UK National Oceanography Centre established the Peter Killworth Memorial Fund to \"provide an annual award to students to support their research, studies and professional development\" and \"to honour Peter's commitment to fostering and encouraging the careers of budding scientists.\"[1]/nKillworth was also known for his work on social networks, applying mathematical modelling to anthropological empirical research. His work in this area began in 1972, when he met American anthropologist H. Russell Bernard, whilst both men were working at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California. Bernard had been conducting research on an oceanographic ship, examining how different social actors interrelated and knew one another. Killworth proposed applying the 'Baltimore traffic problem algorithm' to the research challenges this presented.[6] Over the next few years, the partnership would work extensively on the so-called \"small world\", examining differences in the answers to questions such as \"how many people does the average person think they know?\" and \"how many people does the average person really know?\"/nKillworth's interest in social networks increasingly focused on answering challenging questions about issues on which responses from individuals in questionnaires could not be trusted or were unlikely to be reliable, and where direct empirical data was lacking \u2013 \"apparently uncountable populations\".[7] He was keen to stress the practical implications of this sort of anthropology, highlighting that before \"we decide how much money to spend on a social problem, we need to know how big the problem is. It may not matter to anyone but scientists whether the typical American knows 290 people or 2,900, but it matters a lot if we can tell whether populations like the homeless are increasing or decreasing.\"[6] Killworth was proud of his modelling's contribution to accurately measuring key issues such as the real size of the HIV+ community, or the number of rape victims in given communities.[7]/nOne academic outcome from this work was a challenge to Dunbar's number theorem. Dunbar's number theorem suggests a theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are relationships in which an individual knows who each person is, and how each person relates to every other person.[8] Dunbar's number is not derived from systematic observation of the number of relationships that people living in the contemporary world have. Killworth and his associates did a number of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties \u2013 290 \u2013 that is roughly double Dunbar's estimate. This was not an average of study averages or a theoretical hypothesis but a repeated finding.[9][10] In 1997, Killworth and Bernard formed the keynote speakers at the International Network for Social Network Analysis annual \"Sunbelt\" meeting, presenting on this accumulated work./nAlthough perhaps best known for his work with Bernard, Killworth also conducted a range of work with social network researchers Chris McCarty, Gene Shelley and Gene Johnsen.[7]/nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in Cambridge was the centre of much early interactive fiction text adventure software in the UK, using the Phoenix computer system there. Peter Killworth wrote the groundbreaking mainframe computer game Brand X with fellow mathematician Jonathan Mestel.[11] With the software arm of Acorn Computers based just around the corner from his Cambridge department, it was not long before Acornsoft acquired the rights to Brand X, which was released commercially for the BBC Micro computer as Philosopher's Quest.[11] Other games followed, including Castle of Riddles, Countdown to Doom, Return to Doom and Last Days of Doom, the latter games released through Topologika. Killworth described these games as \"unashamed puzzlefests, you can die in lots of (hopefully funny) ways \u2013 but undo will cure that \u2013 and it's very easy to get stuck.\"[12] Killworth published a book on the writing and theory of text adventure games in 1984.[13]/nKillworth also turned his hand to other programming applications, and \"worked on top RISC OS graph plotting program Tau after taking over the software from original author Tim Birks.[14] He was also a frequent contributor to the ongoing design of the EasiWriter and TechWriter packages, published by Icon Technology.[14]/nPeter Killworth was also a keen amateur magician, and a member of the Cambridge University Pentacle Club for many years.

When the Cybermen attack, she aids the Doctor and Jamie in defeating them before stowing away aboard the TARDIS.[5] In David Whitaker's script for The Wheel in Space, Zoe's last name is spelled \"Heriot\",[6] but the double-\"r\" misspelling is also seen in reference works./nZoe's age is not given in the series, but according to initial publicity she was fifteen when she joined the TARDIS crew.[7] She holds a degree in pure mathematics[4] and is a genius, with intelligence scores comparable to the Doctor's. Coupled with her photographic memory[8] and the advanced learning techniques of her era, this makes her somewhat like a human calculator, able to perform complicated mathematics in her head. Part of the reason for her wanting to travel with the Doctor is her chafing at the restrictions and sterile surroundings of her station-bound existence. However, her real-world experience is severely limited, causing her to get herself into trouble frequently./nTogether with the Doctor and Jamie, she meets the Cybermen again when they invade 20th-century London, enters the surreal Land of Fiction, fights the Ice Warriors[3] and survives the battlefields of the War Chief's war games.

She has returned as Zoe in several more Big Finish plays such as Echoes of Grey and her second Companion Chronicle, Prison in Space, based on an unmade TV story.

He was a staunch proponent of the work of Sir Isaac Newton and often used his gift for satire in Newton's defence./nJurin's father was John Jurin, a London dyer. His mother was John's wife Dorcas Cotesworth. He was educated at Christ's Hospital where he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1705, and being elected fellow the following year.[1] Becoming the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the master of Trinity, Richard Bentley, Jurin became tutor to Mordecai Cary, travelling with him internationally. Jurin achieved his MA in 1709 and became headteacher of the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle. Jurin became a frequent public speaker on mathematics and the work of Sir Isaac Newton.[2] Jurin returned to Cambridge in 1715 to study medicine, becoming MD the following year and establishing a successful practice in London and Tunbridge Wells. In 1722, he lectured on anatomy to the Company of Surgeons.[2] From 1725 to 1732 he worked as a physician at Guy's Hospital, thereafter becoming a governor of the hospital. In 1724, Jurin married Mary Douglas, n\u00e9e Harris (died 1784), wealthy widow of Oley Douglas, and they had five daughters and one son.[2]/nJurin rose to a position of some eminence in medicine and science. He is described as \"witty, satirical, ambitious, and professionally and financially successful\".[2] He was a powerful advocate of the smallpox variolation, a procedure involving scratching pus or material from the scabs of smallpox sores into the veins of a non-immune person to create a mild case of the disease that would confer lifelong immunity.  Jurin used an early statistical study to compare the risks of variolation with those from contracting the disease naturally. He studied mortality statistics for London for the fourteen years prior to 1723 and concluded that one fourteenth of the population had died from smallpox, up to 40 percent during epidemics.[3] He advertised in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for readers to report their personal and professional experiences and received over sixty replies, most from other physicians or surgeons,[2] but most significantly from Thomas Nettleton who reported his own calculations from his experience in several communities in Yorkshire.[3] Jurin's analysis concluded that the probability of death from variolation was roughly 1 in 50, while the probability of death from naturally contracted smallpox was 1 in 7 or 8. He published his results in a series of annual pamphlets, An Account of the Success of Inoculating the Small-Pox (1723\u20131727). His work was very influential in establishing smallpox variolation in England some seventy years before Edward Jenner introduced the more effective method of \"vaccination\" using cowpox material in place of human smallpox.[2] Jurin claimed that he had given \"plain Proof from Experience and Matters of Fact that the Small Pox procured by inoculation ... is far less Dangerous than the same Distemper has been for many Years in the Natural Way.\"[3]/nJurin was an \"ardent Newtonian\". He had studied under Roger Cotes and William Whiston at Cambridge but only came to know Newton at the Royal Society, where Jurin was Secretary towards the end of Newton's Presidency. Always advocating the Newtonian position, he was a keen controversialist, corresponding with Voltaire, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet. He took an active part in defending Newton and attacking Gottfried Leibniz in the debate over vis viva,[2] opposing the views of Benjamin Robins and Pietro Antonio Michelotti.[4] Jurin fostered international observational research into weather and meteorology,[2] and studied the phenomenon of capillary action, deriving the rule that the height of liquid in a capillary tube is inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube at the surface of the liquid only, a law sometimes known as Jurin's law.[5][6] He published on hydrodynamics and was critical of Jean and Daniel Bernoulli's work.[2] Jurin worked on iatrophysics, investigating the mechanical behaviour of the heart and the specific gravity of blood, debating the heart with James Keill and Jean-Baptiste de S\u00e9nac. He wrote an addendum (1738) On Distinct and Indistinct Vision to Robert Smith's Opticks and engaged in a lively epistollary exchange with Robins on the topic.[2]/nIn 1734, George Berkeley published The Analyst in which he attacked the calculus as flawed and ultimately absurd. Between 1734 and 1742, Jurin published over three hundred pages in robust rebuttal of Berkeley, many of them employing his favourite weapon of satire. The publications, some under the pseudonym Philalethes Cantabrigensis, included Geometry no Friend to Infidelity, or A Defence of Sir Isaac Newton & the British Mathematicians (1734)[7] and The Minute Mathematician, or The Freethinker no Just Thinker (1735).[8] Berkeley quickly withdrew from the debate and Jurin turned his attentions on Robins and Henry Pemberton.[2] The controversy was re-ignited years later when Jurin wrote negatively in response to Berkeley's promotion of tar-water.[9]/nJurin attended Robert Walpole as his physician and prescribed lixivium lithontripticum for Walpole's bladder stones. Jurin had used a similar prescription for himself but Walpole died and Jurin was blamed for his death, again necessitating an energetic pamphlet campaign to defend his practice.[2] Jurin died in London and was buried at St James Garlickhythe.

The name al-Mu'taman is itself a shortening of his full regnal name al-Mu'taman Billah (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u062a\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, romanized:\u00a0al-M\u016b\u02betaman bi-\u02beLl\u0101h, lit.\u2009'Trustee through God')./nAl-Mu'taman was the third king of the Banu Hud dynasty, reigning from 1081 to 1085, at the height of power of Muslim Zaragoza, following the thriving period of his father Ahmad al-Muqtadir. He continued his father's efforts and created around him a court of intellectuals, living in the beautiful palace of Aljafer\u00eda, nicknamed as \"the palace of joy\"./nAs king, Al-Mu'taman was a patron of science, philosophy and arts, and was himself a scholar of considerable accomplishment. He knew astrology, philosophy, and especially mathematics, a discipline in which he wrote the most important treatise to come out of the al-Andalus region in the 11th century,[1] the Kitab al-Istikmal (\"Book of Perfection\")./nYusuf was born on an unknown date, certainly in Zaragoza, in the palace of Aljaferia. When he ascended to the throne on the death of his father in 1081, the taifa of Zaragoza was at its peak. Al-Muqtadir divided his lands between his two sons: al-Mu'taman received the western part of the taifa with Zaragoza, Tudela, Huesca and Calatayud, while al-Mundhir received the coastal zone of the kingdom, including L\u00e9rida, Monz\u00f3n, Tortosa and D\u00e9nia./nThe first external concern of the king was the threat posed by the King of Aragon, Sancho Ram\u00edrez who aimed to extend his territories to the south, at the expense of Zaragoza. Al-Mu'taman counted on the services of the mercenary troops of the Castilian lord El Cid, who had been exiled by King Alfonso\u00a0VI for conducting raids against his interests in the Taifa of Toledo, then a tributary of the king. In 1081, El Cid therefore offered his service to the king of Zaragoza, al-Muqtadir, and remained with al-Mu'taman during his reign./nAl-Mu'taman also assigned to El Cid the task of reincorporating into Zaragoza the eastern territories of his relative al-Mundhir, an ally of Aragon. Clashes in the border area were constant, but neither managed to reunite the paternal territory./nEl Cid contained the attacks of the Aragonese until 1083, when Sancho managed to take the line of fortifications that protected Zaragoza like Graus in the east, as well as Ayerbe, Bolea, Arascu\u00e9s and Arguedas. El Cid served Yusuf al-Mu'tamin until 1086, when he broke his ties with Zaragoza. The circumstances in which he refused to continue serving al-Mu'tamin and his heir Ahmad\u00a0II al-Musta\u02bfin are not fully clear and still debated./nAl-Mu'taman also tried to strengthen relations with his vassal king of Valencia, Abu Bakr, through marriage alliances. But Valencia was entangled in a complex game of alliances. Alfonso\u00a0VI, skilfully using diplomacy, got al-Kadir, the king of Toledo, to hand over the city in 1085 in exchange for his help to drive Abu Bakr from Valencia, which meant, in fact, the capture of Toledo for the king of Castile. Thus, the kingdom of Zaragoza was cut off from the rest of al-Andalus, which seriously weakened its economy and made it even more vulnerable to Christian attacks. The year of the loss of Valencia was also the year of the death of Yusuf al-Mu'tamin./nAlthough it was common practice for royals to be well educated, both al-Mu'taman and his father were exceptional mathematicians. In medieval Islam, there was a movement dedicated to the translation of ancient Greek texts, ranging from philosophy, to medicine, to astronomy, and the more influential mathematical texts. Both father and son, as well as medieval Islamic translators such as the Banu Musa were known for their expansions on ancient Greek and Roman ideals. There was a stigma in the periods following medieval Islam that Islamic scholars only copied the ancient texts, offering no intellectual addition. Later it was proven that scholars such as Ibn Qurra and al-Mu'taman offered their own input and original contributions beyond their transmission of ancient ideas./nThe main work of al-Mu'taman was his Kitab al-Istikmal (Book of Perfection). This book was a compendium of the Greek mathematics of Euclid and Archimedes among others, but also contained the teachings of Thabit ibn Qurra, the Banu Musa and Ibn al-Haytham, and included some theorems and proofs not found in earlier extant sources. The book only persists as fragments from several anonymous manuscripts, not including any preface or introduction, but it is clear from the remaining content that the intention was to organize and comprehensively describe the known results in Euclidean geometry in a single self-contained work.[2] It is possible al-Mu'taman listed his sources in a now-lost introductory section, but none of the remaining fragments credit past authors or works for any of the content.[2]/nThe Kitab al-Istikmal was not completed but it was still seen as an important work from the eleventh-century king. The encyclopedist Ibn al-Akfani said that had the Istikmal been completed, it would have made the existing geometrical literature superfluous.[2] Ibn Aknin suggested that the Istikmal should be read by mathematicians alongside such works as the Elements of Euclid, On the Sphere and Cylinder of Archimedes, and Conics of Apollonius. Because this was not a completed piece of work it was never as widely copied or taught as the works of Euclid or Archimedes. A copy was sent to Egypt by Maimonides, and from there it spread to Baghdad in the 14th century, but did not directly influence later European mathematicians.[citation needed]/nThe Kitab al-Istikmal deals with irrational numbers, conic sections, quadrature of the parabolic segment, volumes and areas of various geometric objects, and the drawing of the tangent to a circle, among other mathematical problems. In the work appears an attempt to classify mathematics into Aristotelian categories. The classification includes a chapter for arithmetic, two chapters for geometry and two others for stereometry./nThe Kitab al-Istikmal contains the first known formulation of Ceva's theorem, which only became known in Europe after 1678 from Italian geometer Giovanni Ceva's treatise De lineis rectis. It is unknown whether Al-Mu'taman discovered this theorem himself or obtained it from another source, and it is also unknown whether Ceva rediscovered the theorem independently.[3]\nThe theorem can be stated as follows: \"Let ABC be a triangle and D, E, F points on the sides BC, CA, and AB.

He is widely regarded, in the words of 19th-century historian Montalembert, as \"the last scholar of the ancient world\".[2]/nAt a time of disintegration of classical culture,[3] aristocratic violence, and widespread illiteracy, Isidore was involved in the conversion of the Arian Visigothic kings to Chalcedonian Christianity, both assisting his brother Leander of Seville and continuing after his brother's death. He was influential in the inner circle of Sisebut, Visigothic king of Hispania. Like Leander, he played a prominent role in the Councils of Toledo and Seville./nHis fame after his death was based on his Etymologiae, an etymological encyclopedia that assembled extracts of many books from classical antiquity that would have otherwise been lost. This work also helped standardize the use of the period (full stop), comma, and colon.[4]/nSince the early Middle Ages, Isidore has sometimes been called Isidore the Younger or Isidore Junior (Latin: Isidorus iunior), because of the earlier history purportedly written by Isidore of C\u00f3rdoba.[5]/nIsidore was born in Cartagena, Spain, a former Carthaginian colony, to Severianus and Theodora. Both Severian and Theodora belonged to notable Hispano-Roman families of high social rank.[6] His parents were members of an influential family who were instrumental in the political-religious manoeuvring that converted the Visigothic kings from Arianism to Chalcedonian Christianity. The Catholic and Orthodox Churches celebrate him and all his siblings as known saints:/nIsidore received his elementary education in the Cathedral school of Seville. In this institution, the first of its kind in Spania, a body of learned men including Archbishop Leander of Seville taught the trivium and quadrivium, the classic liberal arts. Isidore applied himself to study diligently enough that he quickly mastered classical Latin,[8] and acquired some Greek and Hebrew./nTwo centuries of Gothic control of Iberia incrementally suppressed the ancient institutions, classical learning, and manners of the Roman Empire.[citation needed] The associated culture entered a period of long-term decline. The ruling Visigoths nevertheless showed some respect for the outward trappings of Roman culture. Arianism meanwhile took deep root among the Visigoths as the form of Christianity that they received./nScholars may debate whether Isidore ever personally embraced monastic life or affiliated with any religious order, but he undoubtedly esteemed the monks highly./nAfter the death of Leander of Seville on 13 March 600 or 601, Isidore succeeded to the See of Seville. On his elevation to the episcopate, he immediately constituted himself as the protector of monks./nRecognizing that the spiritual and material welfare of the people of his see depended on the assimilation of remnant Roman and ruling barbarian cultures, Isidore attempted to weld the peoples and subcultures of the Visigothic kingdom into a united nation. He used all available religious resources toward this end and succeeded. Isidore practically eradicated the heresy of Arianism and completely stifled the new heresy of Acephali at its outset. Archbishop Isidore strengthened religious discipline throughout his see./nArchbishop Isidore also used resources of education to counteract increasingly influential Gothic barbarism throughout his episcopal jurisdiction. His quickening spirit animated the educational movement centered on Seville. Isidore introduced his countrymen to Aristotle long before the Arabs studied Greek philosophy extensively./nIn 619, Isidore of Seville pronounced anathema against any ecclesiastic who in any way should molest the monasteries./nIsidore presided over the Second Council of Seville, begun on 13 November 619 in the reign of King Sisebut, a provincial council attended by eight other bishops, all from the ecclesiastical province of Baetica in southern Spain. The Acts of the Council fully set forth the nature of Christ, countering the conceptions of Gregory, a Syrian representing the heretical Acephali./nBased on a few surviving canons found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, Isidore is known to have presided over an additional provincial council around 624./nThe council dealt with a conflict over the See of \u00c9cija and wrongfully stripped bishop Martianus of his see, a situation that was rectified by the Fourth Council of Toledo. It also addressed a concern over Jews who had been forced to convert to Christianity./nThe records of the council, unlike the First and Second Councils of Seville, were not preserved in the Hispana, a collection of canons and decretals likely edited by Isidore himself.[9]/nAll bishops of Hispania attended the Fourth National Council of Toledo, begun on 5 December 633. The aged Archbishop Isidore presided over its deliberations and originated most enactments of the council./nThrough Isidore's influence, this Council of Toledo promulgated a decree commanding all bishops to establish seminaries in their cathedral cities along the lines of the cathedral school at Seville, which had educated Isidore decades earlier. The decree prescribed the study of Greek, Hebrew, and the liberal arts and encouraged interest in law and medicine.[10] The authority of the council made this education policy obligatory upon all bishops of the Kingdom of the Visigoths. The council granted remarkable position and deference to the king of the Visigoths. The independent Church bound itself in allegiance to the acknowledged king; it said nothing of allegiance to the Bishop of Rome./nIsidore of Seville died on 4 April 636 after serving more than 32 years as archbishop of Seville./nIsidore's Latin style in the Etymologiae and elsewhere, though simple and lucid, reveals increasing local Visigothic traditions./nIsidore was the first Christian writer to try to compile a summa of universal knowledge, in his most important work, the Etymologiae (taking its title from the method he uncritically used in the transcription of his era's knowledge). It is also known by classicists as the Origines (the standard abbreviation being Orig.). This encyclopedia\u2014the first such Christian epitome\u2014formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 volumes.[11]/nIn it, Isidore entered his own terse digest of Roman handbooks, miscellanies and compendia, he continued the trend towards abridgements and summaries that had characterised Roman learning in Late Antiquity. In the process, many fragments of classical learning are preserved that otherwise would have been hopelessly lost; \"in fact, in the majority of his works, including the Origines, he contributes little more than the mortar which connects excerpts from other authors, as if he was aware of his deficiencies and had more confidence in the stilus maiorum than his own,\" his translator Katherine Nell MacFarlane remarks.[11]/nSome of these fragments were lost in the first place because Isidore's work was so highly regarded\u2014Braulio called it quaecunque fere sciri debentur, \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\"[12]\u2014that it superseded the use of many individual works of the classics themselves, which were not recopied and have therefore been lost: \"all secular knowledge that was of use to the Christian scholar had been winnowed out and contained in one handy volume; the scholar need search no further\".[13]/nThe fame of this work imparted a new impetus to encyclopedic writing, which bore abundant fruit in the subsequent centuries of the Middle Ages. It was the most popular compendium in medieval libraries. It was printed in at least ten editions between 1470 and 1530, showing Isidore's continued popularity in the Renaissance. Until the 12th century brought translations from Arabic sources, Isidore transmitted what western Europeans remembered of the works of Aristotle and other Greeks, although he understood only a limited amount of Greek.[14] The Etymologiae was much copied, particularly into medieval bestiaries.[15][16][17]/nIsidore's De fide catholica contra Iudaeos furthers Augustine of Hippo's ideas on the Jewish presence in the Christian society of the ancient world.  Like Augustine, Isidore held an acceptance of the Jewish presence as necessary to society because of their expected role in the anticipated Second Coming of Christ./nBut Isidore had access to Augustine's works, out of which one finds more than forced acceptance of but rather broader reasons than just an endtime role for Jews in society:/nAccording to Jeremy Cohen's account in a Berkeley, California publication, De fide catholica contra Iudaeos, Isidore exceeds the anti-rabbinic polemics of earlier theologians by criticizing Jewish practice as deliberately disingenuous.[19]/nBut once again Isidore's same predecessor, Augustine, seems to have written of at least the possibility of Jewish rabbinical practice along that subject's content's purportedly deceptive lines in the same work cited above:/nHe contributed two decisions to the Fourth Council of Toledo: Canon 60 calling for the forced removal of children from parents practising Crypto-Judaism and their education by Christians on the basis that while their parents were concealing themselves under the guise of Christians, they had presumably allowed their children to be baptised with intent to deceive. This removal was an exception to the general rule of the treatment of Jewish children according to the 13th century Summa Theologica, \"[I]t was never the custom of the Church to baptize the children of Jews against the will of their parents....\"[20]/nHe also contributed Canon 65 thought to forbid Jews and Christians of Jewish origin from holding public office.[21]/nIsidore's authored more than a dozen major works on various topics including mathematics, holy scripture, and monastic life,[22] all in Latin:/nIsidore was one of the last of the ancient Christian philosophers and was contemporary with Maximus the Confessor. He has been called the most learned man of his age by some scholars,[26][27] and he exercised a far-reaching and immeasurable influence on the educational life of the Middle Ages. His contemporary and friend, Braulio of Zaragoza, regarded him as a man raised up by God to save the Spanish peoples from the tidal wave of barbarism that threatened to inundate the ancient civilization of Hispania.[28]/nThe Eighth Council of Toledo (653) recorded its admiration of his character in these glowing terms: \"The extraordinary doctor, the latest ornament of the Catholic Church, the most learned man of the latter ages, always to be named with reverence, Isidore\". This tribute was endorsed by the Fifteenth Council of Toledo, held in 688. Isidore was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1722 by Pope Innocent XIII.[29]/nIsidore was interred in Seville. His tomb represented an important place of veneration for the Mozarabs during the centuries after the Arab conquest of Visigothic Hispania. In the middle of the 11th century, with the division of Al Andalus into taifas and the strengthening of the Christian holdings in the Iberian peninsula, Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n and Castile found himself in a position to extract tribute from the fractured Arab states. In addition to money, Abbad II al-Mu'tadid, the Abbadid ruler of Seville (1042\u20131069), agreed to turn over St. Isidore's remains to Ferdinand I.[30] A Catholic poet described al-Mutatid placing a brocaded cover over Isidore's sarcophagus, and remarked, \"Now you are leaving here, revered Isidore. You know well how much your fame was mine!\" Ferdinand had Isidore's remains reinterred in the then-recently constructed Basilica of San Isidoro in Le\u00f3n.[citation needed] Today, many of his bones are buried in the cathedral of Murcia, Spain./nThe St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma is set to open in August 2024.[31] On 5 June 2023, the school was approved as the first religious public charter school in the United States. The lawsuit OKPLAC, Inc. v. Statewide Virtual Charter School Board was filed on July 31 of the same year by \"Americans United[...,] the American Civil Liberties Union, Education Law Center and Freedom From Religion Foundation, plus Oklahoma-based attorneys Odom & Sparks PLLC and J. Douglas Mann, [...] on behalf of nine Oklahoma residents and a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting public education in Oklahoma.\" The plaintiffs allege that providing this school with public funding is \"in violation of Oklahoma law, as well as [the] country's promises of church-state separation and public schools that are open to all.\"[32]/nIn Dante's Paradiso (X.130), Isidore is mentioned among theologians and Doctors of the Church alongside the Scot Richard of St. Victor and the Englishman Bede the Venerable./nThe University of Dayton has named their implementation of the Sakai Project in honour of Saint Isidore.[33]/nHis supposed likeness and crosier, along with that of Leander of Seville and Ferdinand III of Castile, is depicted on the crest badge of Sevilla FC./nThe Order of St. Isidore of Seville is a chivalric order formed on 1 January 2000. An international organisation, the order aims to honour Saint Isidore as patron saint of the Internet, alongside promoting Christian chivalry online.[34][35] (This honour is unofficial: the Holy See considered naming Isidore as patron saint of the Internet but has not done so.[36][37])/nContemporary researchers have criticized Isidore. Specifically, the point of contention is his work in the Etymologies. Historian Sandro D'Onofrio has argued that \"job consisted here and there of restating, recapitulating, and sometimes simply transliterating both data and theories that lacked research and originality.\"[38]/nIn this view, Isidore\u2014considering the large popularity his works enjoyed during the Middle Ages and the founding role he had in Scholasticism\u2014would be less a brilliant thinker than a Christian gatekeeper making etymologies fit into the Christian worldview. \"[H]e prescribed what they should mean,\" asserts D'Onofrio./nResearcher Victor Bruno has countered this argument. According to him, it was not the meaning of the Etymologies, or of Isidore's work as a whole, to give a scientific or philological account of the words, as a modern researcher would do. \"It is obvious that, from a material point of view,\" argues Bruno, \"Isidore's practical knowledge on etymology, geography, and history are considered outdated; his methods, from the current academic and scientific standpoint, are questionable, and some of his conclusions are indeed incorrect. But Isidore is less concerned about being etymologically or philologically right than being ontologically right.\"[39]/nTherefore, Isidore, despite living in the early Middle Ages, is an archaic or \"traditional\" thinker. Being religiously inclined, Isidore would be concerned with the redeeming meaning of words and history, the ultimate quest of religions. The same researcher also found parallels between Isidore's interpretation of the word \"year\" (annus) and the meaning of the same words in the J\u0101imin\u012bya-Upani\u1e63ad-Br\u0101ma\u1e47a.[40]/nSt. Isidore Island in Antarctica is named after the saint.", "32488598": "Edward Baylis (1791\u20131861) was a British mathematician and founder of insurance companies./nBaylis began his career as a clerk in the Alliance Insurance Office.

He wrote some of the earliest works on commercial arithmetic, and discovered an improved method for calculating square roots./nVery little is known of Ortega's life.[2] He was a member of the Dominican Order in Aragon,[2] and he taught arithmetic and geometry in Spain and Italy.[1]/nFor his work on arithmetic Ortega drew on that of Boethius and of 13th-14th century mathematicians.[1]/nA widely known[3] publication among Ortega's works was Tratado subtilissimo de Aritmetica y de Geometria (\"Most refined treatise on arithmetic and geometry\") (Barcelona, 1512). The work was published in Spain, France and Italy, and translated into several languages.[2] The Tratado was innovative[3] in focusing on the practical, in particular commercial, application of arithmetical and geometrical techniques.[2] In later editions[4] this work also introduces a novel approximation method for calculating square roots,[5] which appears to be largely based on the Pell equation and thereby the best available technique,[6] even though no general solution of this equation is known to have been found until much later.[1]/nAnother textbook by Ortega was Cursus quattuor mathematicarum artium liberalium (\"Course of four mathematical arts\") (Paris, 1516).[1]/nAnother textbook by Ortega was \"Conpusicion de la arte de la arismetica y juntamente de geometr\u00eda\"[7]", "998647": "William George Horner (9 June 1786 \u2013 22 September 1837) was a British mathematician. Proficient in classics and mathematics, he was a schoolmaster, headmaster and schoolkeeper who wrote extensively on functional equations, number theory and approximation theory, but also on optics. His contribution to approximation theory is honoured in the designation Horner's method, in particular respect of a paper in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London for 1819. The modern invention of the zoetrope, under the name Daedaleum in 1834, has been attributed to him.[1][2][3]/nHorner died comparatively young, before the establishment of specialist, regular scientific periodicals. So, the way others have written about him has tended to diverge, sometimes markedly, from his own prolific, if dispersed, record of publications and the contemporary reception of them./nThe eldest son of the Rev. William Horner, a Wesleyan minister, Horner was born in Bristol. He was educated at Kingswood School, a Wesleyan foundation near Bristol, and at the age of sixteen became an assistant master there. In four years he rose to be headmaster (1806), but left in 1809, setting up his own school, The Classical Seminary, at Grosvenor Place, Bath, which he kept until he died there 22 September 1837. He and his wife Sarah (1787?\u20131864) had six daughters and two sons./nAlthough Horner's article on the D\u00e6dalum (zoetrope) appeared in Philosophical Magazine only in January, 1834, he had published on Camera lucida as early as August, 1815./nHorner's name first appears in the list of solvers of the mathematical problems in The Ladies' Diary: or, Woman's Almanack for 1811, continuing in the successive annual issues until that for 1817. Up until the issue for 1816, he is listed as solving all but a few of the fifteen problems each year; several of his answers were printed, along with two problems he proposed. He also contributed to other departments of the Diary, not without distinction, reflecting the fact that he was known to be an all-rounder, competent in the classics as well as in mathematics. Horner was ever vigilant in his reading, as shown by his characteristic return to the Diary for 1821 in a discussion of the Prize Problem, where he reminds readers of an item in (Thomson's) Annals of Philosophy for 1817; several other problems in the Diary that year were solved by his youngest brother, Joseph./nHis record in The Gentleman's Diary: or, Mathematical Repository for this period is similar, including one of two published modes of proof in the volume for 1815 of a problem posed the previous year by Thomas Scurr (d. 1836), now dubbed the Butterfly theorem. Leaving the headmastership of Kingswood School would have given him more time for this work, while the appearance of his name in these publications, which were favoured by a network of mathematics teachers, would have helped publicize his own school./nAt this stage, Horner's efforts turned more to The Mathematical Repository, edited by Thomas Leybourn, but to contributing occasional articles, rather than the problem section,\nas well as to Annals of Philosophy, where Horner begins by responding to other contributors and works up to independent articles of his own; he has a careful style with acknowledgements and, more often than not, cannot resist adding further detail./nSeveral contributions pave the way for, or are otherwise related to, his most celebrated mathematical paper, in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1819, which was read by title at the closing meeting for the session on 1 July 1819, with Davies Gilbert in the Chair. The article, with significant editorial notes by Thomas Stephens Davies, was reprinted as a commemorative tribute in The Ladies' Diary for 1838. The issue of The Gentleman's Diary for that year contains a short obituary notice. A careful analysis of this paper has appeared recently in Craig Smory\u0144ski's History of Mathematics: A Supplement.[4]/nWhile a sequel was read before the Royal Society, publication was declined for Philosophical Transactions, having to await appearance in a sequence of parts in the first two volumes of The Mathematician in the mid-1840s, again largely at the instigation of T. S. Davies./nHowever, Horner published on diverse topics in The Philosophical Magazine well into the 1830s. Davies mooted an edition of Horner's collected papers, but this project never came to fruition, partly on account of Davies' own early death./nSome idea of Horner's standing with his contemporaries is provided by exchanges in the issues of Annals of Philosophy for July and August, 1817. Thomas Thomson, in commending to an enquirer Euler's work on algebra, is under some impression that the English translation is by Horner.[5]:\u200a86\u200a Horner writes promptly to correct this,[5]:\u200a170\u200a supposing the translation to be the work of Peter Barlow. Thomson, a professor in Glasgow, might not have known that the translation, originally published as far back as 1789, was the work of Francis Horner MP, an Edinburgh native, who had died only that February./nWhen Peter Barlow wrote, in 1845, he remembered Davies, but not Horner, asking to borrow a book by Budan (both Davies and Horner were living in Bath at the time). Barlow also had a vague recollection that the material on approximations Horner sent him related to continued fractions, rather than what appeared in the Philosophical Transactions. Horner clearly held Barlow in high regard and it would have been natural for Horner to approach him to request both books and critical advice as Horner draws attention to Barlow's article in New Series of the Mathematical Repository[6] and in his survey of approximation methods in the following volume of the Repository (bound up in 1819). The anonymous reviewer for The Monthly Review in the issue for December, 1820 writes that he has seen Horner's letter to Barlow and that the letter confirms that Horner already had his method of approximation at that date (1818)./nThe methods of both Barlow and Horner use a nesting of expressions akin to continued fractions. Horner was aware of Lagrange's use of continued fractions at least through his reading of Bonnycastle's Algebra which is also mentioned in the survey article in the Repository. Horner may have rewritten his paper either under guidance or of his own volition, with an eye to publication in Philosophical Transactions. Horner goes on to write on the use of continued fractions in the summation of series in Annals of Philosophy in 1826 and on their use in improvements they yield in the solution of equations in Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts running over into 1827; he explicitly cites work of Lagrange. Barlow's memory of events may have been confused by the appearance of this later work./nA complete edition of Horner's works was promised by Thomas Stephens Davies, but never appeared./nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:\u00a0\"Horner, William George\".

His father was the neurologist Kurt E. Moser (July 21, 1895 \u2013 June 25, 1982), who was born to the merchant Max Maync (1870\u20131911) and Clara Moser (1860\u20131934). The latter descended from 17th century French Huguenot immigrants to Prussia. J\u00fcrgen Moser's parents lived in K\u00f6nigsberg, German empire and resettled in Stralsund, East Germany as a result of the Second World War. Moser attended the Wilhelmsgymnasium (K\u00f6nigsberg) in his hometown, a high school specializing in mathematics and natural sciences education, from which David Hilbert had graduated in 1880. His older brother Friedrich Robert Ernst (Friedel) Moser (August 31, 1925 \u2013 January 14, 1945) served in the German Army and died in Schlo\u00dfberg during the East Prussian offensive./nMoser married the biologist Dr. Gertrude C. Courant (Richard Courant's daughter, Carl Runge's granddaughter and great-granddaughter of Emil DuBois-Reymond) on September 10, 1955 and took up permanent residence in New Rochelle, New York in 1960, commuting to work in New York City. In 1980 he moved to Switzerland, where he lived in Schwerzenbach near Z\u00fcrich. He was a member of the Akademisches Orchester Z\u00fcrich. He was survived by his younger brother, the photographic printer and processor Klaus T. Moser-Maync from Northport, New York, his wife, Gertrude Moser from Seattle, their daughters, the theater designer Nina Moser from Seattle and the mathematician Lucy I. Moser-Jauslin from Dijon, and his stepson, the lawyer Richard D. Emery from New York City. Moser played the piano and the cello, performing chamber music since his childhood in the tradition of a musical family, where his father played the violin and his mother the piano. He was a lifelong amateur astronomer and took up paragliding in 1988 during a visit at IMPA in Rio de Janeiro./nMoser completed his undergraduate education at and received his Dr. rer. nat. from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1952, studying under Franz Rellich. After his thesis, he came under the influence of Carl Ludwig Siegel, with whom he coauthored the second and considerably expanded English language edition of a monography on celestial mechanics. Having spent the year 1953 at the Courant Institute of New York University as a Fulbright scholar, he emigrated to the United States in 1955 becoming a citizen in 1959.[1] He became a professor at MIT and later at New York University. He served as director of the Courant Institute of New York University in the period of 1967\u20131970. In 1970 he declined the offer of a chair at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. After 1980 he was at ETH Z\u00fcrich, becoming professor emeritus in 1995. He was director (sharing office with Armand Borel in the first two years) of the Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Mathematik at ETH Z\u00fcrich in 1984\u20131995, where he succeeded Beno Eckmann. He led a rebuilding of the ETH Z\u00fcrich mathematics faculty. Moser was president of the International Mathematical Union in 1983\u20131986./nIn 1967, Neil Trudinger identified a new function space embedding which could be viewed as a borderline case of the Sobolev embedding theorem.[2] Moser found the sharp constant in Trudinger's inequality, with the corresponding result often known as the Moser\u2013Trudinger inequality.[3]/nIn the late 1950s, Ennio De Giorgi and John Nash independently discovered the fundamental elliptic regularity theory for general second-order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, in which (unlike the Schauder estimates) no differentiability or continuity is assumed of the coefficients. In the 1960s, Moser identified a new approach to their basic regularity theory, introducing the technique of Moser iteration. He developed it for both elliptic and parabolic problems, and beyond recovering De Giorgi and Nash's results, he was able to use it to prove a new Harnack inequality.[2][4] In his original work, a key role was played by an extension of the John\u2013Nirenberg lemma. Enrico Bombieri later found an argument avoiding this lemma in the elliptic case, which Moser was able to adapt to the parabolic case. The collection of these regularity results are often known as De Giorgi\u2013Nash\u2013Moser theory, although the original results were due solely to De Giorgi and Nash./nIn 1965, Moser found new results showing that any two volume forms on a closed manifold are related to one another by scaling and pullback by a diffeomorphism, so that geometrically the total volume is the only invariant of a volume form.[5] He was able to apply the same techniques to symplectic forms, thereby proving that a cohomologous family of symplectic forms are related to one another by diffeomorphisms: this is also known as Moser's stability theorem.[6] Moser also analyzed the case of manifolds with boundary, although his argument was mistaken. Later, with Bernard Dacorogna, Moser fully carried out the analysis of the boundary case./nMoser also made an early contribution to the prescribed scalar curvature problem, showing that in any conformal class of Riemannian metrics on the projective plane, every function except for those which are nonpositive arises as a scalar curvature.[7] Moser's prior analysis of the Moser\u2013Trudinger inequality was important for this work, highlighting the geometric significance of optimal constants in functional inequalities./nResearch of Henri Poincar\u00e9 and \u00c9lie Cartan in the early twentieth century had clarified the two-dimensional CR geometry, dealing with three-dimensional hypersurfaces of smooth four-dimensional manifolds which are also equipped with a complex structure. They had identified local invariants distinguishing two such structures, analogous to prior work identifying the Riemann curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives as fundamental invariants of a Riemannian metric. With Shiing-Shen Chern, Moser extended Poincar\u00e9 and Cartan's work to arbitrary dimensions. Their work has had a significant influence on CR geometry.[8][9]/nAmong Moser's students were Mark Adler of Brandeis University, Ed Belbruno, Charles Conley (1933\u20131984), Howard Jacobowitz of Rutgers University, and Paul Rabinowitz of University of Wisconsin./nMoser won the first George David Birkhoff Prize in 1968 for contributions to the theory of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, the James Craig Watson Medal in 1969 for his contributions to dynamical astronomy, the Brouwer Medal of the Royal Dutch Mathematical Society in 1984, the Cantor Medal of the Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung in 1992  and the Wolf Prize in 1995 for his work on stability in Hamiltonian systems and on nonlinear differential equations.

All of his original works are lost, though some fragments are preserved in Hipparchus' Commentaries on the Phenomena of Aratus and Eudoxus.[2] Spherics by Theodosius of Bithynia may be based on a work by Eudoxus./nEudoxus, son of Aeschines, was born and died in Cnidus (also transliterated Knidos), a city on the southwest coast of Anatolia.[3] The years of Eudoxus' birth and death are not fully known but Diogenes La\u00ebrtius gave several biographical details, mentioned that Apollodorus said he reached his acme in the 103rd Olympiad (368\u2013365 BC), and claimed he died in his 53rd year. From this 19th century mathematical historians reconstructed dates of 408\u2013355 BC,[4] but 20th century scholars found their choices contradictory and prefer a birth year of c.\u2009390 BC.[5] His name Eudoxus means \"honored\" or \"of good repute\" (\u03b5\u1f54\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03bf\u03c2, from eu \"good\" and doxa \"opinion, belief, fame\", analogous to the Latin Benedictus)./nAccording to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, crediting Callimachus' Pinakes, Eudoxus studied mathematics with Archytas (of Tarentum, Magna Graecia) and studied medicine with Philiston the Sicilian. At the age of 23, he traveled with the physician Theomedon\u2014who was his patron and possibly his lover[6]\u2014to Athens to study with the followers of Socrates. He spent two months there\u2014living in Piraeus and walking 7 miles (11\u00a0km) each way every day to attend the Sophists' lectures\u2014then returned home to Cnidus. His friends then paid to send him to Heliopolis, Egypt for 16 months, to pursue his study of astronomy and mathematics. From Egypt, he then traveled north to Cyzicus, located on the south shore of the Sea of Marmara, the Propontis. He traveled south to the court of Mausolus. During his travels he gathered many students of his own.[citation needed]/nAround 368 BC, Eudoxus returned to Athens with his students. According to some sources,[citation needed] c.\u2009367 he assumed headship (scholarch) of the Academy during Plato's period in Syracuse, and taught Aristotle.[citation needed] He eventually returned to his native Cnidus, where he served in the city assembly. While in Cnidus, he built an observatory and continued writing and lecturing on theology, astronomy, and meteorology. He had one son, Aristagoras, and three daughters, Actis, Philtis, and Delphis./nIn mathematical astronomy, his fame is due to the introduction of the concentric spheres, and his early contributions to understanding the movement of the planets./nHis work on proportions shows insight into irrational numbers and the linear continuum: it allows rigorous treatment of continuous quantities and not just whole numbers[disambiguation needed] or even rational numbers. When it was revived by Tartaglia and others in the 16th century, it became the basis for quantitative work in science, and inspired Richard Dedekind's work on the real numbers.[7]/nCraters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honor. An algebraic curve (the Kampyle of Eudoxus) is also named after him./nEudoxus is considered by some to be the greatest of classical Greek mathematicians, and in all Antiquity second only to Archimedes.[8]  Eudoxus was probably the source for most of book V of Euclid's Elements.[9]  He rigorously developed Antiphon's method of exhaustion,  a precursor to the integral calculus which was also used in a masterly way by Archimedes in the following century.  In applying the method, Eudoxus proved such mathematical statements as: areas of circles are to one another as the squares of their radii, volumes of spheres are to one another as the cubes of their radii, the volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of a prism with the same base and altitude, and the volume of a cone is one-third that of the corresponding cylinder.[10]/nEudoxus introduced the idea of non-quantified mathematical magnitude to describe and work with continuous geometrical entities such as lines, angles, areas and volumes, thereby avoiding the use of irrational numbers. In doing so, he reversed a Pythagorean emphasis on number and arithmetic, focusing instead on geometrical concepts as the basis of rigorous mathematics. Some Pythagoreans, such as Eudoxus's teacher Archytas, had believed that only arithmetic could provide a basis for proofs. Induced by the need to understand and operate with incommensurable quantities, Eudoxus established what may have been the first deductive organization of mathematics on the basis of explicit axioms. The change in focus by Eudoxus stimulated a divide in mathematics which lasted two thousand years. In combination with a Greek intellectual attitude unconcerned with practical problems, there followed a significant retreat from the development of techniques in arithmetic and algebra.[10]/nThe Pythagoreans had discovered that the diagonal of a square does not have a common unit of measurement with the sides of the square; this is the famous discovery that the square root of 2 cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. This discovery had heralded the existence of incommensurable quantities beyond the integers and rational fractions, but at the same time it threw into question the idea of measurement and calculations in geometry as a whole. For example, Euclid provides an elaborate proof of the Pythagorean theorem (Elements I.47), by using addition of areas and only much later (Elements VI.31) a simpler proof from similar triangles, which relies on ratios of line segments./nAncient Greek mathematicians calculated not with quantities and equations as we do today; instead, a proportionality expressed a relationship between geometric magnitudes. The ratio of two magnitudes was not a numerical value, as we think of it today; the ratio of two magnitudes was a primitive relationship between them./nEudoxus was able to restore confidence in the use of proportionalities by providing an astounding definition for the meaning of the equality between two ratios. This definition of proportion forms the subject of Euclid's Book V./nIn Definition 5 of Euclid's Book V we read:/nMagnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second and the third to the fourth when, if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first and third, and any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike fall short of, the latter equimultiples respectively taken in corresponding order./nBy using modern-day notation, this is clarified as follows. If we take four quantities: a, b, c, and d, then the first and second have a ratio \n\n\n\na\n\n/\n\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a/b}\n\n; similarly the third and fourth have a ratio \n\n\n\nc\n\n/\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c/d}\n\n./nNow to say that \n\n\n\na\n\n/\n\nb\n=\nc\n\n/\n\nd\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a/b=c/d}\n\n we do the following:\nFor any two arbitrary integers, m and n, form the equimultiples\nm\u00b7a and m\u00b7c of the first and third; likewise form the equimultiples n\u00b7b and n\u00b7d of the second and fourth./nIf it happens that m\u00b7a > n\u00b7b, then we must also have m\u00b7c > n\u00b7d.\nIf it happens that m\u00b7a = n\u00b7b, then we must also have m\u00b7c = n\u00b7d. Finally, if it happens that m\u00b7a < n\u00b7b, then we must also have m\u00b7c < n\u00b7d./nNotice that the definition depends on comparing the similar quantities m\u00b7a and n\u00b7b, and the similar quantities m\u00b7c and n\u00b7d, and does not depend on the existence of a common unit of measuring these quantities./nThe complexity of the definition reflects the deep conceptual and methodological innovation involved. It brings to mind the famous fifth postulate of Euclid concerning parallels, which is more extensive and complicated in its wording than the other postulates./nThe Eudoxian definition of proportionality uses the quantifier, \"for every ...\" to harness the infinite and the infinitesimal, just as do the modern epsilon-delta definitions of limit and continuity./nAdditionally, the Archimedean property stated as definition 4 of Euclid's book V is originally due not to Archimedes but to Eudoxus.[11]/nIn ancient Greece, astronomy was a branch of mathematics; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. Identifying the astronomical work of Eudoxus as a separate category is therefore a modern convenience. Some of Eudoxus's astronomical texts whose names have survived include:/nWe are fairly well informed about the contents of Phaenomena, for Eudoxus's prose text was the basis for a poem of the same name by Aratus. Hipparchus quoted from the text of Eudoxus in his commentary on Aratus./nA general idea of the content of On Speeds can be gleaned from Aristotle's Metaphysics XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius of Cilicia (6th century AD) on De caelo, another work by Aristotle. According to a story reported by Simplicius, Plato posed a question for Greek astronomers: \"By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?\"[12] Plato proposed that the seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets could be explained by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century BC./nIn most modern reconstructions of the Eudoxan model, the Moon is assigned three spheres:/nThe Sun is also assigned three spheres. The second completes its motion in a year instead of a month. The inclusion of a third sphere implies that Eudoxus mistakenly believed that the Sun had motion in latitude./nThe five visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) are assigned four spheres each:/nCallippus, a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, added seven spheres to Eudoxus's original 27 (in addition to the planetary spheres, Eudoxus included a sphere for the fixed stars). Aristotle described both systems, but insisted on adding \"unrolling\" spheres between each set of spheres to cancel the motions of the outer set. Aristotle was concerned about the physical nature of the system; without unrollers, the outer motions would be transferred to the inner planets./nA major flaw in the Eudoxian system is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by Autolycus of Pitane. Astronomers responded by introducing the deferent and epicycle, which caused a planet to vary its distance. However, Eudoxus's importance to astronomy and in particular to Greek astronomy is considerable./nAristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics,[13] attributes to Eudoxus an argument in favor of hedonism\u2014that is, that pleasure is the ultimate good that activity strives for.

He was a specialist in statistical physics, complex systems and Irish mythology.[1][2]/nKenna was born in Athlone, on the border between counties Roscommon and Westmeath, Ireland, on 27 August 1964.[5] He attended Marist College, Athlone (best leaving certificate, class of 1981) and obtained his B.A. (mod) degree in Theoretical Physics from Trinity College Dublin in 1985. He also obtained his M.Sc. (1988) from Trinity College Dublin. He completed his PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) at the University of Graz[3] under Professor Christian Lang in 1993.[6]/nKenna was an EU Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Liverpool from 1994 to 1997 and at Trinity College Dublin from 1997 to 1999. He lectured at Trinity from 1998 to 2002, when he moved to Coventry University. In 2005, he co-founded the Applied Mathematics Research Centre at Coventry and founded the Statistical Physics Group there. \nIn 2018 these joined the Fluid and Complex Systems Research Centre, Coventry University, of which \nKenna was Deputy Director.[7]/nKenna's research interests relate to field theory, statistical physics (especially phase transitions and critical phenomena) and complex systems (especially applied to  Irish mythology and other epic narratives)./nIn statistical physics, Kenna is noted for his development of scaling relations for logarithmic corrections.[8][9] Already in his PhD Thesis[10] he introduced a renormalization group basis for finite-size scaling (FSS) for logarithmic corrections at the upper critical dimension and, with Bertrand Berche, he extended this to higher dimensions in 2012.[11]\nThey proposed that universality lives at the pseudocritical point instead of at the critical point and a new form for hyperscaling, valid in high dimensions.[11] This led to the introduction of the new critical exponent \u03d9 (koppa) and its logarithmic counterpart \u03d9\u0302 (\u03d9-hat or koppa-hat)[12] to govern the finite-size dependence of the correlation length and a new form for FSS, called QFSS,[13] to replace standard prescription above the upper critical dimension.  Fourier analysis showed two regimes that control finite systems in high dimensions instead of Landau scaling.[14] The Q sector is affected by dangerous irrelevant variables and the Gaussian, or G, sector (G) is not but both are physical. The pseudocritical point resides in the Q sector while the critical point itself may be either Q or G.[15]/nFormal similarities between spin systems on lattices and on scale-free networks mean an analogy between dimensionality and power-law decay of the node degree distribution there. Logarithmic corrections at critical values[16][17] also obey the scaling relations developed by Kenna in 2006.[8][9]\nKenna's  work on percolation theory in high dimensions and spin models on annealed scale-free networks has featured in the Institute of Physics News.[18][19]/nIn 2010, with Bertrand Berche, Kenna quantified the notion of critical mass of academic research groups.[20]\nUsing data from the UK's Research Assessment Exercise 2008 and the French counterpart (AERES) they tracked how research group quality depends on the size of the group.[21][22][23] They found quality rises linearly with group size up to a point which they later identified as akin to the Dunbar number in anthropology. Critical mass, defined as the minimum size a group needs to achieve to be sustainable, is half that size.[24] Subsequently, with Olesya Mryglod and Yurij Holovatch, Kenna and Berche used scientometrics to predict the outcome of the UK's Research Excellence Framework 2014.[25][26] They found that correlations between metrics and peer review are poor and the former  cannot reliably be used to replace the latter.[27] This went some way to halting the overuse of metrics at the Research Excellence Framework 2021.[28][29][30][31]/nIn comparative mythology Kenna is noted for pioneering the usage of complex networks in the study of Irish and other mythologies. His first paper[32] on the topic was downloaded over 30,000 times in 10 years, a record [33] for Europe's flagship letters journal in physics, and resulted in considerable media coverage in international press.[34][35][36][37][38][39][40] Other major works include investigations into  the\nSagas of Icelanders.[41] Kenna's team found that whether the sagas are historically accurate\nor not, the properties of the social worlds they record are\nsimilar to those of real social networks.[42][43][44][45][46][47] The epic poems of Ossian[48] were the focus of the next subject of study with conclusions broadly in line with the view they were misappropriated from Irish sources.[49][50] The Viking Age in Ireland as portrayed in Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh was next tackled by Kenna's team.[51] They developed a measure to place hostility on a spectrum between civil war and international conflict. Their findings[52][53][54][55][56][57] quantified and supported the traditional view of the Viking age in Ireland as one of international conflict and challenged recent revisionist claims. \nA study of  the character Fraoch identified quantifiable differences between the two parts of his story, supporting the suggestion it was set to writing by two different scribes, one of whom embellished the tale.[58] \nKenna and co-workers also studied Ukrainian mythology.\nThey compared the Kyiv bylyny cycle to other prominent European epics to identify universal and distinguishing properties of its social networks.[59]\nKenna's team developed  mathematical and statistical methods to probe how a modern complex narrative - namely George R. R. Martin's epic novels, A Song of Ice and Fire - achieved broad acclaim without surrendering to the need for reductionist simplifications.[60] This and other works on narratology led to sustained media interest.[61][62][63][64]/nKenna was awarded a Council of Europe scholarship to study in Austria where his PhD was then fully funded by a grant from the Austrian Science Fund  (1990-1993).

He also held an Enterprise Ireland Fellowship while in Trinity (1997-1999). In 2004 Kenna became Member of the Institute of Physics and in 2011 he was elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. He held a number of grants throughout the years, including from the Leverhulme Trust[65]  (2010-2013) and European Science Foundation[66] (2014), to support his work on comparative mythology.

The Conway knot was determined to be topologically slice in the 1980s; however, the nature of its sliceness, and whether or not it was smoothly slice (whether or not it was a slice of a higher dimensional knot), eluded mathematicians for half a century, making it a long-standing unsolved problem in knot theory.[3][9] This changed with Lisa Piccirillo's work on the Conway knot, which completed the classification of slice knots with under thirteen crossings, as the Conway knot had been the last outstanding knot in its group fully unclassified.[2]/nPiccirillo first learned of the Conway knot problem in 2018 at a conference on low-dimensional topology and geometry.[3][10] She was a graduate student at the time and spent less than a week working on the knot in her free time to \"see what's so hard about this problem\" before finding an answer:[9][11]/nI think the next day, which was a Sunday, I just started trying to run the approach for fun and I worked on it a bit in the evenings just to try to see what's supposed to be hard about this problem./nBefore the week was out, Piccirillo had an answer: The Conway knot is not \u201cslice\u201d.[3] A few days later, she met with Cameron Gordon (mathematician), a professor at UT Austin (a senior topologist), and casually mentioned her solution. In her interview with Quanta Magazine,[11] she described her interaction with Gordon in the following way:/nAnd then the following week, I had a meeting with Cameron Gordon, a senior topologist in my department, about something else, and I mentioned it to him there.

As she put it:/nWell, I just thought it was completely ridiculous that we didn't know whether this knot was slice or not. We had a lot of tools to do this sort of thing, so I didn't understand like, why for some 11-crossing-knot this would be so difficult./nShe followed this statement up with this:/nIt was quite surprising to me. I mean, it's just one knot. In general, when mathematicians prove things, we like to prove really broad, general statements: All objects like this have some property. And I proved like, one knot has a thing. I don't care about knots. So, I do care about three and four dimensional spaces, though.

He was a mathematics professor at the University of Jena, and is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language, logic, and mathematics. Though he was largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932), Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970), and, to some extent, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951) introduced his work to later generations of philosophers. Frege is widely considered to be the greatest logician since Aristotle, and one of the most profound philosophers of mathematics ever.[16]/nHis contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics. His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn. His philosophical papers \"On Sense and Reference\" and \"The Thought\" are also widely cited. The former argues for two different types of meaning and descriptivism. In Foundations and \"The Thought\", Frege argues for Platonism against psychologism or formalism, concerning numbers and propositions respectively./nFrege was born in 1848 in Wismar, Mecklenburg-Schwerin (today part of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). His father Carl (Karl) Alexander Frege (1809\u20131866) was the co-founder and headmaster of a girls' high school until his death. After Carl's death, the school was led by Frege's mother Auguste Wilhelmine Sophie Frege (n\u00e9e Bialloblotzky, 12 January 1815 \u2013 14 October 1898); her mother was Auguste Amalia Maria Ballhorn, a descendant of Philipp Melanchthon[17] and her father was Johann Heinrich Siegfried Bialloblotzky, a descendant of a Polish noble family who left Poland in the 17th century.[18] Frege was a Lutheran.[19]/nIn childhood, Frege encountered philosophies that would guide his future scientific career. For example, his father wrote a textbook on the German language for children aged 9\u201313, entitled H\u00fclfsbuch zum Unterrichte in der deutschen Sprache f\u00fcr Kinder von 9 bis 13 Jahren (2nd ed., Wismar 1850; 3rd ed., Wismar and Ludwigslust: Hinstorff, 1862) (Help book for teaching German to children from 9 to 13 years old), the first section of which dealt with the structure and logic of language./nFrege studied at Gro\u00dfe Stadtschule Wismar\u00a0[de] and graduated in 1869.[20] His teacher Gustav Adolf Leo Sachse (5 November 1843 \u2013 1 September 1909), who was a poet, played the most important role in determining Frege's future scientific career, encouraging him to continue his studies at the University of Jena./nFrege matriculated at the University of Jena in the spring of 1869 as a citizen of the North German Confederation. In the four semesters of his studies he attended approximately twenty courses of lectures, most of them on mathematics and physics. His most important teacher was Ernst Karl Abbe (1840\u20131905; physicist, mathematician, and inventor). Abbe gave lectures on theory of gravity, galvanism and electrodynamics, complex analysis theory of functions of a complex variable, applications of physics, selected divisions of mechanics, and mechanics of solids. Abbe was more than a teacher to Frege: he was a trusted friend, and, as director of the optical manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, he was in a position to advance Frege's career. After Frege's graduation, they came into closer correspondence./nHis other notable university teachers were Christian Philipp Karl Snell (1806\u201386; subjects: use of infinitesimal analysis in geometry, analytic geometry of planes, analytical mechanics, optics, physical foundations of mechanics); Hermann Karl Julius Traugott Schaeffer (1824\u20131900; analytic geometry, applied physics, algebraic analysis, on the telegraph and other electronic machines); and the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907; Kantian and critical philosophy)./nStarting in 1871, Frege continued his studies in G\u00f6ttingen, the leading university in mathematics in German-speaking territories, where he attended the lectures of Rudolf Friedrich Alfred Clebsch (1833\u201372; analytic geometry), Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824\u201397; function theory), Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1804\u201391; physical studies, applied physics), Eduard Riecke (1845\u20131915; theory of electricity), and Hermann Lotze (1817\u201381; philosophy of religion). Many of the philosophical doctrines of the mature Frege have parallels in Lotze; it has been the subject of scholarly debate whether or not there was a direct influence on Frege's views arising from his attending Lotze's lectures./nIn 1873, Frege attained his doctorate under Ernst Christian Julius Schering, with a dissertation under the title of \"Ueber eine geometrische Darstellung der imagin\u00e4ren Gebilde in der Ebene\" (\"On a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in a Plane\"), in which he aimed to solve such fundamental problems in geometry as the mathematical interpretation of projective geometry's infinitely distant (imaginary) points./nFrege married Margarete Katharina Sophia Anna Lieseberg (15 February 1856 \u2013 25 June 1904) on 14 March 1887.[20] The couple had at least two children, who unfortunately died when young. Years later they adopted a son, Alfred. Little else is known about Frege's family life, however.[21]/nThough his education and early mathematical work focused primarily on geometry, Frege's work soon turned to logic. His Begriffsschrift, eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens [Concept-Script: A Formal Language for Pure Thought Modeled on that of Arithmetic], Halle a/S: Verlag von Louis Nebert, 1879 marked a turning point in the history of logic. The Begriffsschrift broke new ground, including a rigorous treatment of the ideas of functions and variables. Frege's goal was to show that mathematics grows out of logic, and in so doing, he devised techniques that separated him from the Aristotelian syllogistic but took him rather close to Stoic propositional logic.[22]/nIn effect, Frege invented axiomatic predicate logic, in large part thanks to his invention of quantified variables, which eventually became ubiquitous in mathematics and logic, and which solved the problem of multiple generality. Previous logic had dealt with the logical constants and, or, if... then..., not, and some and all, but iterations of these operations, especially \"some\" and \"all\", were little understood: even the distinction between a sentence like \"every boy loves some girl\" and \"some girl is loved by every boy\" could be represented only very artificially, whereas Frege's formalism had no difficulty expressing the different readings of \"every boy loves some girl who loves some boy who loves some girl\" and similar sentences, in complete parallel with his treatment of, say, \"every boy is foolish\"./nA frequently noted example is that Aristotle's logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like Euclid's theorem, a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Frege's \"conceptual notation\", however, can represent such inferences.[23] The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to Principia Mathematica (3 vols., 1910\u201313, by Bertrand Russell, 1872\u20131970, and Alfred North Whitehead, 1861\u20131947), to Russell's theory of descriptions, to Kurt G\u00f6del's (1906\u201378) incompleteness theorems, and to Alfred Tarski's (1901\u201383) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege./nOne of Frege's stated purposes was to isolate genuinely logical principles of inference, so that in the proper representation of mathematical proof, one would at no point appeal to \"intuition\". If there was an intuitive element, it was to be isolated and represented separately as an axiom: from there on, the proof was to be purely logical and without gaps. Having exhibited this possibility, Frege's larger purpose was to defend the view that arithmetic is a branch of logic, a view known as logicism: unlike geometry, arithmetic was to be shown to have no basis in \"intuition\", and no need for non-logical axioms. Already in the 1879 Begriffsschrift important preliminary theorems, for example, a generalized form of law of trichotomy, were derived within what Frege understood to be pure logic./nThis idea was formulated in non-symbolic terms in his The Foundations of Arithmetic (Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik, 1884). Later, in his Basic Laws of Arithmetic (Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903; vol. 2 was published at his own expense), Frege attempted to derive, by use of his symbolism, all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical. Most of these axioms were carried over from his Begriffsschrift, though not without some significant changes. The one truly new principle was one he called the Basic Law V: the \"value-range\" of the function f(x) is the same as the \"value-range\" of the function g(x) if and only if \u2200x[f(x) = g(x)]./nThe crucial case of the law may be formulated in modern notation as follows. Let {x|Fx} denote the extension of the predicate Fx, that is, the set of all Fs, and similarly for Gx. Then Basic Law V says that the predicates Fx and Gx have the same extension if and only if \u2200x[Fx \u2194 Gx]. The set of Fs is the same as the set of Gs just in case every F is a G and every G is an F. (The case is special because what is here being called the extension of a predicate, or a set, is only one type of \"value-range\" of a function.)/nIn a famous episode, Bertrand Russell wrote to Frege, just as Vol. 2 of the Grundgesetze was about to go to press in 1903, showing that Russell's paradox could be derived from Frege's Basic Law V. It is easy to define the relation of membership of a set or extension in Frege's system; Russell then drew attention to \"the set of things x that are such that x is not a member of x\". The system of the Grundgesetze entails that the set thus characterised both is and is not a member of itself, and is thus inconsistent. Frege wrote a hasty, last-minute Appendix to Vol. 2, deriving the contradiction and proposing to eliminate it by modifying Basic Law V. Frege opened the Appendix with the exceptionally honest comment: \"Hardly anything more unfortunate can befall a scientific writer than to have one of the foundations of his edifice shaken after the work is finished. This was the position I was placed in by a letter of Mr. Bertrand Russell, just when the printing of this volume was nearing its completion.\" (This letter and Frege's reply are translated in Jean van Heijenoort 1967.)/nFrege's proposed remedy was subsequently shown to imply that there is but one object in the universe of discourse, and hence is worthless (indeed, this would make for a contradiction in Frege's system if he had axiomatized the idea, fundamental to his discussion, that the True and the False are distinct objects; see, for example, Dummett 1973), but recent work has shown that much of the program of the Grundgesetze might be salvaged in other ways:/nFrege's work in logic had little international attention until 1903 when Russell wrote an appendix to The Principles of Mathematics stating his differences with Frege. The diagrammatic notation that Frege used had no antecedents (and has had no imitators since). Moreover, until Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica (3 vols.) appeared in 1910\u201313, the dominant approach to mathematical logic was still that of George Boole (1815\u201364) and his intellectual descendants, especially Ernst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902). Frege's logical ideas nevertheless spread through the writings of his student Rudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970) and other admirers, particularly Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951)./nFrege is one of the founders of analytic philosophy, whose work on logic and language gave rise to the linguistic turn in philosophy. His contributions to the philosophy of language include:/nAs a philosopher of mathematics, Frege attacked the psychologistic appeal to mental explanations of the content of judgment of the meaning of sentences. His original purpose was very far from answering general questions about meaning; instead, he devised his logic to explore the foundations of arithmetic, undertaking to answer questions such as \"What is a number?\" or \"What objects do number-words ('one', 'two', etc.) refer to?\" But in pursuing these matters, he eventually found himself analysing and explaining what meaning is, and thus came to several conclusions that proved highly consequential for the subsequent course of analytic philosophy and the philosophy of language./nFrege's 1892 paper, \"On Sense and Reference\" (\"\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\"), introduced his influential distinction between sense (\"Sinn\") and reference (\"Bedeutung\", which has also been translated as \"meaning\", or \"denotation\"). While conventional accounts of meaning took expressions to have just one feature (reference), Frege introduced the view that expressions have two different aspects of significance: their sense and their reference./nReference (or \"Bedeutung\") applied to proper names, where a given expression (say the expression \"Tom\") simply refers to the entity bearing the name (the person named Tom). Frege also held that propositions had a referential relationship with their truth-value (in other words, a statement \"refers\" to the truth-value it takes). By contrast, the sense (or \"Sinn\") associated with a complete sentence is the thought it expresses. The sense of an expression is said to be the \"mode of presentation\" of the item referred to, and there can be multiple modes of representation for the same referent./nThe distinction can be illustrated thus: In their ordinary uses, the name \"Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor\", which for logical purposes is an unanalyzable whole, and the functional expression \"the King of the United Kingdom\", which contains the significant parts \"the King of \u03be\" and \"United Kingdom\", have the same referent, namely, the person best known as King Charles III. But the sense of the word \"United Kingdom\" is a part of the sense of the latter expression, but no part of the sense of the \"full name\" of King Charles./nThese distinctions were disputed by Bertrand Russell, especially in his paper \"On Denoting\"; the controversy has continued into the present, fueled especially by Saul Kripke's famous lectures \"Naming and Necessity\"./nFrege's published philosophical writings were of a very technical nature and divorced from practical issues, so much so that Frege scholar Dummett expressed his \"shock to discover, while reading Frege's diary, that his hero was an anti-Semite.\"[26] After the German Revolution of 1918\u201319 his political opinions became more radical. In the last year of his life, at the age of 76, his diary contained political opinions opposing the parliamentary system, democrats, liberals, Catholics, the French and Jews, who he thought ought to be deprived of political rights and, preferably, expelled from Germany.[27] Frege confided \"that he had once thought of himself as a liberal and was an admirer of Bismarck\", but then sympathized with General Ludendorff. In an entry dated 5 May 1924 Frege expressed agreement with an article published in Houston Stewart Chamberlain's Deutschlands Erneuerung which praised Adolf Hitler.[28] Frege recorded the belief that it would be best if the Jews of Germany would \"get lost, or better would like to disappear from Germany.\"[28] Some interpretations have been written about that time.[29] The diary contains a critique of universal suffrage and socialism. Frege had friendly relations with Jews in real life: among his students was Gershom Scholem,[30][31] who greatly valued his teaching, and it was he who encouraged Ludwig Wittgenstein to leave for England in order to study with Bertrand Russell.[32] The 1924 diary was published posthumously in 1994.[33] Frege apparently never spoke in public about his political viewpoints.[citation needed]/nFrege was described by his students as a highly introverted person, seldom entering into dialogues with others and mostly facing the blackboard while lecturing. He was, however, known to occasionally show wit and even bitter sarcasm during his classes.[34]/nBegriffsschrift: eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens (1879), Halle an der Saale: Verlag von Louis Nebert (online version)./nDie Grundlagen der Arithmetik: Eine logisch-mathematische Untersuchung \u00fcber den Begriff der Zahl (1884), Breslau: Verlag von Wilhelm Koebner (online version)./nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, Band I (1893); Band II (1903), Jena: Verlag Hermann Pohle (online version)./n\"Function and Concept\" (1891)/n\"On Sense and Reference\" (1892)/n\"Concept and Object\" (1892)/n\"What is a Function?\" (1904)/nLogical Investigations (1918\u20131923).

He was the first scientist to use kites in meteorological investigations.[1]/nHe was the first Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy at the University of Glasgow./nWilson was born in St Andrews, Fife, the son of Clara Fairfoul and Patrick Wilson, the town clerk of St Andrews. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, graduating in 1733 with an MA.[2]/nHe was first apprenticed to a physician in St Andrews where he became skilled in constructing mercury thermometers in glass. In 1737, he left for London to make his fortune, He found work as assistant to a French surgeon-apothecary, which included caring for his patients. During this time he was introduced to Lord Isla who like Wilson was interested in astronomy, and Wilson constructed instruments for Isla during 1738./nAfter visiting a type foundry with a friend in London, he had an idea for making better typefaces. He and his friend John Baine returned to St Andrews in 1739, where they started a type foundry business in 1742. For example, in 1756 Wilson Greek typefaces were used to print classics of Greek literature./nIn 1744, his type foundry moved to Camlachie, near Glasgow and in 1748 he was appointed type-founder to the University of Glasgow. In the following year the partnership with Baine was dissolved. Later his sons became partners. He supplied types to the Foulis press making possible beautiful and artistic publications. Among modern typefaces, Fontana, Scotch Roman, and Wilson Greek are based on types cut by Wilson./nIn 1749, Wilson made the first recorded use of kites in meteorology with his lodger, a 23-year-old University of Glasgow student Thomas Melvill. They simultaneously measured air temperature at various levels above the ground with a train of kites. Melvill went on to discover sodium light./nIn 1757, Wilson invented hydrostatic bubbles, a form of hydrometer.[3]/nIn 1760, wiith the support of his friend Lord Isla, the 3rd Duke of Argyle, Wilson was appointed to the new chair of practical astronomy at the University of Glasgow, as the University has recently completed the Macfarlane Observatory. Wilson primarily made contributions to astronomy and meteorology, and posited that \"what hinders the fixed stars from falling upon one another\", the question that Newton had posed in his Opticks (1704), was that the entire universe rotated around its centre./nWilson noted that sunspots viewed near the edge of the Sun's visible disk appear depressed below the solar surface, a phenomenon referred to as the Wilson effect. When the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters announced a prize to be awarded for the best essay on the nature of solar spots, Wilson submitted an entry. On 18 February 1772 the Academy presented Wilson with a gold medal[4] for his work on sunspots.[5]/nThe crater Wilson on the Moon is named for him, Ralph Elmer Wilson and CTR Wilson./nHe, and his second son Patrick Wilson, were two of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE).

His tombstone is engraved with the words \"I tried\".[2]/nAbernathy, 10th of William L. and Louivery Valentine Abernathy (n\u00e9e Bell)'s 12 children,[3] was born on March 11, 1926, on their family 500-acre (200\u00a0ha) farm in Linden, Alabama.[4][5][6][7] Abernathy's father was the first African-American to vote in Marengo County, Alabama, and the first to serve on a grand jury there.[8] Abernathy attended Linden Academy (a Baptist school founded by the First Mt. Pleasant District Association). At Linden Academy, Abernathy led his first demonstrations to improve the livelihoods of his fellow students.[8]/nDuring World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army advancing in rank becoming platoon sergeant before being discharged.[4][9] Afterwards he enrolled at Alabama State University using the benefits from the G.I. Bill, which he earned with his service.[10] As a sophomore, he was elected president of the student council, and led a successful hunger strike to raise the quality of the food served on the campus.[10] While still a college student, Abernathy announced his call to the ministry, which he had envisioned since he was a small boy growing up in a devout Baptist family. He was ordained a Baptist minister in 1948 and preached his first sermon on Mother's Day (in honor of his recently deceased mother). In 1950 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[6] During the summer of 1950 Abernathy hosted a radio show and became the first black disc jockey on a white radio station in Montgomery, Alabama.[11] In the fall, he went to Atlanta University earning a Master of Arts degree in sociology with high honors in 1951.[10][6] While enrolled at Alabama State Abernathy pledged becoming an initiated brother of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity./nHe began his professional career in 1951, when he was appointed as the dean of men at Alabama State University.[12] Later in the same year, he became the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church, the largest black church in Montgomery; he held the position for ten years.[6][12][13]/nHe married Juanita Odessa Jones of Uniontown, Alabama, on August 31, 1952.[14][15] Together they had five children: Ralph David Abernathy Jr., Juandalynn Ralpheda, Donzaleigh Avis, Ralph David Abernathy III, and Kwame Luthuli Abernathy.[15][16] Their first child, Ralph Abernathy Jr., died suddenly on August 18, 1953, less than 2 days after his birth on August 16, while their other children lived on to adulthood.[16] His grandson, Micah Abernathy, is currently an American football player for the Atlanta Falcons.[17]/nIn 1954, Abernathy met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who\u00a0\u2013 at the time\u00a0\u2013 was just becoming a pastor himself at a nearby church.[14] Abernathy mentored King and the two men eventually became close friends.[14]/nAfter the arrest of Rosa Parks on December 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, Abernathy, then a member of the Montgomery NAACP), collaborated with King to create the Montgomery Improvement Association, which organized the Montgomery bus boycott.[4][6][18][19] Along with fellow English professor Jo Ann Robinson, they called for and distributed flyers asking the black citizens of Montgomery to stay off the buses.[20] The boycott attracted national attention, and a federal court case that ended on December 17, 1956, when the U.S. Supreme Court, in Browder v. Gayle, upheld an earlier District Court decision that the bus segregation was unconstitutional.[21] The 381-day transit boycott, challenging the \"Jim Crow\" segregation laws, had been successful.[22] And on December 20, 1956, the boycott came to an end.[23]/nAfter the boycotts, Abernathy's home and church were bombed. His family were barely able to escape their home, but they were unharmed. Abernathy's church, Mt. Olive Church, Bell Street Church, and the home of Robert Graetz were also bombed on that evening, while King, Abernathy, and 58 other black leaders from the south were meeting at the Southern Negro Leaders Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration, in Atlanta.[24][25][26][6]/nOn January 11, 1957, after a two-day long meeting, the Southern Leaders Conference on Transportation and Non-violent Integration, was founded.[27] On February 14, 1957, the conference convened again in New Orleans. During that meeting, they changed the group's name to the Southern Leadership Conference and appointed the following executive board: King, president; Charles Kenzie Steele, vice president; Abernathy, financial secretary-treasurer; T. J. Jemison, secretary; I. M. Augustine, general counsel.[28][29] On August 8, 1957, the Southern Leadership Conference held its first convention, in Montgomery.[30] They changed the conference's name a final time to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and decided to start voter registration drives for black people across the south.[30][31]/nOn May 20, 1961, the Freedom Riders stopped in Montgomery while on their way from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans to protest the still segregated buses across the south.[32] Many of the Freedom Riders were beaten by a white mob once they arrived at the Montgomery bus station, causing several of the riders to be hospitalized.[32] The following night Abernathy and King set up an event in support of the Freedom Riders, where King would make an address, at Abernathy's church.[33] More than 1,500 people came to the event that night.[34][35] The church was soon surrounded by a mob of white segregationists who laid siege on the church.[36][37] King, from inside the church, called the Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and pleaded for help from the federal government.[35] There was a group of United States Marshals sent there to protect the event, but they were too few in number to protect the church from the angry mob, who had begun throwing rocks and bricks through the windows of the church.[38] Reinforcements with riot experience, from the Marshals service, were sent in to help defend the perimeter.[38] By the next morning, the Governor of Alabama, after being called by Kennedy, sent in the Alabama National Guard, and the mob was finally dispersed.[35] After the success of the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Huntsville, Alabama in 1961, King insisted that Abernathy assume the pastorate of the West Hunter Street Baptist Church in Atlanta; Abernathy moved his family from Montgomery becoming the pastor in 1962.[6]/nThe King/Abernathy partnership spearheaded successful nonviolent movements in Montgomery; Albany, Georgia; Birmingham, Mississippi, Washington D.C., Selma, Alabama; St. Augustine, Florida; Chicago, and Memphis. King and Abernathy journeyed together, often sharing the same hotel rooms, and leisure times with their wives, children, family, and friends. And they were both jailed 17 times together, for their involvement in the movement.[25]/nOn April 3, 1968, at the Mason Temple, Abernathy introduced King before he made his last public address; King said at the beginning of his now famous \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech:/nAs I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about. It's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you, and Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world.[39]/nThe following day, April 4, 1968, Abernathy was with King in the room (Room 306) they shared at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. At 6:01\u00a0p.m. while Abernathy was inside the room getting cologne, King was shot while standing outside on the balcony. Once the shot was fired Abernathy ran out to the balcony and cradled King in his arms as he lay unconscious.[9][40][41] Abernathy accompanied King to St. Joseph's Hospital within fifteen minutes of the shooting.[42] The doctors performed an emergency surgery, but he never regained consciousness.[43] King was pronounced dead at 7:05\u00a0p.m. at age 39.[44]/nUntil King's assassination, Abernathy had served as Southern Christian Leadership Conference's first Financial Secretary/Treasurer and Vice President At-Large.[45] After King's death, Abernathy assumed the presidency of the SCLC.[6][25] One of his first roles was to take up the role of leading a march to support striking sanitation workers in Memphis which King and Abernathy had planned to attend before King's assassination.[46] In May 1968, Abernathy led the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, D.C.[47]/nOn the eve of the launch of Apollo 11, on July 15, 1969, Abernathy arrived at Cape Kennedy with several hundred members of the poor people campaign to protest against the spending by government on space exploration, while many Americans remained poor.[48] He was met by Thomas O. Paine, the administrator of NASA, whom he told that in the face of such suffering, space flight represented an inhuman priority and funds should be spent instead to \"feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick, and house the homeless\".[49] Paine told Abernathy that the advances in space exploration were \"child's play\" compared to the \"tremendously difficult human problems\" of society Abernathy was discussing.[49] Despite protesting against the launch, Abernathy acknowledged that he was \"profoundly moved by the nation's achievements in space and the heroism of the three men embarking for the moon\", but added that \"What we can do for space and exploration we demand that we do for starving people.\"[50] Later in 1969 Abernathy also took part in a labor struggle in Charleston, South Carolina, on behalf of the hospital workers of the local union 1199B, which led to a living wage increase and improved working conditions for thousands of hospital workers.[51]/nIn 1973, Abernathy helped negotiate a peace settlement at the Wounded Knee uprising between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the leaders of the American Indian Movement, Russell Means and Dennis Banks.[52][53][54]/nAbernathy remained president of the SCLC for nine years following King's death in 1968.[6] After King's death the organization lost the popularity it had under his leadership.[55] By the time Abernathy left the organization the SCLC had become indebted, and critics stated that it wasn't as imaginative as the SCLC led by Dr. King.[56] In 1977 Abernathy resigned from his leadership role at the SCLC, and was bestowed the title president emeritus.[6]/nAbernathy addressed the United Nations in 1971; he spoke about world peace.[4] He was also a member of the board of directors of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.[57] In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully for Georgia's 5th Congressional District seat, losing to Congressman Wyche Fowler.[58] He founded the nonprofit organization Foundation for Economic Enterprises Development (FEED), which offered managerial and technical training, creating jobs, income, business and trade opportunities for underemployed and unemployed workers for underprivileged blacks.[5]/nIn 1979, Abernathy endorsed Senator Edward M. Kennedy's candidacy for the Presidency of the United States.[59] However, he shocked critics a few weeks before the 1980 November election, when he endorsed the front-runner, Ronald Reagan, over the struggling presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.[60] Abernathy stated of his endorsement: \"The Republican Party has too long ignored us and the Democratic Party has taken us for granted and so since all of my colleagues and the latter in various places across the country were supporting the Democratic Party, I felt that I should support Ronald Reagan.\"[61] Abernathy withdrew his endorsement of Reagan in 1984, citing his disappointment with the Reagan Administration on civil rights and other areas.[62]/nIn 1982, Abernathy testified\u2014along with his executive associate, James Peterson of Berkeley, California\u2014before the Congressional Hearings calling for the Extension of the Voting Rights Act.[63]/nDocuments declassified in 2017 show that Abernathy was on the National Security Agency watchlist because of FBI leadership's hatred of the civil rights movement.[64]/nIn late 1989, HarperCollins published Abernathy's autobiography, And the Walls Came Tumbling Down.[6] It was his final published accounting of his close partnership with King and their work in the civil rights movement.[65] In it he revealed King's marital infidelity, stating that King had sexual relations with two women on the night of April 3, 1968 (after his \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech earlier that day).[65] The book's revelations became the source of much controversy, as did Abernathy.[65][2] Jesse Jackson and other civil rights activists made a statement in October 1989\u2014after the book's release\u2014that the book was \"slander\" and that \"brain surgery\" must have altered Abernathy's perception.[65][2]/nIn the 1980s, the Unification Church hired Abernathy as a spokesperson to protest the news media's use of the term \"Moonies\", which they compared with the word \"nigger\".[66] Abernathy also served as vice president of the Unification Church-affiliated group American Freedom Coalition,[67][68] and served on two Unification Church boards of directors.[69]/nAbernathy died at Emory Crawford Long Memorial Hospital on the morning of April 17, 1990, from two blood clots that traveled to his heart and lungs, at the age of 64.[25] After his death George H.

His definition applied some important analytic tools and the De Giorgi's theorem for the sets established a new tool for set theory as well as his own works.[citation needed] This achievement not only brought Ennio immediate recognition but displayed his ability to attack problems using completely new and effective methods which, though conceived before, can be used with greater precision as shown in his research works./nHe solved Bernstein's problem about minimal surfaces for 8 dimensions in 1969 with Enrico Bombieri and Enrico Giusti, for which Bombieri won the Fields Medal in 1974.[citation needed]/nHis earliest work was on the aim to develop a regularity theory for minimal hypersurfaces, changing how we view the advanced theory of minimal surfaces and calculus of variations forever. The proof required De Giorgi to develop his own version of geometric measure theory along with a related key compactness theorem. With these results, he was able to conclude that a minimal hypersurface is analytic outside a closed subset of codimension at least two.[citation needed] He also established regularity theory for all minimal surfaces in a similar manner./nHe solved 19th Hilbert problem on the regularity of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations. Before his results, mathematicians were not able to venture beyond second order nonlinear elliptic equations in two variables. In a major breakthrough, De Giorgi proved that solutions of uniformly elliptic second order equations of divergence form, with only measurable coefficients, were H\u00f6lder continuous. His proof was proved in 1956/57 in parallel with John Nash's, who was also working on and solved Hilbert's problem. His results were the first to be published, and it was anticipated that either mathematician would win the 1958 Fields Medal, but it was not to be. Nevertheless, de Giorgi's work opened up the field of nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations in higher dimensions which paved a new period for all of mathematical analysis./nAlmost all of his work relates to partial differential equations, minimal surfaces and calculus of variations; these notify the early triumphs of the then-unestablished field of geometric analysis.[citation needed] The work of Karen Uhlenbeck, Shing-Tung Yau and many others have taken inspiration from De Giorgi which have been and continue to be extended and rebuilt in powerful and effective mannerisms./nDe Giorgi's conjecture for boundary reaction terms in dimension \u2264 5 was solved by Alessio Figalli and Joaquim Serra, which was one of the results mentioned in Figalli's 2018 Fields Medal lecture given by Luis Caffarelli./nHis work on minimal surfaces, partial differential equations and calculus of variations earned him huge and lasting fame in the mathematical community, and was awarded many honours for his contributions, including the Caccioppoli Prize in 1960, the National Prize of Accademia dei Lincei from the President of the Italian Republic in 1973, and the Wolf Prize from the President of the Israel Republic in 1990.

Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason.[13] Kepler described his new astronomy as \"celestial physics\",[14] as \"an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics\",[15] and as \"a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens\",[16] transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.[17]/nKepler has been called the \"father of science fiction\" for his novel Somnium.[18][19]/nKepler was born on 27 December 1571, in the Free Imperial City of Weil der Stadt (now part of the Stuttgart Region in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 30\u00a0km west of Stuttgart's center). His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a mercenary, and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the Eighty Years' War in the Netherlands. His mother, Katharina Guldenmann, an innkeeper's daughter, was a healer and herbalist. Born prematurely, Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.[20]/nHe was introduced to astronomy at an early age and developed a strong passion for it that would span his entire life. At age six, he observed the Great Comet of 1577, writing that he \"was taken by [his] mother to a high place to look at it.\"[21] In 1580, at age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a lunar eclipse, recording that he remembered being \"called outdoors\" to see it and that the Moon \"appeared quite red\".[21] However, childhood smallpox left him with weak vision and crippled hands, limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy.[22]/nIn 1589, after moving through grammar school, Latin school, and seminary at Maulbronn, Kepler attended T\u00fcbinger Stift at the University of T\u00fcbingen. There, he studied philosophy under Vitus M\u00fcller[23] and theology under Jacob Heerbrand (a student of Philipp Melanchthon at Wittenberg), who also taught Michael Maestlin while he was a student, until he became Chancellor at T\u00fcbingen in 1590.[24] He proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skilful astrologer, casting horoscopes for fellow students. Under the instruction of Michael Maestlin, T\u00fcbingen's professor of mathematics from 1583 to 1631,[24] he learned both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system of planetary motion. He became a Copernican at that time. In a student disputation, he defended heliocentrism from both a theoretical and theological perspective, maintaining that the Sun was the principal source of motive power in the universe.[25] Despite his desire to become a minister, near the end of his studies, Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in Graz. He accepted the position in April 1594, at the age of 22.[26]/nBefore concluding his studies at T\u00fcbingen, Kepler accepted an offer to teach mathematics as a replacement to Georg Stadius at the Protestant school in Graz (now in Styria, Austria).[27] During this period (1594\u20131600), he issued many official calendars and prognostications that enhanced his reputation as an astrologer. Although Kepler had mixed feelings about astrology and disparaged many customary practices of astrologers, he believed deeply in a connection between the cosmos and the individual. He eventually published some of the ideas he had entertained while a student in the Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596), published a little over a year after his arrival at Graz.[28]/nIn December 1595, Kepler was introduced to Barbara M\u00fcller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. M\u00fcller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials\u2014who had helped set up the match\u2014pressured the M\u00fcllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on 27 April 1597.[29]/nIn the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).[30]/nFollowing the publication of Mysterium and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.[31]/nHe also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent Mysterium, among them Reimarus Ursus (Nicolaus Reimers B\u00e4r)\u2014the imperial mathematician to Rudolf II and a bitter rival of Tycho Brahe. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the Tychonic system with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.[32]/nInstead, he turned his attention to chronology and \"harmony,\" the numerological relationships among music, mathematics and the physical world, and their astrological consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the Sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting astrological aspects and astronomical distances to weather and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data\u2014just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in Prague; on 1 January 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.[33]/nOn 4 February 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe and his assistants Franz Tengnagel and Longomontanus at Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou (35\u00a0km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory from Mysterium Cosmographicum based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of Johannes Jessenius, Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on 6 April. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.[34]/nPolitical and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to Archduke Ferdinand. To that end, Kepler composed an essay\u2014dedicated to Ferdinand\u2014in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: \"In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet\" (\"There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move\").[35] Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during the 10 July eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in Astronomiae Pars Optica.[36]/nOn 2 August 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the Rudolphine Tables that should replace the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on 24 October 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.[37]/nKepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in T\u00fcbingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolf was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.[38]/nOfficially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matth\u00e4us Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost B\u00fcrgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.[39]/nIn October 1604, a bright new evening star (SN 1604) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself.[40] Kepler began systematically observing the supernova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a fiery trigon, the start of the about 800-year cycle of great conjunctions; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of Charlemagne (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor.[41]/nIt was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his De Stella Nova. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the celestial spheres were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. Kepler also attached an appendix where he discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the Star of Bethlehem\u2014analogous to the present new star\u2014would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.[42]/nOver the following years, Kepler attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini, and dealt with chronology, especially the dating of events in the life of Jesus. Around 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as Somnium [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of Somnium was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the Moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story\u2014several times longer than the actual text\u2014which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.[43]/nIn 1611, the growing political-religious tension in Prague came to a head. Emperor Rudolf\u2014whose health was failing\u2014was forced to abdicate as King of Bohemia by his brother Matthias. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim.[44]/nAlso in that year, Barbara Kepler contracted Hungarian spotted fever, then began having seizures. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in W\u00fcrttemberg and Padua. At the University of T\u00fcbingen in W\u00fcrttemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived Calvinist heresies in violation of the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return. The University of Padua\u2014on the recommendation of the departing Galileo\u2014sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.[45]/nKepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolf's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, Eclogae Chronicae, from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.[46]/nIn Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the Rudolphine Tables) were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague\u2014though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow, happening only a few years after Kepler's excommunication, is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.[47]/nHis first publication in Linz was De vero Anno (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth. He also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce Pope Gregory's reformed calendar to Protestant German lands. On 30 October 1613, Kepler married the 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger. Following the death of his first wife Barbara, Kepler had considered 11 different matches over two years (a decision process formalized later as the marriage problem).[48] He eventually returned to Reuttinger (the fifth match) who, he wrote, \"won me over with love, humble loyalty, economy of household, diligence, and the love she gave the stepchildren.\"[49] The first three children of this marriage (Margareta Regina, Katharina, and Sebald) died in childhood. Three more survived into adulthood: Cordula (born 1621); Fridmar (born 1623); and Hildebert (born 1625). According to Kepler's biographers, this was a much happier marriage than his first.[50]/nOn 8 October 1630, Kepler set out for Regensburg, hoping to collect interest on work he had done previously. A few days after reaching Regensburg, Kepler became sick, and progressively became worse. On 15 November 1630, just over a month after his arrival, he died. He was buried in a Protestant churchyard that was completely destroyed during the Thirty Years' War.[51]/nKepler's belief that God created the cosmos in an orderly fashion caused him to attempt to determine and comprehend the laws that govern the natural world, most profoundly in astronomy.[52][53] The phrase \"I am merely thinking God's thoughts after Him\" has been attributed to him, although this is probably a capsulized version of a writing from his hand:/nThose laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that we could share in his own thoughts.[54]/nKepler advocated for tolerance among Christian denominations, for example arguing that Catholics and Lutherans should be able to take communion together. He wrote, \"Christ the Lord neither was nor is Lutheran, nor Calvinist, nor Papist.\"[55]/nKepler's first major astronomical work, Mysterium Cosmographicum (The Cosmographic Mystery, 1596), was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an epiphany on 19 July 1595, while teaching in Graz, demonstrating the periodic conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the zodiac: he realized that regular polygons bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional polyhedra. He found that each of the five Platonic solids could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical orbs; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its orbital period: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.[56]/nKepler thought the Mysterium had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about the connection between the physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between them to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.[57] With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the T\u00fcbingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible exegesis and the addition of a simpler, more understandable, description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas. Mysterium was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the patronage system.[58]/nIn 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.[59] In terms of impact, the Mysterium can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by Copernicus in his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the Earth's orbit rather than that of the Sun \"as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy.\" Modern astronomy owes much to Mysterium Cosmographicum, despite flaws in its main thesis, \"since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it.\"[60]/nThe extended line of research that culminated in Astronomia Nova (A New Astronomy)\u2014including the first two laws of planetary motion\u2014began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of the orbit of Mars. In this work Kepler introduced the revolutionary concept of planetary orbit, a path of a planet in space resulting from the action of physical causes, distinct from previously held notion of planetary orb (a spherical shell to which planet is attached). As a result of this breakthrough astronomical phenomena came to be seen as being governed by physical laws.[61] Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars's orbit using an equant (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two arcminutes (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an ovoid orbit to the data.[62]/nIn Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of God the Father) was the source of motive force in the Solar System. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on William Gilbert's theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from De Magnete (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive species)[63] radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.[64][note 1] Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: planets sweep out equal areas in equal times\u2014his second law of planetary motion.[66]/nHe then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped ovoid orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in late 1604 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse,[67] which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked.[68] Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data (the Vicarious Hypothesis), Kepler immediately concluded that all planets move in ellipses, with the Sun at one focus\u2014his first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for Astronomia nova, though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.[69]/nSince completing the Astronomia Nova, Kepler had intended to compose an astronomy textbook that would cover all the fundamentals of heliocentric astronomy.[70] Kepler spent the next several years working on what would become Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy). Despite its title, which merely hints at heliocentrism, the Epitome is less about Copernicus's work and more about Kepler's own astronomical system. The Epitome contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes.[71] Although it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in Astronomia nova) to all the planets as well as the Moon and the Medicean satellites of Jupiter,[note 2] it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data.[74]/nOriginally intended as an introduction for the uninitiated, Kepler sought to model his Epitome after that of his master Michael Maestlin, who published a well-regarded book explaining the basics of geocentric astronomy to non-experts.[75] Kepler completed the first of three volumes, consisting of Books I\u2013III, by 1615 in the same question-answer format of Maestlin's and have it printed in 1617.[76] However, the banning of Copernican books by the Catholic Church, as well as the start of the Thirty Years' War, meant that publication of the next two volumes would be delayed. In the interim, and to avoid being subject to the ban, Kepler switched the audience of the Epitome from beginners to that of expert astronomers and mathematicians, as the arguments became more and more sophisticated and required advanced mathematics to be understood.[75] The second volume, consisting of Book IV, was published in 1620, followed by the third volume, consisting of Books V\u2013VII, in 1621./nIn the years following the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table, though neither would be completed for many years.[77]/nKepler, at last, completed the Rudolphine Tables in 1623, which at the time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627.[78]/nLike Ptolemy, Kepler considered astrology as the counterpart to astronomy, and as being of equal interest and value. However, in the following years, the two subjects drifted apart until astrology was no longer practiced among professional astronomers.[79]/nSir Oliver Lodge observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology in his own day, as he was \"continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but it was the only thing for which people would pay him, and on it after a fashion he lived.\"[80] Nonetheless, Kepler spent a huge amount of time trying to restore astrology on a firmer philosophical footing, composing numerous astrological calendars, more than 800 nativities, and a number of treaties dealing with the subject of astrology proper.[81]/nIn his bid to become imperial astronomer, Kepler wrote De Fundamentis (1601), whose full title can be translated as \u201cOn Giving Astrology Sounder Foundations\u201d, as a short foreword to one of his yearly almanacs.[82]/nIn this work, Kepler describes the effects of the Sun, Moon, and the planets in terms of their light and their influences upon humors, finalizing with Kepler's view that the Earth possesses a soul with some sense of geometry. Stimulated by the geometric convergence of rays formed around it, the world-soul is sentient but not conscious. As a shepherd is pleased by the piping of a flute without understanding the theory of musical harmony, so likewise Earth responds to the angles and aspects made by the heavens but not in a conscious manner. Eclipses are important as omens because the animal faculty of the Earth is violently disturbed by the sudden intermission of light, experiencing something like emotion and persisting in it for some time.[79]/nKepler surmises that the Earth has \"cycles of humors\" as living animals do, and gives for an example that \"the highest tides of the sea are said by sailors to return after nineteen years around the same days of the year\". (This may refer to the 18.6-year lunar node precession cycle.) Kepler advocates searching for such cycles by gathering observations over a period of many years, \"and so far this observation has not been made\".[83]/nKepler and Helisaeus Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks on the importance of astrology after the supernova of 1604; around the same time, physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular).[84]/nIn response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology, on the one hand, and overzealous rejection of it, on the other, Kepler prepared Tertius Interveniens (1610). Nominally this work\u2014presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius\u2014was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars (the titled meaning \"Third-party interventions\"), but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the \"evil-smelling dung\" in which \"an industrious hen\" scrapes, there was an \"occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget\" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.[85]/nKepler was convinced \"that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world\".[86] In Harmonice Mundi (1619), he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world\u2014particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects\u2014in terms of music.[note 3] The central set of \"harmonies\" was the musica universalis or \"music of the spheres\", which had been studied by Pythagoras, Ptolemy and others before Kepler; in fact, soon after publishing Harmonice Mundi, Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with Robert Fludd, who had recently published his own harmonic theory.[87]/nKepler began by exploring regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures that would come to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies\u2014and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler\u2014with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories\u2014treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.[88]/nAmong many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion. He tried many combinations until he discovered that (approximately) \"The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances.\" Although he gives the date of this epiphany (8 March 1618), he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion.[89] However, the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s. When conjoined with Christiaan Huygens' newly discovered law of centrifugal force, it enabled Isaac Newton, Edmund Halley, and perhaps Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them.[90] This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies, such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated, and also by Galileo's student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics.[91]/nAs Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations\u2014now available to him in their entirety\u2014and began the slow process of tabulating the Rudolphine Tables, Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on 1 January 1604, was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye's lens onto the retina. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected \"in the hollows of the brain\" due to the \"activity of the Soul.\"[92]/nToday, Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent).[93] With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry, Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity, thus having the properties of a large circle.[94]/nIn the first months of 1610, Galileo Galilei\u2014using his powerful new telescope\u2014discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter. Upon publishing his account as Sidereus Nuncius [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus, providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to Astronomia Nova.[95]/nKepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic lenses using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne.[96] The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as Dioptrice in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of double-convex converging lenses and double-concave diverging lenses\u2014and how they are combined to produce a Galilean telescope\u2014as well as the concepts of real vs. virtual images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope\u2014now known as the astronomical or Keplerian telescope\u2014in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.[97]/nAs a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical atomistic physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the Kepler conjecture, a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.[98][99]/nKepler wrote the influential mathematical treatise Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum in 1613, on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, which was published in 1615.[100] Kepler also contributed to the development of infinitesimal methods and numerical analysis, including iterative approximations, infinitesimals, and the early use of logarithms and transcendental equations.[101][102] Kepler's work on calculating volumes of shapes, and on finding the optimal shape of a wine barrel, were significant steps toward the development of calculus.[103] Simpson's rule, an approximation method used in integral calculus, is known in German as Keplersche Fassregel (Kepler's barrel rule).[104]/nKepler's laws of planetary motion were not immediately accepted. Several major figures such as Galileo and Ren\u00e9 Descartes completely ignored Kepler's Astronomia nova. Many astronomers, including Kepler's teacher, Michael Maestlin, objected to Kepler's introduction of physics into his astronomy. Some adopted compromise positions. Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse, while Seth Ward used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant.[105][106][107]/nSeveral astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and its various modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date. Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction.[108] This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury. However, his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables. Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe, including Paris.[109] Jeremiah Horrocks, who observed the 1639 Venus transit, had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model, predicted the transit, and then built apparatus to observe the transit. He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model.[110][111][112]/nEpitome of Copernican Astronomy was read by astronomers throughout Europe, and following Kepler's death, it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler's ideas. In the period 1630\u20131650, this book was the most widely used astronomy textbook, winning many converts to ellipse-based astronomy.[71] However, few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions. In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work\u2014notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke\u2014began to incorporate attractive forces (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of inertia.[113] This culminated in Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of universal gravitation,[114] a mathematical challenge later known as \"solving the Kepler problem\".[115]/nBeyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy, Kepler has loomed large in the philosophy and historiography of science. Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla's 1758 Histoire des math\u00e9matiques and Jean-Baptiste Delambre's 1821 Histoire de l'astronomie moderne. These and other histories written from an Enlightenment perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later Romantic-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.\nWilliam Whewell, in his influential History of the Inductive Sciences of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of scientific method. Similarly, Ernst Friedrich Apelt\u2014the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by Catherine the Great\u2014identified Kepler as a key to the \"Revolution of the sciences\".\nApelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.[116]/nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9's work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyr\u00e9, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the \"Scientific Revolution\" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyr\u00e9 placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.[117]/nPhilosophers of science\u2014such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Norwood Russell Hanson, Stephen Toulmin, and Karl Popper\u2014have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of incommensurability, analogical reasoning, falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist Wolfgang Pauli even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of analytical psychology on scientific investigation.[118]/nModern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century)./nAn edition in eight volumes,  Kepleri Opera omnia, was prepared by Christian Frisch (1807\u20131881), during 1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.\nFrisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary./nA new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856\u20131934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts./nMax Caspar (1880\u20131956) published his German translation of Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum in 1923. Both Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician Alexander von Brill (1842\u20131935). Caspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the Kepler-Kommission in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908\u20131992) and Franz Hammer (1898\u20131969), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. Max Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948.[119] The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976\u20132003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984\u20131999) and Roland Bulirsch (1998\u20132014).[120][121]/nKepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time; science popularizer Carl Sagan described him as \"the first astrophysicist and the last scientific astrologer\".[122] The debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is Arthur Koestler's 1959 The Sleepwalkers, in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution.[123]/nA well-received historical novel by John Banville, Kepler (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science.[124] A 2004 nonfiction book, Heavenly Intrigue, suggested that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data.[125]/nIn Austria, a silver collector's 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin was minted in 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.[126]/nThe German composer Paul Hindemith wrote an opera about Kepler entitled Die Harmonie der Welt (1957), and during the prolonged process of its creation, he also wrote a symphony of the same name based on the musical ideas he developed for it.[127] Hindemith's opera inspired John Rodgers and Willie Ruff of Yale University to create a synthesizer composition based on Kepler's scheme for representing planetary motion with music.[128] Philip Glass wrote an opera called Kepler (2009) based on Kepler's life, with a libretto in German and Latin by Martina Winkel.[129]/nDirectly named for Kepler's contribution to science are Kepler's laws of planetary motion; Kepler's Supernova SN 1604, which he observed and described; the Kepler\u2013Poinsot polyhedra (a set of geometrical constructions), two of which were described by him; and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing. Places and entities named in his honor include multiple city streets and squares, several educational institutions, an asteroid, and both a lunar and a Martian crater./nA critical edition of Kepler's collected works (Johannes Kepler Gesammelte Werke, KGW) in 22 volumes is being edited by the Kepler-Kommission (founded 1935) on behalf of the Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften./nThe Kepler-Kommission also publishes Bibliographia Kepleriana (2nd ed.

Hamel 1998)./n(4) However, the credibility of this [argument] is proved by the comparison of the four [moons] of Jupiter and Jupiter with the six planets and the Sun. Because, regarding the body of Jupiter, whether it turns around its axis, we don't have proofs for what suffices for us [regarding the rotation of ] the body of the Earth and especially of the Sun, certainly [as reason proves to us]: but reason attests that, just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that can go farther from it orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (sescupla ) of the proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as [is used for] the six planets above. In his [book] The World of Jupiter [Mundus Jovialis, 1614], [Simon] Mayr [1573\u20131624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four [moons] of Jupiter: 3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo)\u00a0... Mayr presents their time periods: 1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 3 hours, 16 days 18 hours: for all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of] 3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2.", "63257978": "Coralia Cartis is a Romanian mathematician at the University of Oxford whose research interests include compressed sensing, numerical analysis, and regularisation methods in mathematical optimization.

In 1950, despite protests by his colleagues, he was stripped of his security clearance.[3] He decided to return to China but was then detained at Terminal Island in Los Angeles County, California.[4] After spending five years under house arrest,[5] he was released in 1955 in exchange for the repatriation of American pilots who had been captured during the Korean War. He left the United States in September 1955 on the American President Lines passenger liner SS President Cleveland, arriving in Mainland China via Hong Kong.[6]/nUpon his return, he helped lead development of the Dongfeng ballistic missile and the Chinese space program. He also played a significant part in the construction and development of China's defense industry system, higher education and research system, rocket force, and a key technology university.[7][8][9][10][11] For his contributions, he became known as the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\", nicknamed the \"King of Rocketry\".[12][13] He is recognized as one of the founding fathers of Two Bombs, One Satellite.[14]/nIn 1957, Qian was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He served as a Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1987 to 1998./nHe was the cousin of engineer Hsue-Chu Tsien, who was involved in the aerospace industries of both China and the United States. His nephew, Roger Y. Tsien, was the 2008 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry./nQian was born in Shanghai International Settlement, with ancestral roots in Lin'an, Hangzhou, in 1911. His parents were Qian Junfu and Zhang Lanjuan.[15] He graduated from the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, with Lu Shijia as classmate, and attended National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiaotong University). There, he received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with an emphasis on railroad administration in 1934.[16] He interned at Nanchang Air Force Base./nAfter graduating from college, Qian was admitted to Tsinghua University's Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study in the United States. After a one-year study in aircraft design at Tsinghua University, he left Mainland China in August 1935 and went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a master's program in mechanical engineering.[16] He received a Master of Science in aeronautical engineering from MIT on 18 December 1936.[17][18]/nWhile at MIT, he was called Hsue-Shen Tsien. He was influenced by the methods of American engineering education, especially its focus on experimentation. This was in contrast to the contemporary approach practiced by many Chinese scientists, which emphasized theoretical elements rather than \"hands-on\" experience. Tsien's experiments included plotting of pitot pressures using mercury-filled manometers./nTheodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Qian's doctoral advisor, described their first meeting:/nOne day in 1936, he came to me for advice on further graduate studies. This was our first meeting. I looked up to observe a slight, short young man, with a serious look, who answered my questions with unusual precision. I was immediately impressed with the keenness and quickness of his mind, and I suggested that he enroll at Caltech for advanced study ... Tsien agreed. He worked with me on many mathematical problems. I found him to be quite imaginative, with a mathematical aptitude that he combined successfully with a great ability to visualize accurately the physical picture of natural phenomena. Even as a young student, he helped clear up some of my own ideas on several difficult topics. These are gifts which I had not often encountered and Tsien and I became close colleagues.[19]:\u200a309/nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n made his home a social scene for the aerodynamicists of Pasadena, and Qian was drawn in: \"Tsien enjoyed visiting my home, and my sister took to him because of his interesting ideas and straightforward manner.\"/nShortly after arriving at the California Institute of Technology in 1936, Qian became fascinated with the rocketry ideas of Frank Malina, other students of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and their associates, including Jack Parsons. Along with his fellow students, he was involved in rocket-related experiments at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory at Caltech. Around the university, the dangerous and explosive nature of their work earned them the nickname \"Suicide Squad\".[20][21] Qian received a Doctor of Philosophy magna cum laude in aeronautics and mathematics from Caltech on 9 June 1939.[17][22]/nIn 1943, Qian and two other members of their rocketry group drafted the first document to use the name Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[23] In response to the German V-1 cruise missile and V-2 rocket, he and other important US scientists developed a variety of highly effective missiles that were vital in the closing stages of World War II.[24]/nIn 1945, as an Army colonel with a security clearance, Qian was sent to Germany to investigate laboratories and question German scientists, including Wernher von Braun,[25][26] and \"to recruit German scientists for the American missile program\".[27][28]/nVon K\u00e1rm\u00e1n wrote of Qian, \"At the age of 36, he was an undisputed genius whose work was providing an enormous impetus to advances in high-speed aerodynamics and jet propulsion.\"[29] During this time, he worked on designing an intercontinental space plane, which would later inspire the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a precursor to the American Space Shuttle./nQian married Jiang Ying (\u848b\u82f1), a famed opera singer and the daughter of Jiang Baili (\u848b\u767e\u91cc) and his wife, Japanese nurse Sat\u00f4 Yato. The elder Jiang was a military strategist and adviser to Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek. The Qians were married on 14 September 1947[30] in Shanghai, and had two children; their son Qian Yonggang (\u94b1\u6c38\u521a, also known as Yucon Qian[31]) was born in Boston on 13 October 1948,[32] while their daughter Qian Yongzhen (\u94b1\u6c38\u771f) was born in early 1950[33] when the family was residing in Pasadena, California./nShortly after his wedding, Qian returned to America to take up a teaching position at MIT. Jiang Ying would join him in December 1947.[34] In 1949, with the recommendation of von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, Qian became a Robert H. Goddard Professor of Jet Propulsion at Caltech.[20] He was also appointed the first director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Center at Caltech.[24]/nIn 1947, Qian was granted a permanent resident permit,[6] and in 1949, he applied for naturalization, although he could not obtain citizenship.[3] Except for the memories of a few individuals,[3] there is no other official proof indicating that Qian had tried to apply for naturalization. Years later, his wife Jiang Ying said in an interview with Phoenix Television that Qian did not apply for naturalization at all.[35]/nBy the early 1940s, US Army Intelligence was already aware of allegations that Qian was a communist, but his security clearance was not suspended until prior to the Korean War.[36] Suddenly, on June 6, 1950, the Army revoked Qian\u2018s security clearance and he was questioned by the FBI. Two weeks later, Qian announced that he would resign from Caltech and return to mainland China, which was ruled by Mao Zedong\u2018s Chinese Communist Party.[5][37]/nIn August, Qian had a conversation on the subject with the then Under Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball, whom Qian knew personally. After Qian told him of the allegations, Kimball responded, \"Hell, I don't think you're a communist\", at which point Qian indicated that he still intended to leave the country, saying, \"I'm Chinese. I don't want to build weapons to kill my countrymen. It's that simple.\" Kimball then said, \"I won't let you out of the country.\"[38]/nAfter the firm in charge of arranging Qian's move back to mainland China tipped off U.S. Customs that some of the papers encountered among his possessions were marked \"Secret\" or \"Confidential\", U.S. officials seized them from a Pasadena warehouse. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a warrant for Qian's arrest on August 25. Qian claimed that the security-stamped documents were mostly written by himself and had outdated classifications, adding that, \"There were some drawings and logarithm tables, etc., which someone might have mistaken for codes.\"[39] Included in the material was a scrapbook with news clippings about the trials of those charged with atomic espionage, such as Klaus Fuchs.[40] Subsequent examination of the documents showed they contained no classified material.[6]/nWhile at Caltech, Qian had secretly attended meetings with J. Robert Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, Jack Parsons, and Frank Malina that were organized by the Russian-born Jewish chemist Sidney Weinbaum and called Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party.[41]  Weinbaum's trial commenced on 30 August and both Frank Oppenheimer and Parsons testified against him.[42] Weinbaum was convicted of perjury and sentenced to four years.[43] Qian was taken into custody on 6 September 1950, for questioning[6] and for two weeks was detained at Terminal Island, a low-security United States federal prison near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach./nWhen Qian had returned from mainland China with his new bride in 1947, he had answered \"no\" on an immigration questionnaire that asked if he ever had been a member of an organization advocating overthrow of the U.S. Government by force. This, together with an American Communist Party document from 1938 with Qian's name on it, was used to argue that Qian was a national security threat. Prosecutors also cited a cross-examination session where Qian said, \"I owe allegiance to the people of mainland China\" and would \"certainly not\" let the United States government make his decision for him as to whom he would owe allegiance to in the event of a conflict between the U.S. and communist China.[44]/nOn 26 April 1951, Qian was declared subject to deportation and forbidden from leaving Los Angeles County without permission, effectively placing him under house arrest.[45]/nDuring this time, Qian wrote Engineering Cybernetics, which was published by McGraw Hill in 1954. The book deals with the practice of stabilizing servomechanisms. In its 18 chapters, it considers non-interacting controls of many-variable systems, control design by perturbation theory, and von Neumann's theory of error control (chapter 18). Ezra Krendel reviewed[46] the book, stating that it is \"difficult to overstate the value of Qian's book to those interested in the overall theory of complex control systems.\" Evidently, Qian's approach is primarily practical, as Krendel notes that for servomechanisms, the \"usual linear design criterion of stability is inadequate and other criteria arising from the physics of the problem must be used.\"/nQian became the subject of five years of secret diplomacy and negotiation between the U.S. and Mainland China. During this time, he lived under constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any classified research duties.[5] Qian received support from his colleagues at Caltech during his incarceration, including president Lee DuBridge, who flew to Washington to argue Qian's case. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian./nThe travel ban on Qian was lifted on August 4, 1955,[6] and he resigned from Caltech shortly thereafter. With President Dwight Eisenhower personally agreeing, Qian departed from Los Angeles for Hong Kong aboard the SS\u00a0President Cleveland in September 1955 amidst rumors that his release was a swap for 11 U.S. airmen held captive by communist China since the end of the Korean War.[47][48][49] Qian arrived at Hong Kong on 8 October 1955, and entered Mainland China via the Kowloon\u2013Canton Railway later that day./nUnder Secretary Kimball, who had tried for several years to keep Qian in the U.S., commented on his treatment: \"It was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a communist than I was, and we forced him to go.\"[3]/nUpon his return, Qian began a remarkably successful career in rocket science, boosted by the reputation he garnered for his past achievements as well as Chinese state support for his nuclear research. He led, and eventually became the father of, the Chinese missile program, which constructed the Silkworm missiles,[50] the Dongfeng ballistic missiles and the Long March space rockets./nIn October 1956, he became the director of the Fifth Academy of the Ministry of National Defense, tasked with ballistic missile and nuclear weapons development./nQian's reputation as a prominent scientist who was caught up in the red scare in the United States gave him considerable influence in the era of Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong and afterward. Qian eventually rose through Party ranks to become a Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party member. He became associated with the China's Space Program - From Conception to Manned Spaceflight initiative./nTianyu Fang wrote about Xuesen's relationship with Chinese officials as a struggle for survival:[51]/n1955 wasn't exactly the best year to settle down permanently in Beijing. American paranoia had forced Tsien into a situation where he now had to repeatedly profess loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party to survive. Tsien, a foreign-trained intellectual from an affluent household who was married to the daughter of a Kuomintang official, had to constantly reaffirm his unswerving loyalty as Red Guards conducted a witch hunt for counterrevolutionaries during the Cultural Revolution./nIn 1958 Xuesen wrote an article with \"scientific\" support of Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward.[50] In 1989, after the Tiananmen massacre, he \"denounced the demonstrators as 'evil elements' and, in line with prevailing orthodoxy, branded the dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi 'the scum of the nation'.\"[52] Xuesen views were described as \"political opportunism\" that sometimes failed him, when he \"praised\" Lin Biao, close associate of Mao Zedong, who after Mao's death was killed during an attempt to flee to the USSR. Xuesen also criticized Deng Xiaoping for his \"counterrevolutionary revisionism\".[51]/nQian was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957, a lifelong honor granted to Chinese scientists who have made significant advancements in their field. He organized scientific seminars and dedicated some of his time to training successors for his positions.[53]/nHe was heavily involved in the establishment of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1958 and served as the Chairman of the Department of Modern Mechanics of the university for a number of years./nIn 1969, Qian was one of a group of scientists who spoke with Australian journalist Francis James, describing China's first seven nuclear tests and details of a gaseous diffusion plant near Lanzhou.[27][28]/nOutside of rocketry, Qian had a presence in numerous areas of study. He was among the creators of systematics, and made contributions to science and technology systems, somatic science, engineering science, military science, social science, the natural sciences, geography, philosophy, literature and art, and education. His advancements in the concepts, theories, and methods of the system science field include studying the open complex giant system.[54][55] Additionally, he helped establish the Chinese school of complexity science./nFrom the 1980s onward, Qian had advocated the scientific investigation of traditional Chinese medicine, qigong, and the pseudoscientific concept of \"special human body functions\". He particularly encouraged scientists to accumulate observational data on qigong so that \"future scientific theories could be established\".[56][57]/nQian retired in 1991 and lived quietly in Beijing, refusing to speak to Westerners.[58]/nIn 1979, Qian was awarded Caltech's Distinguished Alumni Award for his achievements. Qian eventually received his award from Caltech, and with the help of his friend Frank Marble, brought it to his home in a widely covered ceremony. Furthermore, in the early 1990s, the filing cabinets containing Qian's research work were offered to him by Caltech./nQian was invited to visit the US by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics after the normalization of the Sino-US relationship, but he refused the invitation, having wanted a formal apology for his detention. In a reminiscence published in 2002, Marble stated that he believed Qian had \"lost faith in the American government\" but that he had \"always had very warm feelings for the American people.\"[59] Despite this, Xuesen approved the decision of both his children, US citizens by birth, to return to the US to study.[52]/nThe Chinese government launched its manned space program in 1992, reportedly with some help from Russia due to their extended history in space. Qian's research was used as the basis for the Long March rocket, which successfully launched the Shenzhou 5 mission in October 2003. The elderly Qian was able to watch China's first manned space mission on television from his hospital bed./nPremier Wen Jiabao visited Qian in 2005.[60]:\u200a119\u200a Qian posed what became known as Qian Xuesen's Question: \"So many students have been educated in these years. None of them is comparable with those masters educated during the period of the RoC in terms of academic achievements. Why cannot our universities educate outstanding talent?\"[60]:\u200a119\u200a Qian Xuesen's Question was widely reported and debated, becoming an important element in public debates on education and innovation in China.[60]:\u200a119/nIn 2008, he was named Aviation Week & Space Technology Person of the Year. The recognition was not intended as an honor, but is given to the person judged to have the greatest impact on aviation in the past year.[29][61] Furthermore, that year China Central Television named Qian as one of the eleven most inspiring people in China.[62]/nOn 31 October 2009, Qian died at the age of 97 in Beijing from lung illness.[63][64]/nA Chinese film production, Hsue-shen Tsien, directed by Zhang Jianya and starring Chen Kun as Qian, was simultaneously released in Asia and North America on 11 December 2011,[65] and on 2 March 2012, it was released in China./nAfter his retirement in 1991, Qian received numerous honorary titles in China, was highly praised in press and by party officials, that was even called \"Qian Xuesen fever\". Ning Wang describes it as Chinese propaganda campaign \"to commend and eulogize\" Qian's life. In 1989, public movement \"learn from Qian Xuesen\" was officially launched by the Commission of Science for National Defence, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Association of Science and Technology. Qian received honorary titles \"State Scientist of Outstanding Contribution\", got a \"Medal for the First Class Heroic Model\", and was called by state leaders \"the People's Scientist\", \"National Hero\" and \"the Pillar of the State\". For his 90th birthday in 2001, celebrations and praising were \"comparable with that for Deng Xiaoping during 1992\u201397\".[67]/nWang writes that heroization of Qian was made for several purposes: his \"deep engagement in China's national defence programmes\", \"allegiance to the Party and his well-articulated commitment to state ideology\", \"rapid emergence of Chinese anti-Americanism\", and to create a role model of a \"party scientist\". Wang writes that in the 1990s, students \"claimed to appreciate Qian's scientific accomplishments and the significance of science and technology, taking him as a model and swearing to study hard to be the 'next Qian Xuesen'.\"[67]/nQian himself tried to avoid publicity, and did not allow writing his biography until he got the title of \"State Scientist\". During this heroization campaigns, multiple official and unofficial biographies were published. 'Official' biographies were written by Qian's secretaries by party requests. Wang Shouyun wrote A Biography of Qian Xuesen in 1991, Tu Yuanji published another book in 2002. 'Unofficial' biographies are based on these two books, and were published by Wang Wenhua, Qi Shuying, and Hu Shihong, among others.[67] All the biographies lack references to source material; Wang describes all the Chinese biographies of Qian as following:[67]/nFrom these multifarious biographies we learn that Qian was a prodigy, a scientific genius from the outset. He was gifted with a golden mind in mathematics and displayed multiple talents at young age \u2013 such as memorizing hundred of poems when he was three \u2013 and was good at music and painting when growing up. In MIT and Caltech, Qian was brighter than his classmates and surprised professors with the intelligence of Chinese youth. He was particularly good at playing darts in childhood, which presaged his talent in rocketry. ... These narratives create a near-miraculous Qian, with a strong impression that he was not only a missile expert, but an all-rounder; not only a scientific giant, but a built-in communist revolutionary.", "21839253": "Samuel Jeake (1623\u20131690), dubbed the Elder to distinguish him from his son,  was an English merchant, nonconformist, antiquary and astrologer from Rye, East Sussex, England./nBorn at Rye in Sussex, on 9 October 1623, he may have belonged to one of the French Protestant families who settled in the county at the end of the 16th century: the name Jeake, written also Jake, Jaque, Jeakes, and Jacque, does point to a French origin. Samuel's father was a baker. His mother, a pious woman, was daughter of the Rev. John Pearson of Peasmarsh, Sussex; she died 20 November 1639.[1]/nIn 1640 Samuel severed his connection with the Church of England, and was appointed minister of a conventicle, apparently Baptist. He later became an attorney-at-law at Rye, and in 1651 was made a freeman and common, or town, clerk. This office he resigned, or was deprived of, after the passing of the Corporation Act 1661 excluding dissenters from municipal corporations.[1]/nAs a sectarian preacher, Jeake frequently clashed with the authorities. He was prosecuted before the privy council in 1681, and his meeting-house was shut up. Next year he was again delated, under the Five Mile Act. Brought to London, he remained there till 1687, when the toleration which James II of England extended to the dissenters enabled him to return to Rye. There he took part in meetings till his death, on 3 October 1690.[1]/nJeake dabbled in alchemy, and made a calculation of his own horoscope. He had a large library, and compiled a catalogue. Remains of a storehouse built by him, and of a horoscope on the front, survived in Mermaid Street, Rye.[1]/nJeake is primarily known for his extensive diaries, which are today considered a valuable historical resource. Jeake also wrote on mathematics, and made the first recorded use of the terms \"addend\",[2] \"cosecant\",[3] and \"proper fraction\".[4]/nHis principal mathematical work was Logisticelogia, or Arithmetick Surveighed and Reviewed published  in four books in 1696. This was edited by his son Samuel Jeake, the younger (1652\u20131699).[6]/nJeake was a nonconformist, but disliked presbyterians as much as the established church; and he spoke contemptuously of the Independents as \"Babell, from the differences that have happened among the master-builders\". He wrote voluminously on theological controversy, astrology, and antiquarian subjects, but published nothing himself. While town-clerk, he bought a collection of statutes referring to the Cinque ports, which belonged to the borough of Rye. This was the foundation of his major work on The Charters of the Cinque Ports, two Ancient Towns, and their Members. Translated into English, with Annotations, Historical and Critical, thereupon.

He moved to the University of Saragossa, where he found a stimulating environment in mathematics.  Zoel Garc\u00eda de Galdeano, Professor of Analytical Geometry and Calculus, was the professor who most influenced Rey Pastor\u2019s scientific work. He graduated with honors in 1908. Rey Pastor earned his doctorate from Complutense University of Madrid in 1909, under supervision of Eduardo Torroja Caball\u00e9. Between 1911 and 1914, he studied at the University of Berlin and the University of G\u00f6ttingen, under the supervision of Felix Klein. During that period, he also studied under the supervision of Professors Hermann Schwarz, Friedrich Hermann Schottky (father of Walter Schottky), and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius.[1]/nHis report sent to the Junta para Ampliaci\u00f3n de Estudios (JAE) allows us to assess the significance of his studies in Germany.  He especially liked Schwarz\u2019s lectures on analytic functions and synthetic geometry, not only because of their innovations but also because Schwarz\u2019s teaching method. In this report, Rey proposed the creation of a \"seminar in mathematics to arouse the research spirit of our school children.\" His proposal was accepted and in 1915 the JAE created the Mathematics Laboratory and Seminar, an important institution for the development of research on this field in Spain./nUndoubtedly, the creation of the laboratory was a result of Rey Pastor\u2019s studies in Germany, and it was intended to overcome the isolation and individualism of the Spanish mathematicians. This laboratory, under the National Institute of Sciences, was first installed in the basement of the National Library, then moved to a modest apartment on Santa Teresa St., then to the building of the Center for Historical Studies and, finally, became part of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC), renamed Instituto Jorge Juan de Matem\u00e1ticas in 1939./nRey Pastor\u2019s scientific work involved research, textbooks, and articles for the general public. They reflected the changes that were taking place in mathematics. He was also interested in the history of science and, specifically, mathematics in Spain./nIn 1951, he was appointed director of the Instituto Jorge Juan de Matem\u00e1ticas in the CSIC. His plans in Spain included two projects: the creation, within the CSIC, of an Institute of Applied Mathematics, and the foundation of a Seminar on the History of Science at the university./nIn 1954, he entered the Royal Spanish Academy, proposed by Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, and Francisco Javier S\u00e1nchez Cant\u00f3n, and delivered an acceptance speech on the algebra of language. (He had become a member of the Academy of Sciences in Madrid in 1920, and of the Academy of Sciences in Buenos Aires in 1932)./nRey Pastor showed his passion for mathematics as a researcher, as promoter of new studies, and as creator of agencies and institutions that enhanced the development of mathematics in Spain. A lunar crater Faraday G was called Reypastor by Hugh Percy Wilkins and Antonio Paluzie-Borrell, mappers of Earth's Moon, but the designation was not adopted by the International Astronomical Union.[3]/nIn 1956, he went back to Argentina and only returned to Spain on the occasion of the entry of his disciple, Sixto R\u00edos into the Academy of Sciences, on June 21, 1961. In his speech, Rey Pastor recalled the process of creation of the laboratory and the support from the JAE./nRey Pastor occupied a seat in the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola between 1953 and 1962.

He is also known by his Latin name Scepperus./nHe was born in Nieuwpoort, Flanders probably in 1503. His father was Jan or Jacob de Schepper, the mayor of Dunquerke, and his mother Gislaine de Severin. His grandfather Jan was vice-admiral of Flanders and had an active military career fighting the English and the French. While the family name was originally the Flemish 'de Dobbele' or, in Latin: 'Duplicius' (meaning 'Double'), the honorific 'de Schepper' (the Captain) was later added because of the naval exploits of the grandfather.[1]/nCornelis received his initial schooling from his uncle L. de Schepper, pastor of Ekelsbeke, near Cassel.[2] He attended lectures at the Paris University where he studied under G\u00e9rard Roussel, a member of the circle of Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples. In December 1522 Schepper matriculated at the Collegium Trilingue of Louvain where he likely started his friendship with Goclenius, Viglius, Vives and other humanists from Bruges. He also studied philosophy, jurisprudence and mathematics.  He published in 1523 in Antwerp a mathematical treatise entitle Assertionis fidei adversus astrologos sive de significationibus coniunctionum superiorum planetarum anni 1524, which established his reputation in this field.[1]/nIt was possibly through an introduction from Fevyn and Cranevelt, that in 1523 he entered the service of Christian II of Denmark, the exiled brother-in-law of Emperor Charles V./nInitially de Schepper worked as secretary to Godschalk Ericksen, Christian's chancellor, and a few months later he became Christian's vice-chancellor. As part of the Danish royal retinue he travelled to England during the summer of 1523 and at the end of that year to Wittenberg where they met Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. While staying at Wittenberg, de Schepper published a couple of pamphlets to defend Christian's claims against Fredrick of Holstein and the City of Lubeck who had joined the king's opponents to remove him from the throne./nIn December 1524 the Danish King sent de Schepper to Spain to request Emperor Charles support in his attempt to recover the throne of Denmark. On his way to Spain de Schepper stopped in England to continue to advance the royal Danish cause with Henry VIII and Wolsey. It was probably during his stay in Spain that he first encountered his lifelong friends Johannes Dantiscus, the Polish ambassador at the imperial court, and Alfonso de Vald\u00e9s, the Latin secretary at the imperial chancellery./nHe returned to the Low Countries in time to comfort Isabella of Austria, the wife of Christian II and sister of Charles V, on her deathbed on the 19th of January 1526 at Zwijnarden, near Ghent. He wrote an epitaph for her tomb and an elegy which well expresses his deep sense of affection for the royal couple.[3] Following Isabella's death, he felt that as a Flemish he should rather try to enter the Emperor's service so during the spring of 1526 he probably travelled back to Spain and became close to the Imperial Chancellor Mercurino di Gattinara./nIn 1527 he accompanied Gattinara during his trip to Italy and in 1528 undertook his first embassy to the Polish King. As part of Gattinara's entourage, he attended the Emperor's coronation in Bologna in February 1530.  In April Emperor Charles V appointed de Schepper as general inquisitor of the Low Countries. De Schepper, in turn, employed Jean Vuystinck as inquisitor for Flanders. Vuystinck started to systematically arrest Jews of Portuguese origin and the whole episode damaged de Schepper's relationship with the Emperor./nAfter Gattinara's death, Vald\u00e9s and de Schepper attended the Diet of Augsburg where they participated in some conciliatory negotiations with Lutheran representatives such as Philip Melanchthon and Justus Jonas, although they failed to produce any agreement./nIn 1531 and 1532 de Schepper contributed to the Lutheran reformation debate as to the Emperor's envoy during several missions to Switzerland, Germany, Bohemia and Poland./nIn 1533 he joined Ferdinand's ambassador Jeronimo de Zara in a peace mission to Constantinople where they met Suleiman the Magnificent and his Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pascha, as well as the Venetian Alvise Gritti who was held in high esteem by the Turkish emperor at that time.  Zara and de Schepper managed to successfully conclude a peace treaty with the Turks on behalf of King Ferdinand. The Flemish artist Pieter Coecke van Aelst also joined de Schepper's party to Constantinople in the hope of convincing the Turkish sultan to give him commissions for tapestries.[4] After his return from Constantinople, he travelled via Old Serbia (where he visited Mile\u0161eva Monastery on 11 August 1533)[5] to Spain to report on his mission to the Emperor. Charles asked him to return to Turkey this time as an Imperial envoy but his second mission in 1534 did not achieve much. The mood at the Ottoman court had shifted following pressures on the Persian border, and both the Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pascha and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alvise Gritti were starting to lose their influence with Suleiman. Nevertheless, the Emperor rewarded de Schepper's efforts with an appointment as Ma\u00eetre des Requ\u00eates of the Privy Council of the Habsburg Netherlands./nIn 1536 a new war broke between Francis I of France and Emperor Charles V. De Schepper participated in several missions to achieve a peace agreement and was part of the team that under Nicolas de Perrenot's leadership prepared the peace summit between Francis and Charles in Nice. He attended the summit in June 1538 and in 1539 negotiated with the French King permission for the Emperor's journey from Spain to the Low Countries through France./nIn 1541, the governess of the Low Countries Mary of Hungary appointed de Schepper as her ambassador to the French court. By 1542 he was back in the Low Countries and conducted numerous missions for Mary of Hungary to support her policies towards the German princes as well as her efforts to build war defences. In 1545 he travelled several times to England to help conclude a peace treaty between Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France. In 1550 he participated in an attempt to smuggle Mary Tudor out of England to the safety of the Habsburg dominions but the whole operation failed when she refused to leave./nBetween 1550 and 1555 de Schepper acted as commissioner of the Netherlands fleet beside the Admiral Maximilian of Burgundy. He became the most important maritime expert of the central government of the Netherlands in Brussels and can be regarded as the first naval policymaker of the Habsburg government in the Netherlands. The admiral and the state councillor worked closely together and, under the leadership of the regent, they were responsible for the implementation of the maritime policy of the Habsburg Netherlands for several years. Maximilian of Burgundy and de Schepper corresponded with Mary of Hungary during periods of war on an almost daily basis to keep her informed about the activities at sea and to issue recommendations.[6]/nLate 1550 or early 1551, de Schepper fell from his horse and was badly injured.  The accident left him lame and scarcely able to move on two crutches. He died on 28 March 1555 in Antwerp, aged 52 years./nDe Schepper married twice. His first wife was Elisabeth Donche who died on 20 August 1549 at the age of 51. They had together a daughter called Anne.  De Schepper's second wife was Marguerite Loonis with whom he had no children./nDe Schepper spoke many languages and was highly appreciated in humanist circles.  Erasmus wrote in the Ciceronian that \u201cNot only is de Schepper knowledgeable in all kinds of branches of science, but he also has literary talents in prose and poetry\u201d./nAlfonso de Vald\u00e9s, Johannes Dantiscus and Viglius, the Flemish statesman and jurist, were some of his closest friends. De Schepper had an extensive network of correspondents that included Erasmus, Goclenius, Olahus, Melanchthon and Bovelles./nLike many of his contemporaries de Schepper had a keen interest in astrology. In 1524 he published \u201cAssertionis fidei adversus astrologos sive de significationibus coniunctionum superiorum planetarum anni 1524\u201d, an extensive contribution to the widespread debate that was instigated by predictions of catastrophic floods following the Great Conjunction of 1524./nDe Schepper is the author of works of poetry, astronomy and history.

By the time he was 11, his ambition was to become a mathematician.[10][11] After leaving sixth form, he studied mathematics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.[9] A \"terribly introverted adolescent\" in school, he took his admission to Cambridge as an opportunity to transform himself into an extrovert, a change which would later earn him the nickname of \"the world's most charismatic mathematician\".[12][13]/nConway was awarded a BA in 1959 and, supervised by Harold Davenport, began to undertake research in number theory. Having solved the open problem posed by Davenport on writing numbers as the sums of fifth powers, Conway began to become interested in infinite ordinals.[11] It appears that his interest in games began during his years studying the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, where he became an avid backgammon player, spending hours playing the game in the common room.[7]/nIn 1964, Conway was awarded his doctorate and was appointed as College Fellow and Lecturer in Mathematics at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.[14]/nAfter leaving Cambridge in 1986, he took up the appointment to the John von Neumann Chair of Mathematics at Princeton University.[14] There, he won the school's Pi Day pie-eating contest.[15]/nConway's career was intertwined with that of Martin Gardner. When Gardner featured Conway's Game of Life in his Mathematical Games column in October 1970, it became the most widely read of all his columns and made Conway an instant celebrity.[16][17] Gardner and Conway had first corresponded in the late 1950s, and over the years Gardner had frequently written about recreational aspects of Conway's work.[18] For instance, he discussed Conway's game of Sprouts (July 1967), Hackenbush (January 1972), and his angel and devil problem (February 1974). In the September 1976 column, he reviewed Conway's book On Numbers and Games and even managed to explain Conway's surreal numbers.[19]/nConway was a prominent member of Martin Gardner's Mathematical Grapevine. He regularly visited Gardner and often wrote him long letters summarizing his recreational research. In a 1976 visit, Gardner kept him for a week, pumping him for information on the Penrose tilings which had just been announced. Conway had discovered many (if not most) of the major properties of the tilings.[20] Gardner used these results when he introduced the world to Penrose tiles in his January 1977 column.[21] The cover of that issue of Scientific American features the Penrose tiles and is based on a sketch by Conway.[17]/nConway was married three times.

His initial experiments in that field were done with pen and paper, long before personal computers existed. Since Conway's game was popularized by Martin Gardner in Scientific American in 1970,[28] it has spawned hundreds of computer programs, web sites, and articles.[29] It is a staple of recreational mathematics. There is an extensive wiki devoted to curating and cataloging the various aspects of the game.[30] From the earliest days, it has been a favorite in computer labs, both for its theoretical interest and as a practical exercise in programming and data display. Conway came to dislike how discussions of him heavily focused on his Game of Life, feeling that it overshadowed deeper and more important things he had done, although he remained proud of his work on it.[31] The game helped to launch a new branch of mathematics, the field of cellular automata.[32]\nThe Game of Life is known to be Turing complete.[33][34]/nConway contributed to combinatorial game theory (CGT), a theory of partisan games. He developed the theory with Elwyn Berlekamp and Richard Guy, and also co-authored the book Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays with them. He also wrote On Numbers and Games (ONAG) which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT./nHe was also one of the inventors of the game sprouts, as well as philosopher's football. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the Soma cube, peg solitaire, and Conway's soldiers. He came up with the angel problem, which was solved in 2006./nHe invented a new system of numbers, the surreal numbers, which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by Donald Knuth.[35] He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly large numbers, the Conway chained arrow notation. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ONAG./nIn the mid-1960s with Michael Guy, Conway established that there are sixty-four convex uniform polychora excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the grand antiprism in the process, the only non-Wythoffian uniform polychoron.[36] Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing polyhedra called Conway polyhedron notation./nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the Conway criterion which is a fast way to identify many prototiles that tile the plane.[37]/nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the Leech lattice./nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the Alexander polynomial and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.[38] After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel knot polynomials.[39] Conway further developed tangle theory and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, now known as Conway notation, while correcting a number of errors in the 19th-century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.[40] The Conway knot is named after him./nConway's conjecture that, in any thrackle, the number of edges is at most equal to the number of vertices, is still open./nHe was the primary author of the ATLAS of Finite Groups giving properties of many finite simple groups. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and Simon P. Norton he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the sporadic groups. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the Leech lattice, which have been designated the Conway groups.[41] This work made him a key player in the successful classification of the finite simple groups./nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician John McKay, Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as monstrous moonshine. This subject, named by Conway, relates the monster group with elliptic modular functions, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014finite groups and complex function theory. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to string theory.[42]/nConway introduced the Mathieu groupoid, an extension of the Mathieu group M12 to 13 points./nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a conjecture by Edward Waring, that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though Chen Jingrun solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.[43] In 1972, Conway proved that a natural generalization of the Collatz problem is algorithmically undecidable. Related to that, he developed the esoteric programming language FRACTRAN. While lecturing on Collatz conjecture, Terence Tao (who was taught by him in graduate school) mentioned Conway's result and said that he was \"always very good at making extremely weird connections in mathematics\".[44]/nConway wrote a textbook on Stephen Kleene's theory of state machines and published original work on algebraic structures, focusing particularly on quaternions and octonions.[45]  Together with Neil Sloane, he invented the icosians.[46]/nHe invented a base 13 function as a counterexample to the converse of the intermediate value theorem: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a Darboux property but is not continuous./nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the Doomsday algorithm. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on finite-state machines./nIn 2004, Conway and Simon B. Kochen, another Princeton mathematician, proved the free will theorem, a version of the \"no hidden variables\" principle of quantum mechanics. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. Conway said that \"if experimenters have free will, then so do elementary particles.\"[47]/nConway received the Berwick Prize (1971),[48] was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (1981),[49][50] became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992, was the first recipient of the P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS) (1987),[48] won the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (1998) and received the Leroy P.

She made a number of contributions to the field and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Groningen.[2] She grasped four-dimensional geometry from an early age, and introduced the term \"polytope\" for a convex solid in four or more dimensions.[3]/nAlicia Boole was born in Cork, Ireland, the third of five daughters of English parents: mathematician and logician George Boole and Mary Everest Boole, a self-taught mathematician and educationalist. Of her sisters, Lucy Everest Boole was a chemist and pharmacist and Ethel Lilian Voynich was a novelist./nAfter her father's sudden death in 1864, the family moved to London, where her mother became the librarian at Queen's College, London.[4] Alicia attended the school attached to Queens' College with one of her sisters, but never attended university. She was known to her friends and family as Alice, though she always published under the name Alicia./nAlicia was the only Boole sister to inherit the mathematical career of her parents, although her mother Mary Everest Boole had brought up all of her five children from an early age 'to acquaint them with the flow of geometry' by projecting shapes onto paper, hanging pendulums etc.[5] She was first exposed to geometric models by her brother-in-law Charles Howard Hinton when she was 17, and developed the ability to visualise in a fourth dimension.[2][4] She found that there are exactly six regular polytopes in four dimensions. They are bounded by 5, 16 or 600 tetrahedra, 8 cubes, 24 octahedra or 120 dodecahedra. That discovery had been made by Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli before 1850 but his work was as yet unpublished, and in any case Alicia had no opportunity to study mathematics. She introduced the term polytope because she did not know Schl\u00e4fli's term polyscheme.[6] She produced three-dimensional central cross-sections of all the six regular polytopes by purely Euclidean constructions and synthetic methods for the simple reason that she had never learned any analytic geometry. She made cardboard models of all these sections./nAfter taking up secretarial work near Liverpool in 1889 she met and married Walter Stott, an actuary, in 1890. They had two children together, Mary (1891\u20131982) and Leonard (1892\u20131963).[7] Stott learned of Pieter Schoute's work on central sections of the regular polytopes in 1895. Schoute came to England and worked with Alicia Stott, persuading her to publish her results which she did in two papers published in Amsterdam in 1900 and 1910.[8]/nThe University of Groningen honoured her by inviting her to attend the tercentenary celebrations of the university and awarding her an honorary doctorate in 1914.[9] After Schoute's death in 1913 Alicia took a hiatus from mathematical work./nIn 1930 she was introduced by her nephew Geoffrey Ingram Taylor to Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter and they worked together on various problems.[9] Alicia made two further important discoveries relating to constructions for polyhedra related to the golden section. She presented a joint paper with Coxeter at the University of Cambridge.[4] Coxeter later wrote, \"The strength and simplicity of her character combined with the diversity of her interests to make her an inspiring friend.\"[3]/nAlicia died in Middlesex in 1940.[9] In spring 2001, a paper roll of coloured drawings of polyhedra was found at Groningen University.[4] Though unsigned, it was immediately recognised as Alicia's work.

He had perhaps the widest coverage of any mathematician of his time,[9]  integrating pure and applied sciences and making major contributions to many fields, including mathematics, physics, economics, computing, and statistics. He was a pioneer in building the mathematical framework of quantum physics, in the development of functional analysis, and in game theory, introducing or codifying concepts including cellular automata, the universal constructor and the digital computer. His analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA./nDuring World War II, von Neumann worked on the Manhattan Project on nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb. He developed the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon.[10] Before and after the war, he consulted for many organizations including the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.[11] At the peak of his influence in the 1950s, he chaired a number of Defense Department committees including the Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee and the ICBM Scientific Advisory Committee. He was also a member of the influential Atomic Energy Commission in charge of all atomic energy development in the country.

John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann);[19] her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels of the Meisels family.[20] Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.[21]/nOn February 20, 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph elevated John's father to the Hungarian nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[22] The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai, meaning \"of Margitta\" (today Marghita, Romania). The family had no connection with the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was their chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites. Neumann J\u00e1nos became margittai Neumann J\u00e1nos (John Neumann de Margitta), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.[23]/nVon Neumann was a child prodigy who at six years old could divide two eight-digit numbers in his head[24][25] and could converse in Ancient Greek. When the six-year-old von Neumann caught his mother staring aimlessly, he asked her, \"What are you calculating?\"[26]/nWhen they were young, von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins were instructed by governesses. Von Neumann's father believed that knowledge of languages other than their native Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian.[27] By the age of eight, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, and by twelve he had read and understood Borel's La Th\u00e9orie des Fonctions.[28] He was also interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume world history series Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen (General History in Monographs).[29] One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.[30]/nVon Neumann entered the Lutheran Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium in 1914.[31] Eugene Wigner was a year ahead of von Neumann at the Lutheran School and soon became his friend.[32]/nAlthough von Neumann's father insisted that he attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give von Neumann advanced instruction. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151.[32] By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition.[33] At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, he applied for and won the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Prize, a national award for mathematics.[34]/nAccording to his friend Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, von Neumann's father wanted John to follow him into industry, and asked von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n to persuade his son not to take mathematics as his major.[35] Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was chemical engineering. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year, non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to  ETH Zurich,[36] which he passed in September 1923.[37] Simultaneously von Neumann also entered P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter University in Budapest,[38] as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he produced an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory.[39][40] He graduated as a chemical engineer from ETH Zurich in 1926, and passed his final examinations summa cum laude for his Ph.D. in mathematics (with minors in experimental physics and chemistry) simultaneous with his chemical engineering degree.[41][42]  He then went to the University of G\u00f6ttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.[43] Hermann Weyl, in his obituary of Emmy Noether, remembers how in the winter of 1926\u20131927 von Neumann, Noether, and he would take walks after his classes through \"the cold, wet, rain-wet streets of G\u00f6ttingen\" discussing hypercomplex number systems and their representations.[44]/nVon Neumann's habilitation was completed on December 13, 1927, and he began to give lectures as a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928.[45] He was the youngest person ever elected Privatdozent in the university's history in any subject.[46] He began writing nearly one major mathematics paper per month.[47] In 1929, he briefly became a Privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better,[48] then in October of that year moved to Princeton University as a visiting lecturer in mathematical physics.[49]/nVon Neumann was baptized a Catholic in 1930.[50] Shortly afterward, von Neumann married Marietta K\u00f6vesi, who had studied economics at Budapest University.[49] Von Neumann and Marietta had a daughter, Marina, born in 1935. As of 2021 Marina is a distinguished professor emerita of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan.[51] The couple divorced on November 2, 1937.[52] On November 17, 1938, von Neumann married Klara Dan.[53][54]/nIn 1933 Von Neumann accepted a tenured professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study in New Jersey, when that institution's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl appeared to have failed.[55] His mother, brothers and in-law followed von Neumann to the United States in 1939.[56] Von Neumann anglicized his first name to John, keeping the German-aristocratic surname von Neumann. His brothers changed theirs to \"Neumann\" and \"Vonneumann\".[23] Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937, and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the United States Army's Officers Reserve Corps. He passed the exams but was rejected because of his age.[57]/nHe was also known for always being happy to provide others with scientific and mathematical advice,[4] even when the recipient did not later credit him, which he did on many occasions with mathematicians and scientists of all ability levels.[58][59] Wigner wrote that he perhaps supervised more work (in a casual sense) than any other modern mathematician. Collected works of colleagues at Princeton are full of references to hints or results from casual conversations with him.[60]/nKlara and John von Neumann were socially active within the local academic community.[61] His white clapboard house at 26 Westcott Road was one of Princeton's largest private residences.[62] He always wore formal suits, including a three-piece pinstripe while riding down the Grand Canyon astride a mule.[63] Von Neumann held a lifelong passion for ancient history and was renowned for his historical knowledge.[64] He enjoyed Yiddish and \"off-color\" humor (especially limericks).[28] He was a non-smoker.[65] In Princeton, he received complaints for playing extremely loud German march music on his phonograph.[66] Von Neumann did some of his best work in noisy, chaotic environments, including with his wife's phonograph playing loudly.[67] Per Churchill Eisenhart, von Neumann could attend parties until the early hours of the morning and then deliver a lucid lecture at 8:30.[68]/nHis daughter wrote in her memoirs that he was very concerned with his legacy in two aspects: her life and the durability of his intellectual contributions to the world.[69]/nMany considered him an excellent chairman of committees, deferring rather easily on personal or organizational matters but pressing on technical ones. Herbert York described the many \"Von Neumann Committees\" that he participated in as \"remarkable in style as well as output\". The way the committees von Neumann chaired worked directly and intimately with the necessary military or corporate entities became a blueprint for all Air Force long-range missile programs.[70] Many people who had known von Neumann were puzzled by his relationship to the military and to power structures in general.[71] He seemed to admire generals and admirals and more generally those who wielded power in society. Stanis\u0142aw Ulam suspected that he had a hidden admiration for people or organizations that could influence the thoughts and decision making of others.[72]/nHe also maintained his knowledge of languages learnt in his youth. He knew Hungarian, French, German and English fluently, and maintained at least a conversational level of Italian, Yiddish, Latin and Ancient Greek. His Spanish was less perfect, but once on a trip to Mexico he tried to create his own \"neo-Castilian\" mix of English and Spanish.[73] He had an encyclopedic knowledge of ancient history,[74] and he enjoyed reading Ancient Greek historians such as Thucydides and Herodotus in the original Greek. Ulam suspected they may have shaped his views on how future events could play out and how human nature and society worked in general.[75]/nVon Neumann's closest friend in the United States was the mathematician Ulam.[76] Von Neumann believed that much of his mathematical thought occurred intuitively; he would often go to sleep with a problem unsolved and know the answer upon waking up.[67] Ulam noted that von Neumann's way of thinking might not be visual, but more aural.[77] Ulam recalled, \"Quite independently of his liking for abstract wit, he had a strong appreciation (one might say almost a hunger) for the more earthy type of comedy and humor\".[78]/nIn 1955, a mass was found near von Neumann's collarbone; the mass turned out to be cancer originating in the skeleton, pancreas or prostate. (While there is general agreement that the tumour had metastasised from elsewhere, sources differ on the location of the primary cancer.)[79][80] The malignancy may have been caused by exposure to radiation at Los Alamos National Laboratory.[81] Unable to accept his impending death,[82] Von Neumann was given last rites by Father Strittmatter before dying.[83][84] Father Strittmatter recalled that even after administering the last rites, von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it, as he still remained terrified of death.[85] Of his religious views, Von Neumann reportedly said, \"So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end,\" referring to Pascal's wager. He confided to his mother, \"There probably has to be a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't.\"[86][87]/nHe died on February 8, 1957, at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital and was buried at Princeton Cemetery of Nassau Presbyterian Church in Princeton, New Jersey.[88][89]/nThe axiomatization of mathematics, on the model of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth at the end of the 19th century, particularly in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms.[90] But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves).[91] The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets\u2014the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.[90]/nThe axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another, then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration called the method of inner models, which became an essential instrument in set theory.[90]/nThe second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class that belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class that does not belong to other classes. On the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets that do not belong to themselves. In contrast, on von Neumann's approach, the class of all sets that do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class, not a set.[90]/nOverall, von Neumann's major achievement in set theory was an \"axiomatization of set theory and (connected with that) elegant theory of the ordinal and cardinal numbers as well as the first strict formulation of principles of definitions by the transfinite induction\".[92]/nBuilding on the Hausdorff paradox of Felix Hausdorff (1914), Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski in 1924 showed how to subdivide a three-dimensional ball into disjoint sets, then translate and rotate these sets to form two identical copies of the same ball; this is the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox. They also proved that a two-dimensional disk has no such paradoxical decomposition. But in 1929,[93] von Neumann subdivided the disk into finitely many pieces and rearranged them into two disks, using area-preserving affine transformations instead of translations and rotations. The result depended on finding free groups of affine transformations, an important technique extended later by von Neumann in his work on measure theory.[94]/nWith the contributions of von Neumann to sets, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems.[95]/nBy 1927, von Neumann was involving himself in discussions with others in G\u00f6ttingen on whether elementary arithmetic followed from Peano axioms.[96] Building on the work of Ackermann, von Neumann began attempting to prove (using the finistic methods of Hilbert's school) the consistency of first-order arithmetic. He succeeded in proving the consistency of a fragment of arithmetic of natural numbers (through the use of restrictions on induction).[97] He continued looking for a more general proof of the consistency of classical mathematics using methods from proof theory.[98]/nA strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences of K\u00f6nigsberg, in which Kurt G\u00f6del announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems necessarily remains incomplete.[99] At the conference, Von Neumann suggested to G\u00f6del that he should try to transform his results for undecidable propositions about integers.[100]/nLess than a month later, von Neumann communicated to G\u00f6del an interesting consequence of his theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency.[99] G\u00f6del replied, saying he had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem, and that he would send a preprint of his article containing both results, which never appeared.[101][102][103] Von Neumann acknowledged G\u00f6del's priority in his next letter.[104] However, von Neumann's method of proof differed from G\u00f6del's, and he was also of the opinion that the second incompleteness theorem had dealt a much stronger blow to Hilbert's program than G\u00f6del thought it did.[105][106] With this discovery, which drastically changed his views on mathematical rigor, von Neumann ceased research in the foundations of mathematics and metamathematics and instead spent time on problems connected with applications.[107]/nIn a series of papers published in 1932, von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure.[108] Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos wrote that even \"if von Neumann had never done anything else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality\".[109] By then von Neumann had already written his articles on operator theory, and the application of this work was instrumental in his mean ergodic theorem.[110]/nThe theorem is about arbitrary one-parameter unitary groups \n\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\nV\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathit {t}}\\to {\\mathit {V_{t}}}}\n\n and states that for every vector \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi }\n\n in the Hilbert space, \n\n\n\n\nlim\n\nT\n\u2192\n\u221e\n\n\n\n\n1\nT\n\n\n\n\u222b\n\n0\n\n\nT\n\n\n\nV\n\nt\n\n\n(\n\u03d5\n)\n\nd\nt\n\n\n{\\textstyle \\lim _{T\\to \\infty }{\\frac {1}{T}}\\int _{0}^{T}V_{t}(\\phi )\\,dt}\n\n exists in the sense of the metric defined by the Hilbert norm and is a vector \n\n\n\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\psi }\n\n which is such that \n\n\n\n\nV\n\nt\n\n\n(\n\u03c8\n)\n=\n\u03c8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V_{t}(\\psi )=\\psi }\n\n for all \n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n. This was proven in the first paper. In the second paper, von Neumann argued that his results here were sufficient for physical applications relating to Boltzmann's ergodic hypothesis. He also pointed out that ergodicity had not yet been achieved and isolated this for future work.[111]/nLater in the year he published another long and influential paper that began the systematic study of ergodicity. In this paper he gave and proved a decomposition theorem showing that the ergodic measure preserving actions of the real line are the fundamental building blocks from which all measure preserving actions can be built. Several other key theorems are given and proven. The results in this paper and another in conjunction with Paul Halmos have significant applications in other areas of mathematics.[111][112]/nIn measure theory, the \"problem of measure\" for an n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn may be stated as: \"does there exist a positive, normalized, invariant, and additive set function on the class of all subsets of Rn?\"[113] The work of Felix Hausdorff and Stefan Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if n = 1 or n = 2 and a negative solution (because of the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox) in all other cases. Von Neumann's work argued that the \"problem is essentially group-theoretic in character\" - the existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the properties of the transformation group of the given space. The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the negative solution for higher dimensions, comes from the fact that the Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two, and is not solvable for higher dimensions. \"Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the change of group that makes a difference, not the change of space.\"[114] Around 1942 he told Dorothy Maharam how to prove that every complete \u03c3-finite measure space has a multiplicative lifting, however he did not publish this proof and she later came up with a new one.[115]/nIn a number of von Neumann's papers, the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions.[116] A major contribution von Neumann made to measure theory was the result of a paper written to answer a question of Haar regarding whether there existed an algebra of all bounded functions on the real number line such that they form \"a complete system of representatives of the classes of almost everywhere-equal measurable bounded functions\".[117] He proved this in the positive, and in later papers with Stone discussed various generalizations and algebraic aspects of this problem.[118] He also proved by new methods the existence of disintegrations for various general types of measures. Von Neumann also gave a new proof on the uniqueness of Haar measures by using the mean values of functions, although this method only worked for compact groups.[117] He had to create entirely new techniques to apply this to locally compact groups.[119] He also gave a new, ingenious proof for the Radon\u2013Nikodym theorem.[120] His lecture notes on measure theory at the Institute for Advanced Study were an important source for knowledge on the topic in America at the time, and were later published.[121][122][123]/nUsing his previous work on measure theory, von Neumann made several contributions to the theory of topological groups, beginning with a paper on almost periodic functions on groups, where von Neumann extended Bohr's theory of almost periodic functions to arbitrary groups.[124] He continued this work with another paper in conjunction with Bochner that improved the theory of almost periodicity to include functions that took on elements of linear spaces as values rather than numbers.[125] In 1938, he was awarded the B\u00f4cher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis in relation to these papers.[126][127]/nIn a 1933 paper, he used the newly discovered Haar measure in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem for the case of compact groups.[128] The basic idea behind this was discovered several years earlier when von Neumann published a paper on the analytic properties of groups of linear transformations and found that closed subgroups of a general linear group are Lie groups.[129] This was later extended by Cartan to arbitrary Lie groups in the form of the closed-subgroup theorem.[130][117]/nVon Neumann was the first person to axiomatically define an abstract Hilbert space. He defined it as a complex vector space with a Hermitian scalar product, with the corresponding norm being both separable and complete. In the same papers he also proved the general form of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality that had previously been known only in specific examples.[131] He continued with the development of the spectral theory of operators in Hilbert space in 3 seminal papers between 1929 and 1932.[132] This work cumulated in his Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics which among two other books by Stone and Banach in the same year were the first monographs on Hilbert space theory.[133] Previous work by others showed that a theory of weak topologies could not be obtained by using sequences, and von Neumann was the first to outline a program of how to overcome the difficulties, which resulted in him defining locally convex spaces and topological vector spaces for the first time. In addition several other topological properties he defined at the time (he was among the first mathematicians to apply new topological ideas from Hausdorff from Euclidean to Hilbert spaces)[134] such as boundness and total boundness are still used today.[135] For twenty years von Neumann was considered the 'undisputed master' of this area.[117] These developments were primarily prompted by needs in quantum mechanics where von Neumann realized the need to extend the spectral theory of Hermitian operators from the bounded to the unbounded case.[136] Other major achievements in these papers include a complete elucidation of spectral theory for normal operators, the first abstract presentation of the trace of a positive operator,[137][138] a generalisation of Riesz's presentation of Hilbert's spectral theorems at the time, and the discovery of Hermitian operators in a Hilbert space, as distinct from self-adjoint operators, which enabled him to give a description of all Hermitian operators which extend a given Hermitian operator. In addition he wrote a paper detailing how the usage of infinite matrices, common at the time in spectral theory, was inadequate as a representation for Hermitian operators. His work on operator theory lead to his most profound invention in pure mathematics, the study of von Neumann algebras and in general of operator algebras.[139]/nHis later work on rings of operators lead to him revisiting his earlier work on spectral theory and providing a new way of working through the geometric content of the spectral theory by the use of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces.[136] Like in his work on measure theory he proved several theorems that he did not find time to publish. Nachman Aronszajn and K. T. Smith were told by him that in the early 1930s he proved the existence of proper invariant subspaces for completely continuous operators in a Hilbert space while working on the invariant subspace problem.[140]/nWith I. J. Schoenberg he wrote several items investigating translation invariant Hilbertian metrics on the real number line which resulted in their complete classification. Their motivation lie in various questions related to embedding metric spaces into Hilbert spaces.[141][142]/nWith Pascual Jordan he wrote a short paper giving the first derivation of a given norm from an inner product by means of the parallelogram identity.[143] His trace inequality is a key result of matrix theory used in matrix approximation problems.[144] He also first presented the idea that the dual of a pre-norm is a norm in the first major paper discussing the theory of unitarily invariant norms and symmetric gauge functions (now known as  symmetric absolute norms).[145][146][147] This paper leads naturally to the study of symmetric operator ideals and is the beginning point for modern studies of symmetric operator spaces.[148]/nLater with Robert Schatten he initiated the study of nuclear operators on Hilbert spaces,[149][150] tensor products of Banach spaces,[151] introduced and studied trace class operators,[152] their ideals, and their duality with compact operators, and preduality with bounded operators.[153] The generalization of this topic to the study of nuclear operators on Banach spaces was among the first achievements of Alexander Grothendieck.[154][155] Previously in 1937 von Neumann published several results in this area, for example giving 1-parameter scale of different cross norms on \n\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nn\n\n\n\u2297\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\textit {l}}\\,_{2}^{n}\\otimes {\\textit {l}}\\,_{2}^{n}}\n\n and proving several other results on what are now known as Schatten\u2013von Neumann ideals.[156]/nVon Neumann founded the study of rings of operators, through the von Neumann algebras (originally called W*-algebras). While his original ideas for rings of operators existed already in 1930, he did not begin studying them in depth until he met F. J. Murray several years later.[157][158] A von Neumann algebra is a *-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator.[159] The von Neumann bicommutant theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as being equal to the bicommutant.[160] After elucidating the study of the commutative algebra case, von Neumann embarked in 1936, with the partial collaboration of Murray, on the noncommutative case, the general study of factors classification of von Neumann algebras. The six major papers in which he developed that theory between 1936 and 1940 \"rank among the masterpieces of analysis in the twentieth century\".[161] The nearly 500 pages that the papers span collect many foundational results and started several programs in operator algebra theory that mathematicians worked on for decades afterwards. An example is the classification of factors.[162] In addition in 1938 he proved that every von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is a direct integral of factors yet he did not find time to publish this result until 1949.[163][164] Von Neumann algebras relate closely to a theory of noncommutative integration, something that von Neumann hinted to in his work but did not explicitly write out.[165][166] Another important result on polar decomposition was published in 1932.[167]/nBetween 1935 and 1937, von Neumann worked on lattice theory, the theory of partially ordered sets in which every two elements have a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. As Garrett Birkhoff wrote, \"John von Neumann's brilliant mind blazed over lattice theory like a meteor\".[168] Von Neumann combined traditional projective geometry with modern algebra (linear algebra, ring theory, lattice theory). Many previously geometric results could then be interpreted in the case of general modules over rings. His work laid the foundations for modern work in projective geometry.[169]/nHis biggest contribution was founding the field of continuous geometry.[170] It followed his path-breaking work on rings of operators. In mathematics, continuous geometry is a substitute of complex projective geometry, where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set \n\n\n\n0\n,\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 0,1,...,{\\mathit {n}}}\n\n it can be an element of the unit interval \n\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [0,1]}\n\n. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry in terms of the properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.\nWhile the dimensions of the subspaces of projective geometries are a discrete set (the non-negative integers), the dimensions of the elements of a continuous geometry can range continuously across the unit interval \n\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [0,1]}\n\n. Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the hyperfinite type II factor.[171][172]/nIn more pure lattice theoretical work, he solved the difficult problem of characterizing the class of \n\n\n\n\n\nC\nG\n(\nF\n)\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathit {CG(F)}}}\n\n (continuous-dimensional projective geometry over an arbitrary division ring \n\n\n\n\n\nF\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathit {F}}\\,}\n\n) in abstract language of lattice theory.[173] Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed complemented modular topological lattices (properties that arise in the lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces): \"Dimension is determined, up to a positive linear transformation, by the following two properties. It is conserved by perspective mappings (\"perspectivities\") and ordered by inclusion. The deepest part of the proof concerns the equivalence of perspectivity with \"projectivity by decomposition\"\u2014of which a corollary is the transitivity of perspectivity.\"/nFor any integer \n\n\n\nn\n>\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n>3}\n\n every \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathit {n}}}\n\n-dimensional abstract projective geometry is isomorphic to the subspace-lattice of an \n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\mathit {n}}}\n\n-dimensional vector space \n\n\n\n\nV\n\nn\n\n\n(\nF\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V_{n}(F)}\n\n over a (unique) corresponding  division ring \n\n\n\nF\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F}\n\n. This is known as the Veblen\u2013Young theorem. Von Neumann extended this fundamental result in projective geometry to the continuous dimensional case.[174] This coordinatization theorem is a deep and important result that stimulated considerable work in abstract projective geometry and lattice theory, much of which continued using von Neumann's techniques.[169][175] Birkhoff described this theorem as follows:\"Any complemented modular lattice L having a \"basis\" of n \u2265 4 pairwise perspective elements, is isomorphic with the lattice \u211b(R) of all principal right-ideals of a suitable regular ring R. This conclusion is the culmination of 140 pages of brilliant and incisive algebra involving entirely novel axioms. Anyone wishing to get an unforgettable impression of the razor edge of von Neumann's mind, need merely try to pursue this chain of exact reasoning for himself\u2014realizing that often five pages of it were written down before breakfast, seated at a living room writing-table in a bathrobe.\"[176]/nThis work required the creation of regular rings.[177] A von Neumann regular ring is a ring where for every \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n, an element \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n exists such that \n\n\n\na\nx\na\n=\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle axa=a}\n\n.[176] These rings came from and have connections to his work on von Neumann algebras, as well as AW*-algebras and various kinds of C*-algebras.[178]/nMany smaller technical results were proven during the creation and proof of the above theorems, particularly regarding distributivity (such as infinite distributivity), von Neumann developing them as needed. He also developed a theory of valuations in lattices, and shared in developing the general theory of metric lattices.[179]/nBirkhoff noted in his posthumous article on von Neumann that most of these results were developed in an intense two year period of work, and that while his interests continued in lattice theory after 1937, they became peripheral and mainly occurred in letters to other mathematicians. A final contribution in 1940 was for a joint seminar he conducted with Birkhoff at the Institute for Advanced Study on the subject where he developed a theory of \u03c3-complete lattice ordered rings. He never wrote up the work for publication and afterwards became busy with war work and his interests moved to computers. He finished his article by saying, \"One wonders what would have been the effect on lattice theory, if von Neumann's intense two-year preoccupation with lattice theory had continued for twenty years!\"[180]/nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions to mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables.[181] This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin\u2013Watson statistic[182] for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.[182]/nSubsequently, Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava extended the results for testing whether the errors on a regression model follow a Gaussian random walk (i.e., possess a unit root) against the alternative that they are a stationary first order autoregression.[183]/nIn his early years, von Neumann published several papers related to set-theoretical real analysis and number theory.[184] In a paper from 1925, he proved that for any dense sequence of points in \n\n\n\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle [0,1]}\n\n, there existed a rearrangement of those points that is uniformly distributed.[185][186][187] In 1926 his sole publication was on Pr\u00fcfer's theory of ideal algebraic numbers where he found a new way of constructing them, thus extending Pr\u00fcfer's theory to the field of all algebraic numbers, and clarified their relation to p-adic numbers.[188][189][190][191][192] In 1928 he published two additional papers continuing with these themes. The first dealt with partitioning an interval into countably many congruent subsets. It solved a problem of Hugo Steinhaus asking whether an interval is \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}}\n\n-divisible. Von Neumann proved that indeed that all intervals, half-open, open, or closed are \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}}\n\n-divisible by translations (i.e. that these intervals can be decomposed into \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}}\n\n subsets that are congruent by translation).[193][194][195][196] His next paper dealt with giving a constructive proof without the axiom of choice that \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2^{\\aleph _{0}}}\n\n algebraically independent reals exist. He proved that \n\n\n\n\nA\n\nr\n\n\n=\n\n\n\u2211\n\nn\n=\n0\n\n\n\u221e\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n[\nn\nr\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\nn\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A_{r}=\\textstyle \\sum _{n=0}^{\\infty }2^{2^{[nr]}}\\!{\\big /}\\,2^{2^{n^{2}}}}\n\n are algebraically independent for \n\n\n\nr\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r>0}\n\n. Consequently, there exists a perfect algebraically independent set of reals the size of the continuum.[197][198][199][200] Other minor results from his early career include a proof of a maximum principle for the gradient of a minimizing function in the field of calculus of variations,[201][202][203][204] and a small simplification of Hermann Minkowski's theorem for linear forms in geometric number theory.[205][206][207]/nLater in his career together with Pascual Jordan and Eugene Wigner he wrote a foundational paper classifying all finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebras and discovering the Albert algebras while attempting to look for a better mathematical formalism for quantum theory.[208][209] A couple years later in 1936 he wrote another paper by himself in an attempt to further the program of replacing the axioms of his previous Hilbert space program with those of Jordan algebras.[210] In this paper he investigated the infinite-dimensional case and planned to write at least one further paper on the topic however this paper never came to fruition.[211] Nevertheless these axioms formed the basis for further investigations of algebraic quantum mechanics started by Irving Segal.[212][213]/nVon Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac\u2013von Neumann axioms, in his widely influential 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.[214] After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized in 1926 that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.[215]/nThe physics of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the uncertainty principle, according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the non-commutativity of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schr\u00f6dinger.[215] When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a self-adjoint operator and one that was merely symmetric, Heisenberg replied \"Eh? What is the difference?\"[216]/nVon Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined \"hidden variables\", as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1935, Grete Hermann published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid.[217] Hermann's work was largely ignored until after John S. Bell made essentially the same argument in 1966.[218] In 2010, Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all hidden variable theories, does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation and did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.[219] The validity of Bub's argument is, in turn, disputed. Gleason's theorem of 1957 provided an argument against hidden variables along the lines of von Neumann's, but founded on assumptions seen as better motivated and more physically meaningful.[220][221]/nVon Neumann's proof inaugurated a line of research that ultimately led, through Bell's theorem and the experiments of Alain Aspect in 1982, to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a notion of reality substantially different from that of classical physics, or must include nonlocality in apparent violation of special relativity.[222]/nIn a chapter of The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, von Neumann deeply analyzed the so-called measurement problem. He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the universal wave function. Since something \"outside the calculation\" was needed to collapse the wave function, von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter. He argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the \"subjective consciousness\" of the human observer. In other words, while the line between observer and observed could be drawn in different places, the theory only makes sense if an observer exists somewhere.[223] Although the idea of consciousness causing collapse was accepted by Eugene Wigner,[224] the Von Neumann\u2013Wigner interpretation never gained acceptance among the majority of physicists.[225]/nThough theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formalism of problems in quantum mechanics underlying most approaches that can be traced back to the mathematical formalisms and techniques first used by von Neumann. In other words, discussions about interpretation of the theory, and extensions to it, are now mostly conducted on the basis of shared assumptions about the mathematical foundations.[214]/nViewing von Neumann's work on quantum mechanics as a part of the fulfilment of Hilbert's sixth problem, noted mathematical physicist A. S. Wightman said in 1974 his axiomization of quantum theory was perhaps the most important axiomization of a physical theory to date. In the publication of his 1932 book, quantum mechanics became a mature theory in the sense it had a precise mathematical form, which allowed for clear answers to conceptual problems.[226] Nevertheless, von Neumann in his later years felt he had failed in this aspect of his scientific work as despite all the mathematics he developed (operator theory, von Neumann algebras, continuous geometries, etc.), he did not find a satisfactory mathematical framework for quantum theory as a whole (including quantum field theory).[227][228]/nVon Neumann entropy is extensively used in different forms (conditional entropy, relative entropy, etc.) in the framework of quantum information theory.[229] Entanglement measures are based upon some quantity directly related to the von Neumann entropy. Given a statistical ensemble of quantum mechanical systems with the density matrix \n\n\n\n\u03c1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\rho }\n\n, it is given by \n\n\n\nS\n(\n\u03c1\n)\n=\n\u2212\nTr\n\u2061\n(\n\u03c1\nln\n\u2061\n\u03c1\n)\n.\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle S(\\rho )=-\\operatorname {Tr} (\\rho \\ln \\rho ).\\,}\n\n Many of the same entropy measures in classical information theory can also be generalized to the quantum case, such as Holevo entropy[230] and conditional quantum entropy. Quantum information theory is largely concerned with the interpretation and uses of von Neumann entropy, a cornerstone in the former's development; the Shannon entropy applies to classical information theory.[231]/nThe formalism of density operators and matrices was introduced by von Neumann[232] in 1927 and independently, but less systematically by Lev Landau[233] and Felix Bloch[234] in 1927 and 1946 respectively. The density matrix is an alternative way to represent the state of a quantum system including statistical probabilities, which are not easily represented using wavefunctions.[citation needed]/nThe von Neumann measurement scheme, the ancestor of quantum decoherence theory, represents measurements projectively by taking into account the measuring apparatus which is also treated as a quantum object. The 'projective measurement' scheme introduced by von Neumann led to the development of quantum decoherence theories.[235][236]/nVon Neumann first proposed a quantum logic in his 1932 treatise Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, where he noted that projections on a Hilbert space can be viewed as propositions about physical observables. The field of quantum logic was subsequently inaugurated, in a famous paper of 1936 by von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to introduce quantum logics,[237] wherein von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., horizontally and vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added between the other two, the photons will indeed pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the non-commutativity of conjunction \n\n\n\n(\nA\n\u2227\nB\n)\n\u2260\n(\nB\n\u2227\nA\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (A\\land B)\\neq (B\\land A)}\n\n. It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, \n\n\n\nP\n\u2228\n(\nQ\n\u2227\nR\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P\\lor (Q\\land R)={}}\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nP\n\u2228\nQ\n)\n\u2227\n(\nP\n\u2228\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (P\\lor Q)\\land (P\\lor R)}\n\n and \n\n\n\nP\n\u2227\n(\nQ\n\u2228\nR\n)\n=\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle P\\land (Q\\lor R)={}}\n\n\n\n\n\n(\nP\n\u2227\nQ\n)\n\u2228\n(\nP\n\u2227\nR\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (P\\land Q)\\lor (P\\land R)}\n\n, are not valid for quantum theory.[238]/nThe reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is in turn attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case in quantum mechanics that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members is necessarily indeterminate. Consequently, the distributive law of classical logic must be replaced with a weaker condition.[238] Instead of a distributive lattice, propositions about a quantum system form an orthomodular lattice isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space associated with that system.[239]/nNevertheless, he was never satisfied with his work on quantum logic. He intended it to be a joint synthesis of formal logic and probability theory and when he attempted to write up a paper for the Henry Joseph Lecture he gave at the Washington Philosophical Society in 1945 he found that he could not, especially given that he was busy with war work at the time. He just could not make himself write something he did not fully understand to his satisfaction. During his address at the 1954 International Congress of Mathematicians he gave this issue as one of the unsolved problems that future mathematicians could work on.[240][241] However, the problems mentioned were well established in the scientific community by then, prompting one audience member to say in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the hall, \"Aufgew\u00e4rmte Suppe\", which is German for \"warmed-up soup\".[242]/nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions in the field of fluid dynamics, including the classic flow solution to blast waves,[243] and the co-discovery (independently by Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Werner D\u00f6ring) of the ZND detonation model of explosives.[244] During the 1930s, von Neumann became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.[245]/nLater with Robert D. Richtmyer, von Neumann developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.[246]/nVon Neumann soon applied computer modelling to the field, developing software for his ballistics research. During World War II, he arrived one day at the office of R. H. Kent, the director of the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, with a computer program for calculating a one-dimensional model of 100 molecules to simulate a shock wave. Von Neumann gave a seminar on his computer program to an audience which included his friend Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n. After von Neumann had finished, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said \"Well, Johnny, that's very interesting. Of course you realize Lagrange also used digital models to simulate continuum mechanics.\" It was evident from von Neumann's face, that he had been unaware of Lagrange's M\u00e9canique analytique.[247]/nWhile not as prolific in physics as he was in mathematics, he nevertheless made several other notable contributions to it. His pioneering papers with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar on the statistics of a fluctuating gravitational field generated by randomly distributed stars were considered a tour de force.[248] In this paper they developed a theory of two-body relaxation[249] and used the Holtsmark distribution to model[250] the dynamics of stellar systems.[251] He wrote several other unpublished manuscripts on topics in stellar structure, some of which were included in Chandrasekhar's other works.[252][253] In some earlier work led by Oswald Veblen von Neumann helped develop basic ideas involving spinors that would lead to Roger Penrose's twistor theory.[254][255] Much of this was done in seminars conducted at the IAS during the 1930s.[256] From this work he wrote a paper with A. H. Taub and Veblen extending the Dirac equation to projective relativity, with a key focus on maintaining invariance with regards to coordinate, spin, and gauge transformations, as a part of early research into potential theories of quantum gravity in the 1930s.[257] In the same time period he made several proposals to colleagues for dealing with the problems in the newly created quantum theory of fields and for quantizing spacetime; however, both his colleagues and he did not consider the ideas fruitful and did not work on them further.[258][259][260] Nevertheless, he maintained at least some interest in these ideas in 1940 writing a manuscript on the Dirac equation in de Sitter space.[261]/nVon Neumann founded the field of game theory as a mathematical discipline.[262] He proved his minimax theorem in 1928. It establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e., in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.[263]/nSuch strategies, which minimize the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). He improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, written with Oskar Morgenstern. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story.[264] In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analysis, especially convex sets and the topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.[262]/nVon Neumann's functional-analytic techniques\u2014the use of duality pairings of real vector spaces to represent prices and quantities, the use of supporting and separating hyperplanes and convex sets, and fixed-point theory\u2014have been primary tools of mathematical economics ever since.[265]/nVon Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several influential publications. For his model of an expanding economy, he proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.[262] Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencil\u00a0 A\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03bbB with nonnegative matrices\u00a0A and B; von Neumann sought probability vectors\u00a0p and\u00a0q and a positive number\u00a0\u03bb that would solve the complementarity equation \n\n\n\n\np\n\nT\n\n\n(\nA\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nB\n)\nq\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p^{T}(A-\\lambda B)q=0}\n\n along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the (transposed) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the \"intensity\" at which the production process would run. The unique solution \u03bb represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the rate of growth of the economy; the rate of growth equals the interest rate.[266][267]/nVon Neumann's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where his model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of his model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics.[268][269] This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality.[270] In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.[271] The lasting importance of the work on general equilibria and the methodology of fixed point theorems is underscored by the awarding of Nobel prizes in 1972 to Kenneth Arrow, in 1983 to G\u00e9rard Debreu, and in 1994 to John Nash who used fixed point theorems to establish equilibria for non-cooperative games and for bargaining problems in his Ph.D. thesis. Arrow and Debreu also used linear programming, as did Nobel laureates Tjalling Koopmans, Leonid Kantorovich, Wassily Leontief, Paul Samuelson, Robert Dorfman, Robert Solow, and Leonid Hurwicz.[272]/nVon Neumann's famous 9-page paper started life as a talk at Princeton and then became a paper in German that was eventually translated into English. His interest in economics that led to that paper began while he was lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929. He spent his summers back home in Budapest, as did the economist Nicholas Kaldor, and they hit it off. Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist L\u00e9on Walras. Von Neumann found some faults in the book and corrected them\u2013for example, replacing equations by inequalities. He noticed that Walras's General Equilibrium Theory and Walras's law, which led to systems of simultaneous linear equations, could produce the absurd result that profit could be maximized by producing and selling a negative quantity of a product. He replaced the equations by inequalities, introduced dynamic equilibria, among other things, and eventually produced the paper.[273]/nBuilding on his results on matrix games and on his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming when George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, and an impatient von Neumann asked him to get to the point. Dantzig then listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hourlong lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.[274]/nLater, von Neumann suggested a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Paul Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.[275]/nVon Neumann was a founding figure in computing,[276] with significant contributions to computing hardware design, to theoretical computer science to scientific computing, and to the philosophy of computer science./nVon Neumann consulted for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, most notably on the ENIAC project,[277] as a member of its Scientific Advisory Committee.[278] Although the single-memory, stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture, the architecture was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, inventors of ENIAC and its successor, EDVAC.\nWhile consulting for the EDVAC project at the University of Pennsylvania, von Neumann wrote an incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. The paper, whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of Eckert and Mauchly, described a computer that stored both its data and its program in the same address space, unlike the earliest computers which stored their programs separately on paper tape or plugboards. This architecture became the basis of most modern computer designs.[279]/nNext, von Neumann designed the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. Von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer, include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful IBM 704.[280][281]/nVon Neumann was the inventor, in 1945, of the merge sort algorithm, in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.[282][283]/nAs part of Von Neumann's hydrogen bomb work, he and Stanis\u0142aw Ulam developed simulations for hydrodynamic computations. He also contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method, which used random numbers to approximate the solutions to complicated problems.[284]/nVon Neumann's algorithm for simulating a fair coin with a biased coin is used in the \"software whitening\" stage of some hardware random number generators.[285] Because obtaining \"truly\" random numbers was impractical, von Neumann developed a form of pseudorandomness, using the middle-square method. He justified this crude method as faster than any other method at his disposal, writing that \"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\"[285] He also noted that when this method went awry it did so obviously, unlike other methods which could be subtly incorrect.[285]/nStochastic computing was introduced by von Neumann in 1953.[286] but could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s.[287][288] Around 1950 he was also among the first people to talk about the time complexity of computations, which eventually evolved into the field of computational complexity theory.[289]/nVon Neumann's rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA.[291] Ulam and von Neumann are also generally credited with creating the field of cellular automata, beginning in the 1940s, as a simplified mathematical model of biological systems.[citation needed]/nIn lectures in 1948 and 1949, von Neumann proposed a kinematic self-reproducing automaton.[292][293] By 1952, John von Neumann was treating the problem more abstractly. He designed an elaborate 2D cellular automaton that would automatically make a copy of its initial configuration of cells.[294]  The Von Neumann universal constructor based on the von Neumann cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous Theory of Self Reproducing Automata.[295]\nThe von Neumann neighborhood, in which each cell in a two-dimensional grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues to be used for other cellular automata.[296]/nConsidered to be possibly \"the most influential researcher in scientific computing of all time\",[297] von Neumann made several contributions to the field, both technically and administratively. He developed the Von Neumann stability analysis procedure,[298] still commonly used to avoid errors from building up in numerical methods for linear partial differential equations.[299] His paper with Herman Goldstine in 1947 was the first to describe backward error analysis, although implicitly.[300] He was also one of the first to write about the Jacobi method.[301] At Los Alamos, he wrote several classified reports on solving problems of gas dynamics numerically. However, he was frustrated by the lack of progress with analytic methods for these nonlinear problems. As a result, he turned towards computational methods.[302] Under his influence Los Alamos became the undisputed leader in computational science during the 1950s and early 1960s.[303]/nFrom this work von Neumann realized that computation was not just a tool to brute force the solution to a problem numerically, but could also provide insight for solving problems analytically,[304] and that there was an enormous variety of scientific and engineering problems towards which computers would be useful, most significant of which were nonlinear problems.[305] In June 1945 at the First Canadian Mathematical Congress he gave his first talk on general ideas of how to solve problems, particularly of fluid dynamics numerically.[247] He also described how wind tunnels were actually analog computers, and how digital computers would replace them and bring a new era of fluid dynamics. Garrett Birkhoff described it as \"an unforgettable sales pitch\". He expanded this talk with Goldstine into the manuscript \"On the Principles of Large Scale Computing Machines\" and used it to promote the support of scientific computing. His papers also developed the concepts of inverting matrices, random matrices and automated relaxation methods for solving elliptic boundary value problems.[306]/nAs part of his research into possible applications of computers, von Neumann became interested in weather prediction, noting the similarities between the problems in the field and previous problems he had worked on during the Manhattan Project, both of which involved nonlinear fluid dynamics.[307] In 1946 von Neumann founded the \"Meteorological Project\" at the Institute for Advanced Study, securing funding for his project from the Weather Bureau along with the US Air Force and US Navy weather services.[308] With Carl-Gustaf Rossby, considered the leading theoretical meteorologist at the time, he gathered a twenty strong group of meteorologists who began to work on various problems in the field. However, as other postwar work took up considerable portions of his time he was not able to devote enough of it to proper leadership of the project and little was done during this time period./nThis changed when a young Jule Gregory Charney took up co-leadership of the project from Rossby.[309] By 1950 von Neumann and Charney wrote the world's first climate modelling software, and used it to perform the world's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer that von Neumann had arranged to be used;[308] von Neumann and his team published the results as Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation.[310] Together they played a leading role in efforts to integrate sea-air exchanges of energy and moisture into the study of climate.[311] Though primitive, news of the ENIAC forecasts quickly spread around the world and a number of parallel projects in other locations were initiated.[312]/nIn 1955 von Neumann, Charney and their collaborators convinced their funders to open up the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU) in Suitland, Maryland which began routine real-time weather forecasting.[313] Next up, von Neumann proposed a research program for climate modeling: \"The approach is to first try short-range forecasts, then long-range forecasts of those properties of the circulation that can perpetuate themselves over arbitrarily long periods of time, and only finally to attempt forecast for medium-long time periods which are too long to treat by simple hydrodynamic theory and too short to treat by the general principle of equilibrium theory.\"[314] Positive results of Norman A. Phillips in 1955 prompted immediate reaction and von Neumann organized a conference at Princeton on \"Application of Numerical Integration Techniques to the Problem of the General Circulation\". Once again he strategically organized the program as a predictive one in order to ensure continued support from the Weather Bureau and the military, leading to the creation of the General Circulation Research Section (now known as the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) next to the JNWPU in Suitland, Maryland.[315] He continued work both on technical issues of modelling and in ensuring continuing funding for these projects, which, like many others, were enormously helped by von Neumann's unwavering support to legitimize them.[316]/nDuring the late 19th century, Svante Arrhenius suggested that human activity could cause global warming by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.[317] In 1955, von Neumann observed that this may already have begun: \"Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by industry's burning of coal and oil - more than half of it during the last generation - may have changed the atmosphere's composition sufficiently to account for a general warming of the world by about one degree Fahrenheit.\"[318][319] His research into weather systems and meteorological prediction led him to propose manipulating the environment by spreading colorants on the polar ice caps to enhance absorption of solar radiation (by reducing the albedo).[320][321][320][321]  However, he urged caution in any program of atmosphere modification: \"What could be done, of course, is no index to what should be done... In fact, to evaluate the ultimate consequences of either a general cooling or a general heating would be a complex matter. Changes would affect the level of the seas, and hence the habitability of the continental coastal shelves; the evaporation of the seas, and hence general precipitation and glaciation levels; and so on... But there is little doubt that one could carry out the necessary analyses needed to predict the results, intervene on any desired scale, and ultimately achieve rather fantastic results.\"[319] He also warned that weather and climate control could have military uses, telling Congress in 1956 that they could pose an even bigger risk than ICBMs.[322]/n\"The technology that is now developing and that will dominate the next decades is in conflict with traditional, and, in the main, momentarily still valid, geographical and political units and concepts. This is a maturing crisis of technology... The most hopeful answer is that the human species has been subjected to similar tests before and it seems to have a congenital ability to come through, after varying amounts of trouble.\"/n\u2014von Neumann, 1955[319]/nThe first use of the concept of a singularity in the technological context is attributed to von Neumann,[323] who according to Ulam discussed the \"ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.\"[324] This concept was fleshed out later in the book Future Shock by Alvin Toffler./nBeginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann developed an expertise in explosions\u2014phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically. During this period, von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of shaped charges. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the Manhattan Project. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities at the Los Alamos Laboratory in a remote part of New Mexico.[38]/nVon Neumann made his principal contribution to the atomic bomb in the concept and design of the explosive lenses that were needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki. In addition, he helped determine which Japanese cities the atomic bombs would be used on, and was also the singular person responsible for the complex calculations needed to determine at which height the bombs would be detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to achieve the maximum kill rate\u20141,800 feet (550\u00a0m).[325] While von Neumann did not originate the \"implosion\" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of \"assembly\".[326]/nWhen it turned out that there would not be enough uranium-235 to make more than one bomb, the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann's idea was implemented. Implosion was the only method that could be used with the plutonium-239 that was available from the Hanford Site.[327] He established the design of the explosive lenses required, but there remained concerns about \"edge effects\" and imperfections in the explosives.[328] His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry.[329] After a series of failed attempts with models, this was achieved by George Kistiakowsky, and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945.[330]/nIn a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90\u00b0 and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.[331][332]/nVon Neumann, four other scientists, and various military personnel were included in the target selection committee that was responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice,[333] a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.[334]/nOn July 16, 1945, von Neumann and numerous other Manhattan Project personnel were eyewitnesses to the first test of an atomic bomb detonation, which was code-named Trinity. The event was conducted as a test of the implosion method device, at the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield, 35 miles (56\u00a0km) southeast of Socorro, New Mexico. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to 5 kilotons of TNT (21\u00a0TJ) but Enrico Fermi produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.[335] It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression \"kilotons\" appeared for the first time.[336] After the war, Robert Oppenheimer remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had \"known sin\". Von Neumann's response was that \"sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it.\"[337]/nVon Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with Edward Teller, one of those who sustained the hydrogen bomb project. He collaborated with Klaus Fuchs on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on \"Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy\", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate nuclear fusion.[338] The Fuchs\u2013von Neumann patent used radiation implosion, but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the Teller\u2013Ulam design. Their work was, however, incorporated into the \"George\" shot of Operation Greenhouse, which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design.[339] The Fuchs\u2013von Neumann work was passed on to the Soviet Union by Fuchs as part of his nuclear espionage, but it was not used in the Soviets' own, independent development of the Teller\u2013Ulam design. The historian Jeremy Bernstein has pointed out that ironically, \"John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made.\"[339]/nFor his wartime services, von Neumann was awarded the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award in July 1946, and the Medal for Merit in October 1946.[340]/nIn 1950, von Neumann became a consultant to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG),[341] whose function was to advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of Defense on the development and use of new technologies.[342] He also became an adviser to the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons.[341] Over the following two years, he became a consultant across the US government.[343] This included the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission, a consultant to the newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force[341] During this time he became a \"superstar\" defense scientist at the Pentagon. His authority was considered infallible at the highest levels of the US government and military.[344]/nDuring several meetings of the advisory board of the US Air Force von Neumann and Edward Teller predicted that by 1960 the US would be able to build a hydrogen bomb, one not only powerful but light enough to fit on top of a rocket. In 1953 Bernard Schriever, who was present at the meeting with Teller and von Neumann, paid a personal visit to von Neumann at Princeton in order to confirm this possibility.[345] Schriever would then enlist Trevor Gardner, who in turn would also personally visit von Neumann several weeks later in order to fully understand the future possibilities before beginning his campaign for such a weapon in Washington.[346] Now either chairing or serving on several boards dealing with strategic missiles and nuclear weaponry, von Neumann was able to inject several crucial arguments regarding potential Soviet advancements in both these areas and in strategic defenses against American bombers into government reports in order to argue for the creation of ICBMs.[347] Gardner on several occasions would bring von Neumann to meetings with the US Department of Defense to discuss with various senior officials his reports.[348] Several design decisions in these reports such as inertial guidance mechanisms would form the basis for all ICBMs thereafter.[349] By 1954, von Neumann was also regularly testifying to various Congressional military subcommittees to ensure continued support for the ICBM program, which would later expand to include senior officials from all over the US government.[350]/nHowever, this was not enough. In order to have the ICBM program run at full throttle they needed direct action by the President of the United States.[351] They managed to convince President Eisenhower in a direct meeting in July 1955, which resulted in a presidential directive on September 13, 1955. It stated that \"there would be the gravest repercussions on the national security and on the cohesion of the free world\" if the Soviet Union developed the ICBM before America did and therefore designated the ICBM project \"a research and development program of the highest priority above all others.\" The Secretary of Defense was ordered to commence the project with \"maximum urgency\".[352] From the first time Schriever heard the presentation of von Neumann and Teller to the signing of the presidential directive the trio had moved heaven and earth in order to make the ICBM program a reality.[353] Evidence would later show that the Soviets indeed were already testing their own intermediate-range ballistic missiles at the time of the presentation to President Eisenhower at the White House.[354] Von Neumann would continue to meet the President, including at his home in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and other high-level government officials as a key advisor on ICBMs until his death.[355]/nIn 1955, von Neumann became a commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which at the time was the highest official position available to scientists in the government.[356] (While his appointment formally required that he sever all his other consulting contracts,[357] an exemption was made for von Neumann to continue working with several critical military committees after the Air Force and several key senators raised concerns.[355]) He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate-range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case.[358][359] Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.[360] While Lewis Strauss was away in the second half of 1955 von Neumann took over as acting chairman of the commission.[361]/nIn his final years before his death from cancer, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, which would sometimes meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death.[362] The more advanced Titan rockets were deployed in 1962. Both had been proposed in the ICBM committees von Neumann chaired.[355] The feasibility of the ICBMs owed as much to improved, smaller warheads that did not have guidance or heat resistance issues as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.[362][355]/nVon Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism.[63] During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as \"violently anti-communist, and much more militaristic than the norm\".[363][364]/nHerman Goldstine commented on von Neumann's ability to intuit hidden errors and to remember old material perfectly.[365][366] When he had difficulties he would not labor on and struggle; instead, he would go home and sleep on it and come back later with a solution.[367] This style, 'taking the path of least resistance', sometimes meant that he could go off on tangents. It also meant that if the difficulty was great from the very beginning, he would simply switch to another problem, not trying to find weak spots from which he could break through.[368] At times he could be ignorant of the standard mathematical literature, finding it easier to rederive basic information he needed rather than chase references.[369]/nAfter World War II began, he became extremely busy with both academic and military commitments. His habit of not writing up talks or publishing results he found worsened.[370] He did not find it easy to discuss a topic formally in writing to others unless it was already mature in his mind; if it was not, he would, in his own words, \"develop the worst traits of pedantism and inefficiency\".[371]/nThe mathematician Jean Dieudonn\u00e9 said that von Neumann \"may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group, the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions\".[161] According to Dieudonn\u00e9, his specific genius was in analysis and \"combinatorics\", with combinatorics being understood in a very wide sense that described his ability to organize and axiomize complex works that previously seemed to have little connection with mathematics. His style in analysis followed the German school, based on foundations in linear algebra and general topology. While von Neumann had an encyclopedic background, his range in pure mathematics was not as wide as Poincar\u00e9, Hilbert or even Weyl: von Neumann never did significant work in number theory, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry or differential geometry; however, in applied mathematics his work equalled that of legendary mathematicians such as Gauss, Cauchy or Poincar\u00e9. During the 1930s when von Neumann's work in pure mathematics was at its peak, there was hardly an important area he didn't have at least passing acquaintance with.[117]/nAccording to Wigner, \"Nobody knows all science, not even von Neumann did. But as for mathematics, he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology. That is, I think, something unique.\"[372] Likewise, Halmos noted that while von Neumann knew lots of mathematics, the most notable gaps were in algebraic topology and number theory; he recalled an incident where von Neumann failed to recognize the topological definition of a torus written on a blackboard.[373] Von Neumann admitted to Herman Goldstine that he had no facility at all in topology and he was never comfortable with it, with Goldstine later bringing this up when comparing him to Hermann Weyl, whom he thought was deeper and broader than von Neumann.[367] Similarly, Albert Tucker said he never saw von Neumann work on anything he would call \"topological\" and described how once von Neumann was giving a proof of a topological theorem, which he thought, while ingenious, was the kind of proof an analyst would give rather than someone who worked on combinatorial topology.[374]/nIn his biography of von Neumann, Salomon Bochner wrote that much of von Neumann's works in pure mathematics involved finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces in one way or another, which at the time, covered much of the total area of mathematics. However he pointed out this still did not cover an important part of the mathematical landscape, in particular, anything that involved geometry \"in the global sense\", topics such as topology, differential geometry and harmonic integrals, algebraic geometry and other such fields. Von Neumann rarely worked in these fields and, as Bochner saw it, had little affinity for them.[130]/nIn one of von Neumann's last articles, he lamented that pure mathematicians could no longer attain deep knowledge of even a fraction of the field.[375] In the early 1940s, Ulam had concocted for him a doctoral-style examination in various fields to find weaknesses in his knowledge; von Neumann was unable to answer satisfactorily a question each in differential geometry, number theory, and algebra. They concluded that doctoral exams might have \"little permanent meaning\". However, when Weyl turned down an offer to write a history of mathematics of the 20th century, arguing that no one person could do it, Ulam thought von Neumann could have aspired to do so.[376]/nUlam remarked that most mathematicians could master one technique that they then used repeatedly, whereas von Neumann had mastered three:/nAlthough he was commonly described as an analyst, he once classified himself an algebraist,[378] and his style often displayed a mix of algebraic technique and set-theoretical intuition.[379] He loved obsessive detail and had no issues with excess repetition or overly explicit notation. An example of this was a paper of his on rings of operators, where he extended the normal functional notation, \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi (x)}\n\n to \n\n\n\n\u03d5\n(\n(\nx\n)\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\phi ((x))}\n\n. However, this process ended up being repeated several times, where the final result were equations such as \n\n\n\n(\n\u03c8\n(\n(\n(\n(\na\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\n)\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\u03d5\n(\n(\n(\n(\na\n)\n)\n)\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (\\psi ((((a)))))^{2}=\\phi ((((a))))}\n\n. The 1936 paper became known to students as \"von Neumann's onion\"[380] because the equations \"needed to be peeled before they could be digested\". Overall, although his writings were clear and powerful, they were not clean, or elegant.[381] Although powerful technically, his primary concern seemed to be more with the clear and viable formation of fundamental issues and questions of science rather than just the solution of mathematical puzzles.[380]/nAccording to Ulam, von Neumann surprised physicists by doing dimensional estimates and algebraic computations in his head with fluency Ulam likened to blindfold chess. His impression was that von Neumann analyzed physical situations by abstract logical deduction rather than concrete visualization.[382]/nGoldstine compared his lectures to being on glass, smooth and lucid. By comparison, Goldstine thought his scientific articles were written in a much harsher manner, and with much less insight.[58] Halmos described his lectures as \"dazzling\", with his speech clear, rapid, precise and all encompassing. Like Goldstine, he also described how everything seemed \"so easy and natural\" in lectures but puzzling on later reflection.[369] He was a quick speaker: Banesh Hoffmann found it very difficult to take notes, even in shorthand,[383] and Albert Tucker said that people often had to ask von Neumann questions in order to slow him down so they could think through the ideas he was going through. Von Neumann knew about this and was grateful for his audience telling him when he was going too quickly.[374] Although he did spend time preparing for lectures, he rarely used notes, instead jotting down points of what he would discuss and how long he would spend on it.[369]/nVon Neumann was also noted for his eidetic memory, particularly of the symbolic kind. Herman Goldstine writes:/nOne of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.[384]/nVon Neumann was reportedly able to memorize the pages of telephone directories. He entertained friends by asking them to randomly call out page numbers; he then recited the names, addresses and numbers therein.[29][385] Per Stanis\u0142aw Ulam, von Neumann's memory was auditory rather than visual.[386]/nVon Neumann's mathematical fluency, calculation speed, and general problem-solving ability were widely noted by his peers. Paul Halmos called his speed \"awe-inspiring.\"[387] Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described him as the \"fastest mind I ever met\".[388] Enrico Fermi told physicist Herbert L. Anderson: \"You know, Herb, Johnny can do calculations in his head ten times as fast as I can! And I can do them ten times as fast as you can, Herb, so you can see how impressive Johnny is!\"[389] Edward Teller admitted that he \"never could keep up with him\",[390] and Israel Halperin described trying to keep up as like riding a \"tricycle chasing a racing car.\"[391]/nHe had an unusual ability to solve novel problems quickly. George P\u00f3lya, whose lectures at ETH Z\u00fcrich von Neumann attended as a student, said, \"Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of. If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper.\"[392] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming \"as I would to an ordinary mortal\", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said \"Oh, that!\", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.[393]/nA story about von Neumann's encounter with the famous fly puzzle[394] has entered mathematical folklore. In this puzzle, two bicycles begin 20 miles apart, and each travels toward the other at 10 miles per hour until they collide; meanwhile, a fly travels continuously back and forth between the bicycles at 15 miles per hour until it is squashed in the collision. The questioner asks how far the fly traveled in total; the \"trick\" for a quick answer is to realize that the fly's individual transits do not matter, only that it has been traveling at 15 miles per hour for one hour. As Eugene Wigner tells it,[395] it was Max Born who posed the riddle to von Neumann. The other scientists to whom he had posed it had laboriously computed the distance, so when von Neumann was immediately ready with the correct answer of 15 miles, Born observed that he must have guessed the trick. \"What trick?\" von Neumann replied. \"All I did was sum the geometric series.\"[396]/nRota, in describing von Neumann's relationship with his friend Stanis\u0142aw Ulam, wrote that von Neumann had \"deep-seated and recurring self-doubts\".[397] As an example on one occasion he said in the future he would be forgotten while G\u00f6del would be remembered with Pythagoras.[398] Ulam suggests that some of his self-doubts with regard for his own creativity may have come from the fact he had not discovered several important ideas that others had, even though he was more than capable of doing so, giving the incompleteness theorems and Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem as examples. Von Neumann had a virtuosity in following complicated reasoning and had supreme insights, yet he perhaps felt he did not have the gift for seemingly irrational proofs and theorems or intuitive insights that came from nowhere. Ulam describes how during one of his stays at Princeton while von Neumann was working on rings of operators, continuous geometries and quantum logic he felt that von Neumann was not convinced of the importance of his work, and only when finding some ingenious technical trick or new approach that he took some pleasure from his work that satiated his concerns.[399] However, according to Rota, von Neumann still had an \"incomparably stronger technique\" compared to his friend, despite describing Ulam as the more creative mathematician.[397]/nNobel Laureate Hans Bethe said \"I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man\".[29] Edward Teller observed \"von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.\"[400] Peter Lax wrote \"Von Neumann was addicted to thinking, and in particular to thinking about mathematics\".[370] Eugene Wigner said, \"He understood mathematical problems not only in their initial aspect, but in their full complexity.\"[401] Claude Shannon called him \"the smartest person I've ever met\", a common opinion.[402] Jacob Bronowski wrote \"He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception. He was a genius.\"[403]/n\"It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived,\" wrote Mikl\u00f3s R\u00e9dei.[404] Peter Lax commented that von Neumann would have won a Nobel Prize in Economics had he lived longer, and that \"if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too.\"[405] Rota writes that \"he was the first to have a vision of the boundless possibilities of computing, and he had the resolve to gather the considerable intellectual and engineering resources that led to the construction of the first large computer\" and consequently that \"No other mathematician in this century has had as deep and lasting an influence on the course of civilization.\"[406] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential mathematicians and scientists of the 20th century.[407]/nAccolades and anecdotes were not limited to those from the physical or mathematical sciences. Neurophysiologist Leon Harmon described him in a similar manner, calling him the only \"true genius\" he had ever met: \"The others were supersmart .... And great prima donnas. But von Neumann's mind was all-encompassing. He could solve problems in any domain. ... And his mind was always working, always restless.\"[408] While consulting for non-academic projects von Neumann's combination of outstanding scientific ability and practicality gave him a high credibility with military officers, engineers, industrialists and scientists that no other scientist could match. In nuclear missilery he was considered \"the clearly dominant advisory figure\" according to Herbert York.[409] Economist Nicholas Kaldor said he was \"unquestionably the nearest thing to a genius I have ever encountered.\"[270] Likewise, Paul Samuelson wrote, \"We economists are grateful for von Neumann's genius. It is not for us to calculate whether he was a Gauss, or a Poincar\u00e9, or a Hilbert. He was the incomparable Johnny von Neumann. He darted briefly into our domain and it has never been the same since.\"[410]/nEvents and awards named in recognition of von Neumann include the annual John von Neumann Theory Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences,[411] IEEE John von Neumann Medal,[412] and the John von Neumann Prize of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.[413] Both the crater von Neumann on the Moon[414] and the asteroid 22824 von Neumann are named in his honor.[415][416]/nVon Neumann received awards including the Medal for Merit in 1947, the Medal of Freedom in 1956,[417] and the Enrico Fermi Award also in 1956. He was elected a member of multiple honorary societies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, and he held eight honorary doctorates.[418][419][420] On May 4, 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the American Scientists commemorative postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations designed by artist Victor Stabin. The scientists depicted were von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Richard Feynman.[421]/nJohn von Neumann University\u00a0[hu] was established in Kecskem\u00e9t, Hungary in 2016, as a successor to Kecskem\u00e9t College.[422]/nVon Neumann's first published paper was On the position of zeroes of certain minimum polynomials, co-authored with Michael Fekete and published when von Neumann was 18. At 19, his solo paper On the introduction of transfinite numbers was published.[423] He expanded his second solo paper, An axiomatization of set theory, to create his PhD thesis.[424] His first book, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, was published in 1932.[425] Following this, von Neumann switched from publishing in German to publishing in English, and his publications became more selective and expanded beyond pure mathematics. His 1942 Theory of Detonation Waves contributed to military research,[426] his work on computing began with the unpublished 1946 On the principles of large scale computing machines, and his publications on weather prediction began with the 1950 Numerical integration of the barotropic vorticity equation.[427] Alongside his later papers were informal essays targeted at colleagues and the general public, such as his 1947 The Mathematician,[428] described as a \"farewell to pure mathematics\", and his 1955 Can we survive technology?, which considered a bleak future including nuclear warfare and deliberate climate change.[429] His complete works have been compiled into a six-volume set.[423]/nvon Neumann, John (1932). \"Physical Applications of the Ergodic Hypothesis\".

He is best known for his work on algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields./nAlong with Emmy Noether, he is considered the founder of modern abstract algebra./nEmil Artin was born in Vienna to parents Emma Maria, n\u00e9e Laura (stage name Clarus), a soubrette on the operetta stages of Austria and Germany, and Emil Hadochadus Maria Artin,[citation needed] Austrian-born of mixed Austrian and Armenian descent. His Armenian last name was  Artinian which was shortened to Artin.[1][2][3] Several documents, including Emil's birth certificate,[citation needed] list the father's occupation as \"opera singer\" though others list it as \"art dealer.\" It seems at least plausible that he and Emma had met as colleagues in the theater. They were married in St. Stephen's Parish on July 24, 1895./nArtin entered school in September 1904, presumably in Vienna. By then, his father was already suffering symptoms of advanced syphilis, among them increasing mental instability, and was eventually institutionalized at the recently established (and imperially sponsored) insane asylum at Mauer \u00d6hling, 125 kilometers west of Vienna.  It is notable that neither wife nor child contracted this highly infectious disease. Artin's father died there July 20, 1906.  Young Artin was eight./nOn July 15, 1907, Artin's mother remarried to Rudolf H\u00fcbner: a prosperous manufacturing entrepreneur from Reichenberg, Bohemia (now Liberec in the Czech Republic). Documentary evidence suggests that Emma had already been a resident in Reichenberg the previous year, and in deference to her new husband, she had abandoned her vocal career. H\u00fcbner deemed a life in the theater unseemly\u2014unfit for the wife of a man of his position./nIn September 1907, Artin entered the Volksschule in Horn\u00ed Stropnice. For that year, he lived away from home, boarding on a local farm. The following year, he returned to the home of his mother and stepfather, and entered the Realschule in Reichenberg, where he pursued his secondary education until June 1916./nIn Reichenberg, Artin formed a lifelong friendship with a young neighbor, Arthur Baer, who became an astronomer, teaching for many years at University of Cambridge. Astronomy was an interest the two boys shared already at this time. They each had telescopes. They also rigged a telegraph between their houses, over which once Baer excitedly reported to his friend an astronomical discovery he thought he had made\u2014perhaps a supernova, he thought\u2014and told Artin where in the sky to look. Artin tapped back the terse reply \"A-N-D-R-O-M-E-D-A N-E-B-E-L.\" (Andromeda nebula)/nArtin's academic performance in the first years at the Realschule was spotty. Up to the end of the 1911\u20131912 school year, for instance, his grade in mathematics was merely \"gen\u00fcgend,\" (satisfactory). Of his mathematical inclinations at this early period he later wrote, \"Meine eigene Vorliebe zur Mathematik zeigte sich erst im sechzehnten Lebensjahr, w\u00e4hrend vorher von irgendeiner Anlage dazu \u00fcberhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte.\" (\"My own predilection for mathematics manifested itself only in my sixteenth year; before that, one could certainly not speak of any particular aptitude for it.\") His grade in French for 1912 was actually \"nicht gen\u00fcgend\" (unsatisfactory). He did rather better work in physics and chemistry. But from 1910 to 1912, his grade for \"Comportment\" was \"nicht gen\u00fcgend.\"/nArtin spent the school year 1912\u20131913 away from home, in France, a period he spoke of later as one of the happiest of his life. He lived that year with the family of Edmond Fritz, in the vicinity of Paris, and attended a school there. When he returned from France to Reichenberg, his academic work markedly improved, and he began consistently receiving grades of \"gut\" or \"sehr gut\" (good or very good) in virtually all subjects\u2014including French and \"Comportment.\" By the time he completed studies at the Realschule in June 1916, he was awarded the Reifezeugnis (diploma\u2014not to be confused with the Abitur) that affirmed him \"reif mit Auszeichnung\" (qualified with distinction) for graduation to a technical university./nNow that it was time to move on to university studies, Artin was no doubt content to leave Reichenberg, for relations with his stepfather were clouded. According to him, H\u00fcbner reproached him \"day and night\" with being a financial burden, and even when Artin became a university lecturer and then a professor, H\u00fcbner deprecated his academic career as self-indulgent and belittled its paltry emolument./nIn October 1916, Artin matriculated at the University of Vienna, having focused by now on mathematics. He studied there with Philipp Furtw\u00e4ngler, and also took courses in astrophysics and Latin./nStudies at Vienna were interrupted when Artin was drafted in June 1918 into the Austrian army (his Army photo ID is dated July 1, 1918). Assigned to the K.u. K. 44th Infantry Regiment, he was stationed northwest of Venice at Primolano, on the Italian front in the foothills of the Dolomites. To his great relief, Artin managed to avoid combat by volunteering for service as a translator\u2014his ignorance of Italian notwithstanding. He did know French, of course, and some Latin, was generally a quick study, and was motivated by a highly rational fear in a theater of that war that had often proven a meat-grinder. In his scramble to learn at least some Italian, Artin had recourse to an encyclopedia, which he once consulted for help in dealing with the cockroaches that infested the Austrian barracks. At some length, the article described a variety of technical methods, concluding finally with\u2014Artin laughingly recalled in later years\u2014\"la caccia diretta\" (\"the direct hunt\"). Indeed, \"la caccia diretta\" was the straightforward method he and his fellow infantrymen adopted./nArtin survived both war and vermin on the Italian front, and returned late in 1918 to the University of Vienna, where he remained through Easter of the following year./nBy June 1919, he had moved to Leipzig and matriculated at the university there as a \"Class 2 Auditor\" (\"H\u00f6rer zweiter Ordnung\").  Late the same year, Artin undertook the formality of standing for a qualifying examination by an academic board of the Oberrealschule in Leipzig, which he passed with the grade of \"gut\" (good), receiving for the second time the Reifezeugnis (diploma attesting the equivalence of satisfactory completion of 6 years at a Realschule). How this Leipzig Reifezeugnis differed technically from the one he had been granted at Reichenberg is unclear from the document, but it apparently qualified him for regular matriculation as a student at the university, which normally required the Abitur./nFrom 1919 to June 1921, Artin pursued mostly mathematical studies at Leipzig.  His principal teacher and dissertation advisor was Gustav Herglotz. Additionally, Artin took courses in chemistry and various fields of physics, including mechanics, atomic theory, quantum theory, Maxwellian theory, radioactivity, and astrophysics. In June 1921 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree, based on his \"excellent\" dissertation, \"Quadratische K\u00f6rper im Gebiete der h\u00f6heren Kongruenzen\" (\"On the Arithmetic of Quadratic Function Fields over Finite Fields\"), and the oral examination which\u2014his diploma affirms\u2014he had passed three days earlier \"with extraordinary success.\"/nIn the fall of 1921, Artin moved to the University of G\u00f6ttingen, considered the \"Mecca\" of mathematics at the time, where he pursued one year of post-doctoral studies in mathematics and mathematical physics with Richard Courant and David Hilbert. While at G\u00f6ttingen, he worked closely with Emmy Noether and Helmut Hasse./nAside from consistently good school grades in singing, the first documentary evidence of Artin's deep and lifelong engagement with music comes from the year in G\u00f6ttingen, where he was regularly invited to join in the chamber music sessions hosted by Richard Courant. He played all the keyboard instruments, and was an especially accomplished flautist, although it is not known exactly by what instruction he had achieved proficiency on these instruments. He became especially devoted to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach./nCourant arranged for Artin to receive a stipend for the summer of 1922 in G\u00f6ttingen, which occasioned his declining a position offered him at the University of Kiel. The following October, however, he accepted an equivalent position at Hamburg, where in 1923, he completed the Habilitation thesis (required of aspirants to a professorship in Germany), and on July 24 advanced to the rank of Privatdozent./nOn April 1, 1925, Artin was promoted to Associate Professor (au\u00dferordentlicher Professor). In this year also, Artin applied for and was granted German citizenship. He was promoted to full Professor (ordentlicher Professor) on October 15, 1926./nEarly in the summer of 1925, Artin attended the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near Kassel with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through Iceland later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during World War II) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure.  Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to Norway, where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, H\u00fasav\u00edk in the north of the island.  Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Lax\u00e1 River to Lake M\u00fdvatn.  They made a circuit of the large, irregular lake, staying in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well./nArtin kept a meticulous journal of this trip, making daily entries in a neat, minuscule hand. He and several of the young men had brought cameras, so that the trek is documented also by nearly 200 small photographs.[4]  Artin's journal attests to his overarching interest in the geology of this mid-Atlantic island, situated over the boundary of two tectonic plates whose shifting relation makes it geologically hyperactive./nIn keeping with the Wandervogel ethos, Artin and his companions carried music with them wherever they visited. The young men had packed guitars and violins, and Artin played the harmoniums common in the isolated farmsteads where they found lodging. The group regularly entertained their Icelandic hosts, not in full exchange for board and lodging, to be sure, but for goodwill certainly, and sometimes for a little extra on their plates, or a modestly discounted tariff./nFrom Lake M\u00fdvatn, Artin and his companions headed west towards Akureyri, passing the large waterfall Go\u00f0afoss on the way. From Akureyri, they trekked west down the \u00d6xnadalur (Ox Valley) intending to rent pack horses and cross the high and barren interior by foot to Reykjav\u00edk. By the time they reached the lower end of Skagafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, however, they were persuaded by a local farmer from whom they had hoped to rent the horses that a cross-country trek was by then impracticable; with the approach of winter, highland routes were already snow-bound and impassable.  Instead of turning south, then, they turned north to Siglufj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, where they boarded another steamer that took them around the western peninsula and down the coast to Reykjav\u00edk.  From Reykjav\u00edk, they returned via Norway to Hamburg. By Artin's calculation the distance they had covered on foot through Iceland totaled 450 kilometers./nEarly in 1926, the University of M\u00fcnster offered Artin a professorial position; however, Hamburg matched the offer financially, and (as noted above) promoted him to full professor, making him (along with his young colleague Helmut Hasse) one of the two youngest professors of mathematics in Germany./nIt was in this period that he acquired his lifelong nickname, \"Ma,\" short for mathematics, which he came to prefer to his given name, and which virtually everyone who knew him well used. Although the nickname might seem to imply a narrow intellectual focus, quite the reverse was true of Artin. Even his teaching at the University of Hamburg went beyond the strict boundaries of mathematics to include mechanics and relativity theory. He kept up on a serious level with advances in astronomy, chemistry and biology (he owned and used a fine microscope), and the circle of his friends in Hamburg attests to the catholicity of his interests. It included the painter Heinrich Stegemann, and the author and organ-builder Hans Henny Jahnn. Stegemann was a particularly close friend, and made portraits of Artin, his wife Natascha, and their two Hamburg-born children. Music continued to play a central role in his life; he acquired a Neupert double manual harpsichord, and a clavichord made by the Hamburg builder Walther Ebeloe, as well as a silver flute made in Hamburg by  G. Urban. Chamber music gatherings became a regular event at the Artin apartment as they had been at the Courants in G\u00f6ttingen./nOn August 15, 1929, Artin married Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha), a young Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who had been a student in several of his classes. One of their shared interests was photography, and when Artin bought a Leica for their joint use (a Leica A, the first commercial model of this legendary camera), Natascha began chronicling the life of the family, as well as the city of Hamburg. For the next decade, she made a series of artful and expressive portraits of Artin that remain by far the best images of him taken at any age. Artin, in turn, took many fine and evocative portraits of Natascha.  Lacking access to a professional darkroom, their films and prints had to be developed in a makeshift darkroom set up each time (and then dismantled again) in the small bathroom of whatever apartment they were occupying.  The makeshift darkroom notwithstanding, the high artistic level of the resulting photographic prints is attested to by the exhibit of Natascha's photographs mounted in 2001 by the Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, and its accompanying catalogue, \"Hamburg\u2014Wie Ich Es Sah.\"/nIn 1930, Artin was offered a professorship at ETH (Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule) in Z\u00fcrich, to replace Hermann Weyl, who had moved to G\u00f6ttingen. He chose to remain at Hamburg, however.  Two years later, in 1932, for contributions leading to the advancement of mathematics, Artin was honored\u2014jointly with Emmy Noether\u2014with the Ackermann\u2013Teubner Memorial Award, which carried a grant of 500 marks./nIn January 1933, Natascha gave birth to their first child, Karin. A year and a half later, in the summer of 1934, son Michael was born. The political climate at Hamburg was not so poisonous as that at G\u00f6ttingen, where by 1935 the mathematics department had been purged of Jewish and dissident professors. Still, Artin's situation became increasingly precarious, not only because Natascha was half Jewish, but also because Artin made no secret of his distaste for the Hitler regime (he evidently signed the 1933 Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State, though he said his name had been added without his knowledge).  At one point, Wilhelm Blaschke, by then a Nazi Party member, but nonetheless solicitous of the Artins\u2019 well-being, warned Artin discreetly to close his classroom door so his frankly anti-Nazi comments could not be heard by passersby in the hallway./nNatascha recalled going down to the newsstand on the corner one day and being warned in hushed tones by the man from whom she and Artin bought their paper that a man had daily been watching their apartment from across the street. Once tipped off, she and Artin became very aware of the watcher (Natascha liked to refer to him as their \"spy\"), and even rather enjoyed the idea of his being forced to follow them on the long walks they loved taking in the afternoons to a caf\u00e9 far out in the countryside./nToying with their watcher on a fine autumn afternoon was one thing, but the atmosphere was in fact growing inexorably serious. Natascha's Jewish father and her sister, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had already left for the U.S. in the summer of 1933. As half-Jewish, Natascha's status was, if not ultimately quite hopeless, certainly not good. Hasse, like Blaschke a nationalistic supporter of the regime, had applied for Party membership, but was nonetheless no anti-Semite. Besides he was a long-time friend and colleague of Artin's. He suggested that the two Artin children\u2014only one quarter Jewish, or in Nazi terminology, \"Mischlinge zweiten Grades\"\u2014might, if a few strategic strings could be pulled, be officially \"aryanized.\" Hasse offered to exert his influence with the Ministry of Education (Kultur- und Schulbeh\u00f6rde, Hochschulwesen), and Artin\u2014not daring to leave any stone unturned, especially with respect to the safety of his children\u2014went along with this effort. He asked his father-in-law, by then resident in Washington D.C., to draft and have notarized an affidavit attesting to the Christian lineage of his late wife, Natascha's mother. Artin submitted this affidavit to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail./nBy this time, to be precise, on July 15, 1937, because of Natascha's status as \"Mischling ersten Grades,\" Artin had lost his post at the university\u2014technically, compelled into early retirement\u2014on the grounds of paragraph 6 of the Act to Restore the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums) of April 7, 1933. Ironically, he had applied only some months earlier, on February 8, 1937, for a leave of absence from the university in order to accept a position offered him at Stanford.  On March 15, 1937, the response had come back denying his application for leave on the grounds that his services to the university were indispensable (\"Da die T\u00e4tigkeit des Professors Dr. Artin an der Universit\u00e4t Hamburg nicht entbehrt werden kann. . .\")./nBy July, when he was summarily \"retired,\" (\"in Ruhestand versetzt\") the position at Stanford University had been filled. However, through the efforts of Richard Courant (by then at New York University), and Solomon Lefschetz at Princeton University, a position was found for him at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana./nThe family must have worked feverishly to prepare for emigration to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment.  Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of money out of the country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double-manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and potato masher to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment.[5]/nOn the morning they were to board the Hamburg-Amerika line ship in Bremerhaven, October 21, 1937, daughter Karin woke with a high temperature. Terrified that should this opportunity be missed, the window of escape from Nazi Germany might close forever, Artin and Natascha chose to risk somehow getting Karin past emigration and customs officials without their noticing her condition. They managed to conceal Karin's feverish state, and without incident boarded the ship. When they landed a week later at Hoboken, New Jersey, Richard Courant and Natascha's father, the Russian agronomist Naum Jasny (then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were on the dock to welcome the family to the United States./nIt was early November 1937 by the time they arrived in South Bend, where Artin joined the faculty at Notre Dame, and taught for the rest of that academic year.  He was offered a permanent position the following year 170 miles to the south at Indiana University, in Bloomington. Shortly after the family resettled there, a second son, Thomas, was born on November 12, 1938./nAfter moving to Bloomington, Artin quickly acquired a piano, and soon after that a Hammond Organ, a recently invented electronic instrument that simulated the sound of a pipe organ. He wanted this instrument in order primarily to play the works of J. S. Bach, and because the pedal set that came with the production model had a range of only two octaves (not quite wide enough for all the Bach pieces), he set about extending its range. Music was a constant presence in the Artin household.  Karin played the cello, and then the piano as well, and Michael played the violin. As in Hamburg, the Artin living room was regularly the venue for amateur chamber music performances./nThe circle of the Artins\u2019 University friends reflected Artin's wide cultural and intellectual interests. Notable among them were Alfred Kinsey and his wife of the Psychology Department, as well as prominent members of the Fine Arts, Art History, Anthropology, German Literature, and Music Departments. For several summer semesters, Artin accepted teaching positions at other universities, viz., Stanford in 1939 and 1940, The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1941 and 1951, and The University of Colorado, in Boulder, in 1953. On each of these occasions, the family accompanied him./nArtin insisted that only German be spoken in the house. Even Tom, born in the U.S., spoke German as his  first language, acquiring English only from his siblings and his playmates in the neighborhood; for the first four or five years of his life, he spoke English with a pronounced German accent. Consistent with his program of maintaining the family's German cultural heritage, Artin gave high priority to regularly reading German literature aloud to the children.  The text was frequently from Goethe's autobiographical Dichtung und Wahrheit, or his poems, \"Erlk\u00f6nig,\" for instance.  Occasionally, he would read from an English text.  Favorites were Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, Charles Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol, and Oscar Wilde\u2019s \"The Canterville Ghost\".  For the Artin children, these readings replaced radio entertainment, which was strictly banned from the house.  There was a radio, but (with the notable exception of Sunday morning broadcasts by E. Power Biggs from the organ at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, to which Artin and Natascha listened still lounging in bed) it was switched on only to hear news of the war.  Similarly, the Artin household would never in years to come harbor a television set.  Once the war had ended, the radio was retired to the rear of a dark closet./nAs German citizens, Artin and Natascha were technically classified as enemy aliens for the duration of the war. On April 12, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe only weeks away, they applied for naturalization as American citizens. American citizenship was granted them on February 7, 1946./nOn the orders of a Hamburg doctor whom he had consulted about a chronic cough, Artin had given up smoking years before. He had vowed not to smoke so long as Adolf Hitler remained in power.  On May 8, 1945, at the news of Germany's surrender and the fall of the Third Reich, Natascha made the mistake of reminding him of this vow, and in lieu of a champagne toast, he indulged in what was intended to be the smoking of a single, celebratory cigarette. Unfortunately, the single cigarette led to a second, and another after that.  Artin returned to heavy smoking for the rest of his life./nIf G\u00f6ttingen had been the \"Mecca\" of mathematics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Princeton, following the decimation of German mathematics under the Nazis, had become the center of the mathematical world in the 1940s. In April 1946, Artin was appointed Professor at Princeton, at a yearly salary of $8,000. The family moved there in the fall of 1946./nNotable among his graduate students at Princeton are Serge Lang, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, and O. Timothy O'Meara. Emil chose also to teach the honors section of Freshman calculus each year.  He was renowned for the elegance of his teaching.  Frei and Roquette write that Artin's \"main medium of communication was teaching and conversation:  in groups, seminars and in smaller circles.  We have many statements of people near to him describing his unpretentious way of communicating with everybody, demanding quick grasp of the essentials but never tired of explaining the necessary. He was open to all kinds of suggestions, and distributed joyfully what he knew.  He liked to teach, also to young students, and his excellent lectures, always well prepared but without written notes, were hailed for their clarity and beauty.\"[6]/nWhenever he was asked whether mathematics was a science, Artin would reply unhesitatingly, \"No. An art.\" His explanation was that: \"[Mathematicians] all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners.  In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements.  Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous.  We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realizing that we have enabled our listeners to see at a glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.\"/nDuring the Princeton years, Artin built a 6-inch (15\u00a0cm) reflecting telescope to plans he found in the magazine Sky and Telescope, which he subscribed to. He spent weeks in the basement attempting to grind the mirror to specifications, without success, and his continued failure to get it right led to increasing frustration.  Then, in California to give a talk, he made a side trip to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he discussed his project with the astronomers. Whether it was their technical advice, or Natascha's intuitive suggestion that it might be too cold in the basement, and that he should try the procedure upstairs in the warmth of his study (which he did), he completed the grinding of the mirror in a matter of days.  With this telescope, he surveyed the night skies over Princeton./nIn September 1955, Artin accepted an invitation to visit Japan. From his letters, it is clear he was treated like royalty by the Japanese mathematical community, and was charmed by the country. He was interested in learning about the diverse threads of Buddhism, and visiting its holy sites.  In a letter home he describes his visit to the temples at Nara. \"Then we were driven to a place nearby, Horiuji where a very beautiful Buddhist temple is. We were received by the abbot, and a priest translated into English. We obtained the first sensible explanation about modern Buddhism. The difficulty of obtaining such an explanation is enormous.  To begin with most Japanese do not know and do not understand our questions. All this is made more complicated by the fact that there are numerous sects and each one has another theory. Since you get your information only piece wise, you cannot put it together.  This results in an absurd picture. I am talking of the present day, not of its original form.\"/nHis letter goes on to outline at length the general eschatological framework of Buddhist belief.  Then he adds, \"By the way, a problem given by the Zens for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?\"/nThe following year, Artin took a leave of absence to return to Germany for the first time since emigration, nearly twenty years earlier. He spent the fall semester at G\u00f6ttingen, and the next at Hamburg.  For the Christmas holidays, he travelled to his birthplace, Vienna, to visit his mother, Vienna being a city he had not seen in decades.  In a letter home he described the experience of his return in a single, oddly laconic sentence:  \"It is kind of amusing to walk through Vienna again.\" In 1957, an honorary doctorate was conferred on Artin by the University of Freiburg.  That fall, he returned to Princeton for what would be his final academic year at that institution. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957.[7]/nArtin's marriage to Natascha had by this time seriously frayed. Though nominally still husband and wife, resident in the same house, they were for all intents and purposes living separate lives. Artin was offered a professorship at Hamburg, and at the conclusion of Princeton's spring semester, 1958, he moved permanently to Germany.  His decision to leave Princeton University and the United States was complicated, based on multiple factors, prominent among them Princeton's (then operative) mandatory retirement age of 65. Artin had no wish to retire from teaching and direct involvement with students.  Hamburg's offer was open-ended./nArtin and Natascha were divorced in 1959. In Hamburg, Artin had taken an apartment, but soon gave it over to his mother whom he had brought from Vienna to live near him in Hamburg. He in turn moved into the apartment of the mathematician Hel Braun in the same neighborhood; though they never married, their relationship was equivalent to marriage. On January 4, 1961, he was granted German citizenship. In June 1962, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of Blaise Pascal, the University of Clermont-Ferrand conferred an honorary doctorate on him. On December 20 of the same year, Artin died at home in Hamburg, aged 64, of a heart attack./nThe University of Hamburg honored his memory on April 26, 2005, by naming one of its newly renovated lecture halls The Emil Artin Lecture Hall.[8]/nArtin was one of the leading algebraists of the century, with an influence larger than might be guessed from the one volume of his Collected Papers edited by  Serge Lang and John Tate. He worked in algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields. The influential treatment of abstract algebra by van der Waerden is said to derive in part from Artin's ideas, as well as those of Emmy Noether. Artin solved Hilbert's seventeenth problem in 1927. He also developed the theory of braids[9] as a branch of algebraic topology./nIn 1955 Artin was teaching foundations of geometry at New York University. He used his notes to publish Geometric Algebra in 1957, where he extended the material to include symplectic geometry./nArtin was also an important expositor of Galois theory, and of the group cohomology approach to class ring theory[10] (with John Tate), to mention two theories where his formulations became standard./nHe left two conjectures, both known as Artin's conjecture. The first concerns Artin L-functions for a linear representation of a Galois group; and the second the frequency with which a given integer a is a primitive root modulo primes p, when a is fixed and p varies. These are unproven; in 1967, Hooley published a conditional proof for the second conjecture, assuming certain cases of the generalized Riemann hypothesis.[11]/nArtin advised over thirty doctoral students, including Bernard Dwork, Serge Lang, K. G. Ramanathan, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro,[12] Hans Zassenhaus and Max Zorn.  A more complete list of his students can be found at the Mathematics Genealogy Project website (see \"External links,\" below)./nIn 1932 he married Natascha Jasny, born in Russia to mixed parentage (her mother was Christian, her father, Jewish).[13] Artin was not himself Jewish, but, on account of his wife's racial status in Nazi Germany, was dismissed from his university position in 1937. They had three children, one of whom is Michael Artin, an American algebraic geometer and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His daughter, Karin Artin, was the first wife of John Tate.[14]", "48740": "Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 (UK: /\u02c8pw\u00e6\u0303k\u0251\u02d0re\u026a/, US: /\u02ccpw\u00e6\u0303k\u0251\u02d0\u02c8re\u026a/; French: [\u0251\u0303\u0281i pw\u025b\u0303ka\u0281e] \u24d8;[1][2][3] 29 April 1854\u00a0\u2013 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and philosopher of science. He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist\",[4] since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime. Due to his scientific success, influence and his discoveries, he has been deemed \"the philosopher par excellence of modern science.\"[5]/nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics.[6] In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar\u00e9 became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology./nPoincar\u00e9 made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincar\u00e9 discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations.[7] In 1912, he wrote an influential paper which provided a mathematical argument for quantum mechanics.[8][9]/nThe Poincar\u00e9 group used in physics and mathematics was named after him./nEarly in the 20th century he formulated the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture that became over time one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics until it was solved in 2002\u20132003 by Grigori Perelman./nPoincar\u00e9 was born on 29 April 1854 in Cit\u00e9 Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, into an influential French family.[10] His father L\u00e9on Poincar\u00e9 (1828\u20131892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy.[11] His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher \u00c9mile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, a fellow member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, who was President of France from 1913 to 1920, and three-time Prime Minister of France between 1913 and 1929.[12]/nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eug\u00e9nie Launois (1830\u20131897)./nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy (now renamed the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-Poincar\u00e9\u00a0[fr] in his honour, along with Henri Poincar\u00e9 University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lyc\u00e9e and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lyc\u00e9es across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\".[13] However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties.[14] He graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e in 1871 with a baccalaur\u00e9at in both letters and sciences./nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps./nPoincar\u00e9 entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (D\u00e9monstration nouvelle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the \u00c9cole des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.[15]/nAs a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way./nAt the same time, Poincar\u00e9 was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des fonctions d\u00e9finies par les \u00e9quations aux diff\u00e9rences partielles. Poincar\u00e9 devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the Solar System. Poincar\u00e9 graduated from the University of Paris in 1879./nAfter receiving his degree, Poincar\u00e9 began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions./nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d'Andecy (1857\u20131934), granddaughter of Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and great-granddaughter of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and on 20 April 1881, they married.[16] Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and L\u00e9on (born 1893)./nPoincar\u00e9 immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincar\u00e9 was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique./nIn 1881\u20131882, Poincar\u00e9 created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics./nHe never fully abandoned his career in the mining administration to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps des Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910./nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis).[17] Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability,[18] and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy./nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincar\u00e9 was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 5 March 1908./nIn 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)/nIn 1893, Poincar\u00e9 joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincar\u00e9 backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude.[19] It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)/nIn 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus, attacking the spurious scientific claims regarding evidence brought against Dreyfus./nPoincar\u00e9 was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.[20]/nPoincar\u00e9 had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).[21]/nIn 1912, Poincar\u00e9 underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincar\u00e9 family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris, in section 16 close to the gate Rue \u00c9mile-Richard./nA former French Minister of Education, Claude All\u00e8gre, proposed in 2004 that Poincar\u00e9 be reburied in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens of the highest honour.[22]/nPoincar\u00e9 made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, quantum theory, theory of relativity and physical cosmology./nHe was also a populariser of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public./nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:/nThe problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the Solar System had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:/nGiven a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly./nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincar\u00e9, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu[24] and the book by Barrow-Green[25]). The version finally printed[26] contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n\u00a0=\u00a03 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n\u00a0>\u00a03 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s. The series solutions have very slow convergence. It would take millions of terms to determine the motion of the particles for even very short intervals of time, so they are unusable in numerical work.[24]/nPoincar\u00e9's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\" \n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\u2032\n\n\n=\nt\n\u2212\nv\nx\n\n/\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t^{\\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}\\,}\n\n[27]\nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson\u2013Morley experiment).[28] Poincar\u00e9 was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincar\u00e9 as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincar\u00e9 said, \"A little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.[29]\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.[30]/nIn 1881 Poincar\u00e9 described hyperbolic geometry in terms of the hyperboloid model, formulating transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}=-1}\n\n, which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions.[31][32] In addition, Poincar\u00e9's other models of hyperbolic geometry (Poincar\u00e9 disk model, Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model) as well as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model can be related to the relativistic velocity space (see Gyrovector space)./nIn 1892 Poincar\u00e9 developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincar\u00e9 sphere.[33] It was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 sphere possesses an underlying Lorentzian symmetry, by which it can be used as a geometrical representation of Lorentz transformations and velocity additions.[34]/nHe discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900[30][35]\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.[36]\nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincar\u00e9 described as a \"paper of supreme importance\". In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.[37]\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all\u2014it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group\u2014and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.[38]\nPoincar\u00e9 later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:[39]/nThe essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:/nand showed that the arbitrary function \n\n\n\n\u2113\n\n(\n\u03b5\n)\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell \\left(\\varepsilon \\right)}\n\n must be unity for all \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }\n\n (Lorentz had set \n\n\n\n\u2113\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ell =1}\n\n by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincar\u00e9 pointed out that the combination \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\nt\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}}\n\n is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing \n\n\n\nc\nt\n\n\n\u2212\n1\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ct{\\sqrt {-1}}}\n\n as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors.[40] Poincar\u00e9 expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit.[41] So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.[citation needed]/nLike others before, Poincar\u00e9 (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included.[30] He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincar\u00e9 concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible\u2014it's neither created or destroyed\u2014then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincar\u00e9 assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincar\u00e9 said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions./nHowever, Poincar\u00e9's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincar\u00e9 performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether./nPoincar\u00e9 himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904).[36] He rejected[42] the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized his own solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:/nThe apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless./nIn the above quote he refers to the Hertz assumption of total aether entrainment that was falsified by the Fizeau experiment but that experiment does indeed show that that light is partially \"carried along\" with a substance. Finally in 1908[43] he revisits the problem and ends with abandoning the principle of reaction altogether in favor of supporting a solution based in the inertia of aether itself./nBut we have seen above that Fizeau's experiment does not permit of our retaining the theory of Hertz; it is necessary therefore to adopt the theory of Lorentz, and consequently to renounce the principle of reaction./nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass \n\n\n\n\u03b3\nm\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\gamma m}\n\n, Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Marie Curie./nIt was Albert Einstein's concept of mass\u2013energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m\u00a0=\u00a0E/c2 that resolved[44] Poincar\u00e9's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether.[45] The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincar\u00e9's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincar\u00e9's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.[46]/nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.  He wrote:/nIt has become important to examine this hypothesis more closely and in particular to ask in what ways it would require us to modify the laws of gravitation.  That is what I have tried to determine;  at first I was led to assume that the propagation of gravitation is not instantaneous, but happens with the speed of light.[47][39]/nEinstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincar\u00e9's short paper,[39] but before Poincar\u00e9's longer version.[40] Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincar\u00e9 (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincar\u00e9 never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincar\u00e9's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincar\u00e9's to be close to Vaihinger's.[48] In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincar\u00e9 posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 titled \"Geometrie und Erfahrung (Geometry and Experience)\" in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincar\u00e9 as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognized that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincar\u00e9 deepened this insight still further ....\".[49]/nPoincar\u00e9's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised,[44] though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work.[50] Poincar\u00e9 developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincar\u00e9 tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.[51][52][53][54][55]/nWhile this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.[56]/nPoincar\u00e9 introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations.[57] He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations./nThe subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincar\u00e9. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.[58]/nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincar\u00e9 proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.[59]/nPoincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincar\u00e9 showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.[60]/nThese monographs include an idea of Poincar\u00e9, which later became the basis for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincar\u00e9 authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincar\u00e9 received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).[61]/nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincar\u00e9 wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881\u20131882).[62] In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincar\u00e9 showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincar\u00e9 investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincar\u00e9 also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction \u2013 the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.[63]/nPoincar\u00e9's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincar\u00e9 was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries./nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (an intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincar\u00e9's research demonstrated marvelous clarity[64] and Poincar\u00e9 himself wrote that he  believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas./nPoincar\u00e9's mental organisation was interesting not only to Poincar\u00e9 himself but also to \u00c9douard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1910).[65][66] In it, he discussed Poincar\u00e9's regular schedule:/nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:/nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincar\u00e9 started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002)./nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:/nHabitu\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger les d\u00e9tails et \u00e0 ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une \u00e0 l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il d\u00e9couvrait se groupant d'eux-m\u00eames autour de leur centre \u00e9taient instantan\u00e9ment et automatiquement class\u00e9s dans sa m\u00e9moire (accustomed to neglecting details and to looking only at mountain tops, he went from one peak to another with surprising rapidity, and the facts he discovered, clustering around their center, were instantly and automatically pigeonholed in his memory)./nAwards/nNamed after him/nHenri Poincar\u00e9 did not receive the Nobel Prize in Physics, but he had influential advocates like Henri Becquerel or committee member G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler.[68][69] The nomination archive reveals that Poincar\u00e9 received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death.[70] Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincar\u00e9.[70] Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).[70]/nThe fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory.[71][72] In Poincar\u00e9's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.[68]/nPoincar\u00e9 had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincar\u00e9 strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 gives an interesting point of view in his 1902 book Science and Hypothesis:/nFor a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule./nPoincar\u00e9 believed that arithmetic is synthetic. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincar\u00e9 then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions[citation needed]./nHowever, Poincar\u00e9 did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincar\u00e9 believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincar\u00e9 held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\".[73] Poincar\u00e9 believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012).[74] He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincar\u00e9 thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to non-Euclidean physical geometry.[75]/nPoincar\u00e9's famous lectures before the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.[76]/nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincar\u00e9 said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance./nIt is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.[77]/nPoincar\u00e9's two stages\u2014random combinations followed by selection\u2014became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.[78]/nPopular writings on the philosophy of science:/nOn algebraic topology:/nOn celestial mechanics:/nOn the philosophy of mathematics:/nOther:/nExhaustive bibliography of English translations:/nHere is a list of theorems proved by Poincar\u00e9:", "48348780": "Juan Guti\u00e9rrez de Gualda (16th century) was a priest and mathematician known to be the author of a popular book on arithmetic./nNothing is known about his life except he was the priest of Villarejo de Fuentes, province of Cuenca.[1]/nGuti\u00e9rrez is known by his book on arithmetic which was very successful in his times: Arte breve y muy provechoso de cuenta castellana y arism\u00e9tica (Toledo 1539).[2] The book was reedited not less than five times in 16th century.[3] It consist in a short arithmetic for merchants,[4] very basic, which only contains forty pages and practically only explains the four rules and few more.[5] The book is an example of the transition from roman numerals to arabic numerals because it resolves the problems with arabics (quenta arismetica), but it gives his expression in romans (quenta castellana).[6] His success was in big part due to the fact that Juan de Yciar included it as an annex of his book on calligraphy from 1564.[5]", "22527600": "Ky Fan (\u6a0a\ud880\udec0, pinyin: F\u00e1n Q\u00ed, September 19, 1914 \u2013 March 22, 2010) was a Chinese-born American mathematician.

Ky Fan went to Jinhua with his father when he was eight years old and studied at several middle schools in Zhejiang, including the Jinhua High School (currently Jinhua No.1 Middle School), Hangzhou Zongwen High School (currently Hangzhou No.10 Middle School), and Wenzhou High School.[1] Fan obtained his secondary diploma from the Jinhua High School.[2]/nFan enrolled into Peking University Department of Mathematics in 1932, and received his B.S. degree from Peking University in 1936. Initially Fan wanted to study engineering, but eventually shifted to mathematics, largely because of the influence of his uncle Feng Zuxun (\u51af\u7956\u8340, 1880\u20131940; b. Hangzhou, d.

There is a memorial to him at St Cuthbert's at the west side of Edinburgh.[2]/nNapier's father was Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston Castle, and his mother was Janet Bothwell, daughter of the politician and judge Francis Bothwell,[3] and a sister of Adam Bothwell who became the Bishop of Orkney. Archibald Napier was 16 years old when John Napier was born.[3]/nThere are no records of Napier's early education, but many believe that he was privately tutored during early childhood. At age 13, he was enrolled in St Salvator's College, St Andrews. Near the time of his matriculation the quality of the education provided by the university was poor, owing in part to the Reformation's causing strife between those of the old faith and the growing numbers of Protestants. There are no records showing that John Napier completed his education at St Andrews.[4] It is believed he left Scotland to further his education in mainland Europe, following the advice given by his uncle Adam Bothwell in a letter written to John Napier's father on 5 December 1560, saying, \"I pray you, sir, to send John to the schools either to France or Flanders, for he can learn no good at home\".[5] It is not known which university Napier attended in Europe, but when he returned to Scotland in 1571 he was fluent in Greek, a language that was not commonly taught in European universities at the time. There are also no records showing his enrollment in the premier universities in Paris or Geneva during this time.[6][4]/nIn 1571, Napier, aged 21, returned to Scotland, and bought a castle at Gartness in 1574. On the death of his father in 1608, Napier and his family moved into Merchiston Castle in Edinburgh, where he resided the remainder of his life. He had a property within Edinburgh city as well on Borthwick's Close off the Royal Mile.[7]/nOn 7 June 1596 Napier wrote a paper Secret inventions, profitable and necessary in these days for defence of this island. He describes two kinds of burning mirror for use against ships at a distance, a special kind of artillery shot, and a musket-proof metal chariot.[8]/nNapier died from the effects of gout at home at Merchiston Castle at the age of 67. He was buried in the kirkyard of St Giles in Edinburgh. Following the loss of the kirkyard of St Giles to build Parliament House, his remains were transferred to an underground vault on the north side of St Cuthbert's Parish Church at the west side of Edinburgh.[2] There is also a wall monument to Napier at St Cuthbert's.[2]/nMany mathematicians at the time were acutely aware of the issues of computation and were dedicated to relieving practitioners of the calculation burden. Napier was famous for his devices to assist with these issues of computation. He invented a well-known mathematical artefact, the ingenious numbering rods more quaintly known as \"Napier's bones\",[9] that offered mechanical means for facilitating computation./nIn addition, Napier recognized the potential of the recent developments in mathematics, particularly those of prosthaphaeresis, decimal fractions, and symbolic index arithmetic, to tackle the issue of reducing computation. He appreciated that, for the most part, practitioners who had laborious computations generally did them in the context of trigonometry. Therefore, as well as developing the logarithmic relation, Napier set it in a trigonometric context so it would be even more relevant./nHis work Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (1614) contained fifty-seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables listing the natural logarithms of trigonometric functions.[10]:\u200aCh. III\u200a The book also has a discussion of theorems in spherical trigonometry, usually known as Napier's Rules of Circular Parts./nModern English translations of both Napier's books on logarithms and their description can be found on the web, as well as a discussion of Napier's bones and Promptuary (another early calculating device).[11]/nHis invention of logarithms was quickly taken up at Gresham College, and prominent English mathematician Henry Briggs visited Napier in 1615. Among the matters they discussed were a re-scaling of Napier's logarithms, in which the presence of the mathematical constant now known as e (more accurately, e times a large power of 10 rounded to an integer) was a practical difficulty. Neither Napier nor Briggs actually discovered the constant e; that discovery was made decades later by Jacob Bernoulli./nNapier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table. The computational advance available via logarithms, the inverse of powered numbers or exponential notation, was such that it made calculations by hand much quicker.[12] The way was opened to later scientific advances, in astronomy, dynamics, and other areas of physics./nNapier made further contributions. He improved Simon Stevin's decimal notation, introducing the period (.) as the delimiter for the fractional part.[13]:\u200ap. 8,\u200aarchive p. 32)\u200a Lattice multiplication, used by Fibonacci, was made more convenient by his introduction of Napier's bones, a multiplication tool using a set of numbered rods./nNapier may have worked largely in isolation, but he had contact with Tycho Brahe who corresponded with his friend John Craig. Craig certainly announced the discovery of logarithms to Brahe in the 1590s (the name itself came later); there is a story from Anthony \u00e0 Wood, perhaps not well substantiated, that Napier had a hint from Craig that Longomontanus, a follower of Brahe, was working in a similar direction./nIt has been shown[by whom?][weasel\u00a0words] that Craig had notes on a method of Paul Wittich that used trigonometric identities to reduce a multiplication formula for the sine function to additions.[14]/nWhen one of the angles, say C, of a spherical triangle is equal to \u03c0/2 the various identities given above are considerably simplified. There are ten identities relating three elements chosen from the set a, b, c, A, B./nNapier[15] provided an elegant mnemonic aid for the ten independent equations: the mnemonic is called Napier's circle or Napier's pentagon (when the circle in the above figure, right, is replaced by a pentagon)./nFirst, write the six parts of the triangle (three vertex angles, three arc angles for the sides) in the order they occur around any circuit of the triangle: for the triangle shown above left, going clockwise starting with  a  gives aCbAcB. Next replace the parts that are not adjacent to C (that is A, c, B) by their complements and then delete the angle C from the list. The remaining parts can then be drawn as five ordered, equal slices of a pentagram, or circle, as shown in the above figure (right). For any choice of three contiguous parts, one (the middle part) will be adjacent to two parts and opposite the other two parts. The ten Napier's Rules are given by/nThe key for remembering which trigonometric function goes with which part is to look at the first vowel of the kind of part: middle parts take the sine, adjacent parts take the tangent, and opposite parts take the cosine.

Under the influence of the sermons of Christopher Goodman, he developed a strongly anti-papal reading, going as far as to say that the Pope was the Antichrist in some of his writings.[12][17]/nNapier regarded A Plaine Discovery of the Whole Revelation of St. John (1593) as his most important work. It was written in English, unlike his other publications, in order to reach the widest audience and so that, according to Napier, \"the simple of this island may be instructed\".[17] A Plaine Discovery used mathematical analysis of the Book of Revelation to attempt to predict the date of the Apocalypse. Napier identified events in chronological order which he believed were parallels to events described in the Book of Revelation believing that Revelation's structure implied that the prophecies would be fulfilled incrementally.[17] In this work Napier dated the seventh trumpet to 1541, and predicted the end of the world would occur in either 1688 or 1700. Napier did not believe that people could know the true date of the Apocalypse, but claimed that since the Bible contained so many clues about the end, God wanted the Church to know when the end was coming.[17]/nIn his dedication of the Plaine Discovery to James VI, dated 29 Jan 1594,[18] Napier urged the king to see \"that justice be done against the enemies of God's church,\" and counselled the King \"to reform the universal enormities of his country, and first to begin at his own house, family, and court.\" The volume includes nine pages of Napier's English verse. It met with success at home and abroad. In 1600 Michiel Panneel produced a Dutch translation, and this reached a second edition in 1607. In 1602 the work appeared at La Rochelle in a French version, by Georges Thomson, revised by Napier, and that also went through several editions (1603, 1605, and 1607). A new edition of the English original was called for in 1611, when it was revised and corrected by the author, and enlarged by the addition of With a resolution of certain doubts, moved by some well affected brethren.;[19] this appeared simultaneously at Edinburgh and London. The author stated that he still intended to publish a Latin edition, but it never appeared. A German translation, by Leo de Dromna, of the first part of Napier's work appeared at Gera in 1611, and of the whole by Wolfgang Meyer at Frankfurt-am-Main, in 1615.[12] Among Napier's followers was Matthew Cotterius (Matthieu Cotti\u00e8re).[20]/nIn addition to his mathematical and religious interests, Napier was often perceived as a magician, and is thought to have dabbled in alchemy and necromancy. It was said that he would travel about with a black spider in a small box, and that his black rooster was his familiar spirit.[21][22][23]/nSome of Napier's neighbors accused him of being a sorcerer and in league with the devil, believing that all of the time he spent in his study was being used to learn the black art. These rumors were stoked when Napier used his black rooster to catch a thief. Napier told his servants to go into a darkened room and pet the rooster, claiming the bird would crow if they were the one who stole his property. Unbeknownst to the servants, Napier had covered the rooster with soot. When the servants emerged from the room, Napier inspected their hands to find the one who had been too afraid to touch the rooster.[24]/nAnother act which Napier is reported to have done, which may have seemed mystical to the locals, was when Napier removed the pigeons from his estate, since they were eating his grain. Napier caught the pigeons by strewing grain laced with alcohol throughout the field, and then capturing the pigeons once they were too drunk to fly away.[25]/nA contract still exists for a treasure hunt, made between Napier and Robert Logan of Restalrig. Napier was to search Fast Castle for treasure allegedly hidden there, wherein it is stated that Napier should \"do his utmost diligence to search and seek out, and by all craft and ingine to find out the same, or make it sure that no such thing has been there.\"[12][26] This contract was never fulfilled by Napier, and no gold was found when the Edinburgh Archaeological Field society excavated the castle between 1971 and 1986.[26]/nAmong Napier's early followers were the instrument makers Edmund Gunter and John Speidell.[27][28][29] The development of logarithms is given credit as the largest single factor in the general adoption of decimal arithmetic.[30] The Trissotetras (1645) of Thomas Urquhart builds on Napier's work, in trigonometry.[31]/nHenry Briggs was an early adopter of the Napierian logarithm. He later computed a new table of logarithms to base 10, accurate to 14 decimal places.[32]/nAn alternative unit to the decibel used in electrical engineering, the neper, is named after Napier, as is Edinburgh Napier University in Edinburgh, Scotland./nThe crater Neper on the Moon is named after him.[33]/nIn French, Spanish and Portuguese, the natural logarithm is named after him (respectively, Logarithme N\u00e9p\u00e9rien and Logaritmos Neperianos for Spanish and Portuguese).  In Finnish and Italian, the mathematical constant e is named after him (Neperin luku and Numero di Nepero)./nIn 1572, Napier married 16-year-old Elizabeth, daughter of James Stirling, the 4th Laird of Keir and of Cadder.[34] They had two children. Elizabeth died in 1579, and Napier then married Agnes Chisholm, with whom he had ten more children./nNapier's father-in-law, Sir James Chisholm of Cromlix, was one of many excommunicated by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian party following the Spanish blanks plot. Napier sat on the General Assembly that excommunicated the plotters, and petitioned the King James VI and I to enforce the punishment on the plotters, but was ultimately ignored since the King believed the ministers were acting cruelly, and was in favor of pursuing policies of more appeasement.[17][35]/nHis half-brother (through his father's remarriage) was Alexander Napier, Lord Laurieston./nAttributio", "60145273": "Frederick Purser (1839\u201330 January 1910) was an Irish mathematician, author, and member of the Royal Irish Academy.

The book was republished by Dover Publications in 1996.[7] Similarly, Theoretical Aerodynamics, first published in 1948, went through a number of editions with the fourth appearing in 1968.", "7716518": "Richard David Gill (born 1951[1]) is a British-Dutch mathematician. He has held academic positions in the Netherlands. As a probability theorist and statistician, Gill has researched counting processes. He is also known for his consulting and advocacy on behalf of alleged victims of statistical misrepresentation, including the reversal of the murder conviction of a Dutch nurse who had been jailed for six years./nGill studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge (1970\u20131973), and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there (1973\u20131974).[1] He obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1979,[2] with the thesis Censoring and Stochastic Integrals,[1] which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff  of the Vrije Universiteit, which awarded the doctorate.[3]/nGill has said that he was \"not much of an activist\" as a student, but now feels guilty about not speaking up more at the time about perceived injustices, saying that this is partly because of an incident when working as a statistician in the 1970s when he helped on an experiment that severed the front legs of rats to investigate whether it would lead to the reshaping of their skulls. Gill said that this incident has stayed with him, as \"what upset me most is that I didn\u2019t have the strength of character to refuse to do that job\".[4]/nIn 1974[5] Gill was appointed at the Mathematical Centre (later renamed Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, or CWI) of Amsterdam.[6] After receiving his Ph.D., he continued to collaborate with Danish and Norwegian statisticians for ten years, co-authoring Statistical models based on counting processes, by Andersen, Borgan, Gill, and Keiding.[7]/nGill became head of the Department of Mathematical Statistics at CWI in 1983.[8] In 1988, Gill moved to the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University,[8] where he held the chair in mathematical stochastics. His PhD students include Sara van de Geer,[3] and Mark van der Laan (co-advised by Peter Bickel).[9] In 2006, Gill moved to the Department of Mathematics at Leiden University, where he held the chair of mathematical statistics.[5] He retired from Leiden in 2017.[10]/nGill became a citizen of the Netherlands in 1996.[1]/nGill has lobbied for retrials for nurses whose criminal convictions were based in part on statistical evidence, including Lucia de Berk and Benjamin Geen.[4] Gill also said in a 2021 lecture that he suspects Beverley Allitt is innocent, and in a 2020 paper said the case \"deserves fresh study\".[11][12] Gill states that his original involvement in campaigning for nurses stemmed from his wife encouraging him to get involved in the de Berk case, recounting her saying \"They\u2019re using statistics; you should get involved, do something useful\".[4]/nDe Berk was sentenced in the Netherlands to life imprisonment in 2003, after a legal psychologist gave testimony that there was great likelihood that de Berk committed a string of murders.[13] Gill and other professional statisticians showed this statistical testimony to be fallacious.[13] Continued scrutiny further invalidated the testimony by showing that the data had been collected to support the conviction of de Berk.[14][15][16] After a campaign in which Gill helped, a retrial was ordered and de Berk was found not guilty; she received a public apology from the Dutch government, which also began negotiating financial compensation.[17][18]/nGill's challenge of statistical evidence played a role in securing Daniela Poggiali's acquittal on murder charges in Italy in 2021.[4][19]/nBenjamin Geen's applications for a retrial have been rejected.[4][20] In rejecting Geen's 2009 appeal, the Court of Appeal observed that the evidence against Geen was overwhelming, and concluded that approaching the case on the basis of academic statistical opinion was divorced from the actual facts.[21][22] Subsequent appeals by Geen to the Criminal Cases Review Commission failed in 2013 and 2015, with the CCRC likewise agreeing that compelling evidence existed other than statistics to indicate his guilt\u00a0\u2013 such as the fact that he was found on arrest to suspiciously have a syringe full of a muscle relaxant drug in his pocket and also that the patients specifically declined when he was in charge of caring for them.[21][20]/nIn 2022 Gill contributed to a peer reviewed report from the Royal Statistical Society on statistical issues in investigation of suspected medical misconduct.[23][24]/nSince the murder conviction of Lucy Letby in August 2023, Gill has questioned the statistical and scientific evidence in her case, stating, on his personal website: \"As a scientist, I am saying that this case is a major miscarriage of justice. Lucy did not have a fair trial. The similarities with the famous case of Lucia de Berk in the Netherlands are deeply disturbing.\"[25][26] Gill was warned by British police during Letby's trial that his attempts to discredit the case against her whilst proceedings were ongoing constituted a \"blatant and serious contempt of court\", and he was visited in the Netherlands and instructed to stop and remove his online content. Gill was told in July 2023 that he risked arrest were he to return to the UK. Letby's defence team had rejected the help of Gill for the trial.[27]/nGill is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[28] He is a past president of the Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research.[29] Gill was selected as the 2010\u20132011 Distinguished Lorentz Fellow by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences.[30][31]", "7913127": "Zvi Galil (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05dc; born June 26, 1947) is an Israeli-American computer scientist and mathematician.

Storey Chair in Computing and Executive Advisor to Online Programs at Georgia Tech./nIn 1982, Galil founded the Columbia University Theory Day and organized the event for the first 15 years. It still exists as the New York Area Theory Day.[23] From 1983 to 1987, Galil served as the chairman of ACM SIGACT, an organization that promotes research in theoretical computer science.[24] He served as managing editor of SIAM Journal on Computing from 1991 to 1997 and editor in chief of Journal of Algorithms from 1988 to 2003./nGalil's research is in the areas of algorithms (particularly string and graph algorithms) complexity, and cryptography. He has also conducted research in experimental design with Jack Kiefer./nGalil's real-time algorithms are the fastest possible for string matching and palindrome recognition, and they work even on the most basic computer model, the multi-tape Turing machine. More generally, he formulated a \"predictability\" condition that allows any complying online algorithm to be converted to a real-time algorithm.[25][26] With Joel Seiferas, Galil improved the time-optimal algorithms to be space optimal (logarithmic space) as well.[27]/nGalil worked with Dany Breslauer to design a linear-work, O(loglogn) parallel algorithm for string matching,[28] and they later proved it to have the best possible time complexity among linear work algorithms.[29] With other computer scientists, he designed a constant-time linear-work randomized search algorithm to be used when the pattern preprocessing is given.[30]/nWith his students, Galil designed more than a dozen currently-fastest algorithms for exact or approximate, sequential or parallel, and one- or multi-dimensional string matching./nGalil worked with other computer scientists to develop several currently-fastest graph algorithms. Examples include: maximum weighted matching;[31] trivalent graph isomorphism;[32] and minimum weight spanning trees.[33]/nWith his students, Galil devised a technique he called \"sparsification\"[34] and a method he called \"sparse dynamic programming\".[35] The first was used to speed up dynamic graph algorithms. The second was used to speed up the computations of various edit distances between strings./nIn 1979, together with Ofer Gabber, Galil solved the previously open problem of constructing a family of expander graphs with an explicit expansion ratio,[36] useful in the design of fast graph algorithms./nIn 1995, Galil was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery for \"fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of algorithms and outstanding service to the theoretical computer science community,\"[37] and in 2004, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for \"contributions to the design and analysis of algorithms and for leadership in computer science and engineering.\"[38][39] In 2005, he was selected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[40] In 2008, Columbia University established the Zvi Galil award for student life.[41] In 2009, the Columbia Society of Graduates awarded him the Great Teacher Award.[42] In 2012, The University of Waterloo awarded Galil with an honorary Doctor of Mathematics degree for his \"fundamental contributions in the areas of graph algorithms and string matching.\"[43] In 2020, Academic Influence included Galil in the list of the 10 most influential computer scientists of the last decade, and the advisory board of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech raised over $2 million from over 130 donors to establish an endowed chair named after Galil.[44][45]", "6864552": "Edward Rowe Mores, FSA (/\u02c8m\u0252r\u026as/; 24 January 1731 [OS: 13 January 1730] \u2013 22 November 1778) was an English antiquarian and scholar, who wrote works on history and typography.

His father Edward Mores (1681\u20131740) was a member of the gentry, and had been rector of Tunstall for twenty years. His mother was Sarah Windsor, the daughter of a City merchant. He had one sister, Ann-Catherine./nIn 1740, Mores's father died leaving a considerable inheritance, and later the same year he entered the Merchant Taylors' School in London. His mother soon remarried, to Richard Bridgman, a grocer of Whitechapel, London, who was of increasing importance in the Grocers' Company. Mores entered Queen's College, Oxford in 1746, obtaining a BA in 1750, and MA in 1753./nAt Oxford, he was renowned for the range and depth of his learning and for his idiosyncrasies. He studied Latin, and spoke it almost exclusively to his daughter when she was young. Besides mathematics, he was interested in such diverse studies as heraldry and architecture. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1752, and the following year was elected a member of the society's council.[1]/nHe published his first work, Nomina et insignia gentilitia nobilium equitumque sub Edoardo primo rege militantium (a study of the heraldry of the knights of Edward I), in 1749, at the age of 19 and when he was still at Oxford. He spent some years working on a projected county history of Berkshire: it remained unfinished, but the manuscript was eventually published posthumously in 1783 by Richard Gough as Collections toward a Parochial History of Berkshire. In 1754\u201355 he assisted his friend Andrew Ducarel (who had limited eyesight) in compiling a manuscript history of Croydon Palace and the town of Croydon for presentation to Thomas Herring, Archbishop of Canterbury: however, the work led to a virulent rift between the two when Mores discovered that he was not given due credit on the title page. This work was eventually also published in 1783.[1][2]/nAfter James Dodson's death, Mores became the leader of the group which eventually became the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship in 1762. He specified that the chief official should be called the actuary, which is the earliest known reference to the position as a business concern.[3]/nMores married Susannah Bridgman (1730\u20131767) in 1753. She was the daughter of Richard Bridgman, Mores's stepfather. The couple had two children: a daughter, Sarah, who predeceased her father; and a son, Edward Rowe (d. 1846). Mores, who believed firmly in the superiority of Latin, spoke exclusively in Latin to his children.[1]/nMores died on 28 November 1778 at Etlow House, Low Leyton, Essex, of a \"mortification\" of the leg (i.e. gangrene).

He helped found the modern British school of pure mathematics./nAs a child, Cayley enjoyed solving complex maths problems for amusement. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he excelled in Greek, French, German, and Italian, as well as mathematics.  He worked as a lawyer for 14 years./nHe postulated what is now known as the Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem\u2014that every square matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial, and verified it for matrices of order 2 and 3.[1] He was the first to define the concept of a group in the modern way\u2014as a set with a binary operation satisfying certain laws.[2] Formerly, when mathematicians spoke of \"groups\", they had meant permutation groups. Cayley tables and Cayley graphs as well as Cayley's theorem are named in honour of Cayley./nArthur Cayley was born in Richmond, London, England, on 16 August 1821. His father, Henry Cayley, was a distant cousin of Sir George Cayley, the aeronautics engineer innovator, and descended from an ancient Yorkshire family. He settled in Saint Petersburg, Russia, as a merchant. His mother was Maria Antonia Doughty, daughter of William Doughty. According to some writers she was Russian, but her father's name indicates an English origin. His brother was the linguist Charles Bagot Cayley. Arthur spent his first eight years in Saint Petersburg. In 1829 his parents were settled permanently at Blackheath, near London. Arthur was sent to a private school. At age 14 he was sent to King's College School. The school's master observed indications of mathematical genius and advised the father to educate his son not for his own business, as he had intended, but at the University of Cambridge./nAt the unusually early age of 17 Cayley began residence at Trinity College, Cambridge. The cause of the Analytical Society had now triumphed, and the Cambridge Mathematical Journal had been instituted by Gregory and Robert Leslie Ellis. To this journal, at the age of twenty, Cayley contributed three papers, on subjects that had been suggested by reading the M\u00e9canique analytique of Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace./nCayley's tutor at Cambridge was George Peacock and his private coach was William Hopkins. He finished his undergraduate course by winning the place of Senior Wrangler, and the first Smith's prize.[3] His next step was to take the M.A. degree, and win a Fellowship by competitive examination. He continued to reside at Cambridge University for four years; during which time he took some pupils, but his main work was the preparation of 28 memoirs to the  Mathematical Journal./nBecause of the limited tenure of his fellowship it was necessary to choose a profession; like De Morgan, Cayley chose law, and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn, London on 20 April 1846 at the age of 24.[4] He made a specialty of conveyancing. It was while he was a pupil at the bar examination that he went to Dublin to hear Hamilton's lectures on quaternions.[5]/nHis friend J. J. Sylvester, his senior by five years at Cambridge, was then an actuary, resident in London; they used to walk together round the courts of Lincoln's Inn, discussing the theory of invariants and covariants. During this period of his life, extending over fourteen years, Cayley produced between two and three hundred papers.[5]/nAt Cambridge University the ancient professorship of pure mathematics is denominated as the Lucasian, and is the chair that had been occupied by Isaac Newton. Around 1860, certain funds bequeathed by Lady Sadleir to the university, having become useless for their original purpose, were employed to establish another professorship of pure mathematics, called the Sadleirian. The duties of the new professor were defined to be \"to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics and to apply himself to the advancement of that science.\" To this chair Cayley was elected when 42 years old. He gave up a lucrative practice for a modest salary; but he never regretted the exchange, for the chair at Cambridge enabled him to end the divided allegiance between law and mathematics, and to devote his energies to the pursuit that he liked best. He at once married and settled down in Cambridge. More fortunate than Hamilton in his choice, he enjoyed a home life of great happiness. His friend and fellow investigator, Sylvester, once remarked that Cayley had been much more fortunate than himself; that they had both lived as bachelors in London, but that Cayley had married and settled down to a quiet and peaceful life at Cambridge; whereas he had never married, and had been fighting the world all his days./nAt first the teaching duty of the Sadleirian professorship was limited to a course of lectures extending over one of the terms of the academic year; but when the university was reformed about 1886, and part of the college funds applied to the better endowment of the university professors, the lectures were extended over two terms. For many years the attendance was small, and came almost entirely from those who had finished their career of preparation for competitive examinations; after the reform the attendance numbered about fifteen. The subject lectured on was generally that of the memoir on which the professor was for the time engaged./nThe other duty of the chair \u2014 the advancement of mathematical science \u2014 was discharged in a handsome manner by the long series of memoirs that he published, ranging over every department of pure mathematics. But it was also discharged in a much less obtrusive way; he became the standing referee on the merits of mathematical papers to many societies both at home and abroad./nIn 1872 he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, and three years later an ordinary fellow, which meant stipend as well as honour. About this time his friends subscribed for a presentation portrait. Maxwell wrote an address to the committee of subscribers who had charge of the Cayley portrait fund. The verses refer to the subjects investigated in several of Cayley's most elaborate memoirs; such as, Chapters on the Analytical Geometry of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n dimensions; On the theory of Determinants; Memoir on the theory of Matrices; Memoirs on skew surfaces, otherwise Scrolls; On the delineation of a Cubic Scroll, etc.[6]/nIn addition to his work on algebra, Cayley made fundamental contributions to algebraic geometry. Cayley and Salmon discovered the 27 lines on a cubic surface. Cayley constructed the Chow variety of all curves in projective 3-space.[7] He founded the algebro-geometric theory of ruled surfaces./nIn 1876 he published a Treatise on Elliptic Functions. He took great interest in the movement for the university education of women. At Cambridge the women's colleges are Girton and Newnham. In the early days of Girton College he gave direct help in teaching, and for some years he was chairman of the council of Newnham College, in the progress of which he took the keenest interest to the last./nIn 1881 he received from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, where Sylvester was then professor of mathematics, an invitation\nto deliver a course of lectures. He accepted the invitation, and lectured at Baltimore during the first five months of 1882 on the\nsubject of the Abelian and Theta Functions./nIn 1893 Cayley became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.[8]/nIn 1883 Cayley was President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The meeting was held at Southport, in the north of England. As the President's address is one of the great popular events of the meeting, and brings out an audience of general culture, it is usually made as little technical as possible. Cayley (1996)  took for his subject the Progress of Pure Mathematics./nIn 1889 the Cambridge University Press requested him to prepare his mathematical papers for publication in a collected form\u2014a request which he appreciated very much. They are printed in quarto volumes, of which seven appeared under his own editorship. While editing these volumes, he was suffering from a painful internal malady, to which he succumbed on 26 January 1895, in the 74th year of his age. When the funeral took place, a great assemblage met in Trinity Chapel, comprising members of the university, official representatives of Russia and America, and many of the most illustrious philosophers of Britain./nThe remainder of his papers were edited by Andrew Forsyth, his successor in the Sadleirian Chair. The Collected Mathematical papers number thirteen quarto volumes, and contain 967 papers.  Cayley retained to the last his fondness for novel-reading and for travelling. He also took special pleasure in paintings and architecture, and he practiced water-colour painting, which he found useful sometimes in making mathematical diagrams./nCayley is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge./nAn 1874 portrait of Cayley by Lowes Cato Dickinson and an 1884 portrait by William Longmaid are in the collection of Trinity College, Cambridge.[9]/nA number of mathematical terms are named after him:/nThis article incorporates text from the 1916 Lectures on Ten British Mathematicians of the Nineteenth Century by Alexander Macfarlane, which is in the public domain.", "13123327": "Trevor Pearcey (5 March 1919 \u2013 27 January 1998) was a British-born Australian scientist, who created CSIRAC, one of the first stored-program electronic computers in the world./nBorn in Woolwich, London, he graduated from Imperial College in 1940 with first class honours in physics and mathematics.

She was a champion of the controversial 'cyclol' hypothesis for the structure of proteins./nDorothy Wrinch was born in Rosario, Argentina, the daughter of Hugh Edward Hart Wrinch, an engineer, and Ada Souter. The family returned to England and Dorothy grew up in Surbiton, near London. She attended Surbiton High School and in 1913 entered Girton College, Cambridge to read mathematics. Wrinch often attended meetings of the Heretics Club run by Charles Kay Ogden, and it was through a 1914 lecture organised by Ogden that she first heard Bertrand Russell speak.[1] She graduated in 1916 as a wrangler.[2]/nFor the academic year 1916\u20131917, Wrinch took the Cambridge Moral Sciences tripos and studied mathematical logic with Russell in London. In December she was invited to Garsington Manor, the home of Russell's then mistress Ottoline Morell, and there encountered Clive Bell and other Bloomsbury Group members, and in 1917 she introduced Russell to Dora Black who would later become his second wife.  From 1917 Wrinch was funded by Girton College as a research student, officially supervised by G.H. Hardy in Cambridge but in practice by Russell in London.[1] When, in May 1918, Russell was imprisoned for his anti-war activities, Wrinch assisted with his writing projects by bringing him books and articles.[1] Wrinch also secured the first publication of Ludwig Wittgenstein's (not yet so named) Tractatus in a German philosophical journal in 1921.[1]/nIn London Wrinch attended the Aristotelian Society, including a debate between D'Arcy Thompson and John Scott Haldane on the nature of physics, biology and psychology, and she became a friend of Thompson. Wrinch spoke to the Society herself on the 'summation of pleasures', and through the Society she encountered Harold Jeffreys and Raphael Demos. In the autumn of 1918 Wrinch registered for graduate study on asymptotic expansions with the applied mathematician John Nicholson at King's College London, started to teach at University College, and continued to work with Jeffreys on the philosophy of scientific method. She moved into a flat in Mecklenburgh Square owned by Russell's then mistress Colette O'Neil. In 1920 Girton awarded Wrinch a four-year Yarrow Research Fellowship with the freedom to work on any area of her choice. In 1920 she was awarded an MSc and in 1921 a DSc by the University of London. Wrinch moved to Oxford in 1922 upon her marriage, where she held a succession of research fellowships and lectureships or tutorships at the Oxford women's colleges for the next 16 years.[1][2] She was Lady Carlisle Research Fellow at Somerville College, Oxford and first female Lecturer in Mathematics at the University. In 1929 she was the first woman to receive an Oxford DSc.[2]/nWrinch's first paper was a 1917 defence of Russell's philosophy,[1] and between 1918 and 1932 she published 20 papers on pure and applied mathematics and 16 on scientific methodology and on the philosophy of science. At the 1928 International Congress of Mathematics in Bologna she delivered the paper \"On a method for constructing harmonics for surfaces of revolution.\"  She also presented on \"Harmonics Associated with Certain Inverted Spheroids\" at the 1932 ICM in Z\u00fcrich.\"[3] The papers she wrote with Harold Jeffreys on scientific method formed the basis of his 1931 book Scientific Inference. In the Nature obituary Jeffreys wrote, \"I should like to put on record my appreciation of the substantial contribution she made to [our joint] work, which is the basis of all my later work on scientific inference.\"[4]/nFrom about 1932 Wrinch shifted towards theoretical biology. She was one of founders of the Biotheoretical Gathering (aka the 'Theoretical Biology Club'), an inter-disciplinary group that sought to explain life by discovering how proteins work. Also involved were Joseph Henry Woodger, Joseph and Dorothy Needham, C. H. Waddington, J. D. Bernal, Karl Popper and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.[5] From then on Wrinch could be described as a theoretical biologist. She developed a model of protein structure, which she called the \"cyclol\" structure. The model generated considerable controversy and was attacked by the chemist Linus Pauling. In these debates Wrinch's lack of training in chemistry was a great weakness. By 1939, evidence had accumulated that the model was wrong but Wrinch continued working on it.  However, experimental work by Irving Langmuir done in collaboration with Wrinch to validate her ideas catalysed the principle of the Hydrophobic effect being the driving force for protein folding.[6]/nIn 1936 Ida Busbridge secured a position as assistant to Wrinch from whom she took over mathematics tutorials for all five women\u2019s colleges.[7]/nIn 1939 Wrinch moved to the United States.[8] She had a variety of teaching positions at three small Massachusetts colleges, Amherst College, Smith College, and Mount Holyoke College. From 1942 until she retired in 1971 Wrinch held research positions at Smith./nPrior to 1918 Wrinch's Cambridge tutor GN Watson had proposed to her but the feeling was not mutual and she had to ask her father to explain this to Watson; nevertheless Watson later recommended Wrinch as his replacement lecturer at University College London.  Around the postwar time of her intellectual closeness to Russell, Wrinch may have had a romantic connection with his brother Frank and probably did have an unhappy attachment with another of his disciples, Raphael Demos. Sources differ on whether Wrinch wanted a romantic relationship with Russell.[1][9] She was for some years a close intellectual companion of Harold Jeffreys, and some contemporary observers thought them engaged. It may have been the breaking of their engagement that encouraged Jeffreys to enter psychoanalysis,[1] which was at the time fashionable in Cambridge.[10]/nIn 1922 Wrinch married her graduate supervisor at King's College London, the mathematical physicist John William Nicholson. The examination for her DSc in 1921 had, unusually, an additional referee, which may have been because of perceptions of a relationship between the two of them. Nicholson was a graduate of Owens College Manchester and also a Cambridge Wrangler. In 1921 he was elected into a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford. The couple had one child, Pamela, born in 1927. Wrinch's book on parenthood, Retreat from Parenthood (1930) published under the pseudonym Jean Ayling and dedicated to Russell, was a venture into public health rather than a manual of child-care, propounding ideas of societal reorganisation to make child rearing more compatible with professional life. Nicholson's mental health deteriorated in the late 1920s, and in 1930 he was certified as mentally ill and confined in the Warneford Hospital until his death in 1955. In 1937 Wrinch was granted a divorce on grounds of her husband's insanity.[2] From 1930 Wrinch was close emotionally and intellectually to the mathematician Eric Neville in a friendship which lasted until 1961./nIn 1939 Wrinch and her daughter moved to the United States, partly because the chancellor of Oxford University and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax advised her she would be most useful to the war effort by research and lecturing there.[1] In 1941 she married Otto Charles Glaser, chairman of the biology department and vice-president of Amherst College, and it was in part through him that she was able to obtain teaching positions. In 1944 Glaser was forced to resign as chairman because he had allowed his research assistant to spend time working for Wrinch. Glaser retired in 1948 and died in 1951.[1]/nWrinch died in Falmouth, Massachusetts on 11 February 1976./nCrowfoot Hodgkin wrote in Wrinch's obituary that she was \"a brilliant and controversial figure who played a part in the beginnings of much of present research in molecular biology.\"[11] On a more personal level, Crowfoot Hodgkin wrote, \"I like to think of her as she was when I first knew her, gay, enthusiastic and adventurous, courageous in face of much misfortune and very kind.\"[12]/nWrinch's book first summarizes the impact of having children on women\u2019s  careers, which often included termination for professional women, and the psychological and physical impact on parents and children caused by leaving to most parents practically all functions necessary to raise a child. Of special concern to her was the fact that parents generally lack the necessary expertise in practical matters like the suitable diet and social environment best-suited for a child's development, since their professional expertise is often in other areas, and that scientifically understanding these matters requires a great deal of a parent's time (away from their career)./nThe book next offers a constructive solution to this problem. Wrinch proposed that there should be Child Rearing Services that assume from parents nearly every aspect of raising the child, except in four areas where a parent's involvement is absolutely crucial: \"impregnation,\" \"gestation,\" \"childbirth,\" and \"lactation.\" The Child Rearing Services (C.R.S.) would be divided into four bureaus, A, B, C, and D. The C.R.S.A. would deal with refitting homes so as to make them more comfortable and hospitable to child rearing, providing services like electrical work, plumbing services and repairs, insulation and soundproofing, and reliable hot water. The C.R.S.B. the labor of child rearing like changing diapers, preparing meals, laundry, cleaning dishes, and so on. The C.R.S.C. would deal with food safety, inspection, diet, and delivery, with a focus on ensuring that each child was well-nourished and given the best possible diet. The C.R.S.D. would deal with all medical, nursing, psychological, and other services necessary for the health and well-being of parents and child, from pregnancy to the school door.[1]", "50020105": "Lars H\u00e5kan Eliasson (born 13 July 1952)[1] is a Swedish mathematician./nEliasson received in 1984 his PhD from the University of Stockholm under J\u00fcrgen Moser with thesis Hamiltonian systems with Poisson commuting integrals.[2] He was a professor at the \nRoyal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and then became a professor at the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot) and the Institut de math\u00e9matiques de Jussieu of the Universities Paris VI and VII and the CNRS./nHis research deals with dynamical systems, quasiperiodic motion, the problem of small denominators in perturbation theory, the KAM Theory and multiscale analysis in perturbation theory, Hamiltonian partial differential equations, and localization and diffusion in quasiperiodic Schr\u00f6dinger operators./nIn 1998 he was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.[3] In 2005 and in 2012 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study.[4]/nIn 1990 he received the Wallenberg Prize from the Swedish Mathematical Society, 1995 he received the Salem Prize, 2007 he received the Eva & Lars G\u00e5rding Prize in Mathematics and 2008 he received the Sophie Germain Prize./nHe was at the editorial committee of Acta Mathematica 2012\u20132017.", "52084493": "Alfred Inselberg (22 October 1936, Athens, Greece \u2013 30 December 2019, Tel Aviv, Israel)[1] was an American-Israeli mathematician and computer scientist based at Tel Aviv University./nInselberg started his career at the Biological Computer Laboratory based at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[2] He was part of a cybernetics group working on biomathematics developing mathematical models of the ear, neural networks, and computer models for vision and non-linear analysis, gaining a PhD [2] in mathematics and physics.

Morley worked in book publishing in London and New York and played a significant role in the early history of the publishing firm Faber and Faber, where he became a close friend of the poet T. S. Eliot./nMorley was born 4 January 1899 in Haverford, Pennsylvania[1] where his father Frank Morley was Professor of Mathematics at Haverford College.  In 1900 his father was named chairman of the mathematics department at Johns Hopkins University and the family removed to Baltimore, Maryland.[2] As had his two, older brothers, Christopher and Felix, Frank returned to Haverford College for his undergraduate education which, however, was interrupted in 1917 when Morley left school to serve as 2nd lieutenant in an Engineering unit based at Hog Island, Philadelphia, during World War I.[3][4]/nMorley received his bachelor's degree in 1918 from Johns Hopkins University.[5][6]  Morley won a Rhodes Scholarship, as did his two brothers, and attended New College, Oxford; they were the only family of three brothers to receive this prestigious scholarship.[7] Morley earned a doctorate in mathematics from Oxford in 1923.[8]   Morley remained in England, working at The Times Literary Supplement, and then as London manager for the publishers of The Century Magazine.[9] Geoffrey Faber hired Morley in 1929 to be co-director of the newly re-organized publishing firm Faber and Faber.[10]  In this capacity Morley worked with and became close friends with T. S. Eliot, then an editor at Faber and Faber.  Morley assisted Eliot in quickly finding new accommodation when Eliot separated from his wife.[11]  Eliot wrote the  poem \"Cows\" for Morley's children.[12]/nIn 1933 Morley and his father Frank Morley published the \"stimulating volume,\" Inversive Geometry.[13][14] The book develops complex numbers as a tool for geometry and function theory./nIn 1936 Morley's novel War Paint was published. Reviewing the book in The New English Weekly, George Orwell described it as \"an exceedingly na\u00efve adventure story, and at the same time a sort of Chelsea Hospital for superannuated jokes.\"[15]/nIn 1939 Morley left London for New York to become Vice-President, and Director of the Trade Editorial Department at Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich.[16]  Shortly thereafter Harcourt published \nMy Sister and I by Dirk van der Heide (1941), the story of the German bombing of Rotterdam ostensibly written by an 11-year-old refugee to England and thence to the United States. My Sister and I enjoyed considerable commercial and critical success, but in the 1980s was discovered to have been a literary fabrication conducted by Harcourt, under Morley's supervision, to encourage American participation in World War II, possibly with guidance or encouragement from British intelligence services.[17] During the war, Morley also served on the National War Labor Board.[18]  Following the war, Morley returned to England to become Director of the publisher Eyre & Spottiswoode from which he ultimately retired.[19][20]/nAs an editor and publisher, Morley enjoyed a wide correspondence and friendships with many prominent authors and literary figures of the day.  These included Eliot, Ezra Pound, Lewis Mumford, and Walter De la Mare, as well as Morley's eldest brother Christopher, who was a notable author and powerful promoter of literature.  It was Frank Morley who suggested to Pound in 1933 that he write an autobiography, which resulted in Pound's 1938 work Guide to Kulchur.[21]  Morley's literary correspondence is now held chiefly by the New York Public Library's Berg Collection.[22]/nWith his brother Christopher, Morley had long been an admirer of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Christopher originated The Baker Street Irregulars in 1934 as an informal meeting of his friends and others interested in Holmes, but in order to restrict membership to those who were truly knowledgeable if not expert in the stories, and eliminate mere casual readers of Conan Doyle, a membership test in the form of a crossword puzzle was devised by Frank V. Morley. This was published in Christopher's \"Bowling Green\" column in the May 1934 issue of the Saturday Review of Literature.[23]/nMorley traveled widely throughout England before and after the Second World War, incorporating his reading and observations into a number of non-fiction works of literary history and tourism, the last of which, Literary Britain, was published only days before his death on 8 October 1980 at age 82 in Buckinghamshire, England.[24]/nMorley married Christina McLeod Innes 14 May 1925.

The earlier estimates rely on the fact that Cleomedes refers extensively in his writing to the work of mathematician and astronomer Posidonius of Rhodes (c.\u2009135 \u2013 c.\u200951 BC), and yet seemingly not at all to the work of Ptolemy (c.\u2009100 \u2013 c.\u2009170 AD). (Cleomedes also refers to Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), Pytheas of Massalia (310\u2013306 BC), Aratus (c. 315/310 BC \u2013 240 BC), Eratosthenes (276\u2013195 BC), and Hipparchus (c.\u2009190 \u2013 c.\u2009120 BC). These conclusions have been challenged on the grounds that Cleomedes' work was in relatively elementary astronomy, and that reference to Ptolemy would not necessarily be expected.  The 20th century mathematician Otto Neugebauer, however, looked closely at the astronomical observations made by Cleomedes, and concluded that a date of 371 AD (\u00b150 years) better explains what is found there.  Neugebauer's estimate has been challenged on the grounds that Cleomedes makes observational errors with enough frequency that there is difficulty in deciding which observations to trust for the purpose of dating his work./nThe book for which Cleomedes is known is a fairly basic astronomy textbook in two volumes.  His purpose in writing seems to have been as philosophical as it was scientific\u2014he spends an extensive amount of time criticizing the scientific ideas of the Epicureans./nCleomedes' book is valued primarily for preserving, apparently verbatim, much of Posidonius' writings on astronomy (none of Posidonius' books have survived to the modern day). Cleomedes is accurate in some of his remarks on lunar eclipses, especially his conjecture that the shadow on the Moon suggests a spherical Earth. He also remarks presciently that the absolute size of many stars may exceed that of the Sun (and that the Earth might appear as a very small star, if viewed from the surface of the Sun)./nThis book is the original source for the well-known story of how Eratosthenes measured the Earth's circumference. Many modern mathematicians and astronomers believe the description to be reasonable (and believe Eratosthenes' achievement to be one of the more impressive accomplishments of ancient astronomy)./nCleomedes deserves credit for the earliest clear statement of the apparent distance explanation of the Sun Illusion or Moon Illusion. He argued that the sun appeared farther away on the horizon than in the zenith, and therefore larger (since its angular size was constant). He attributed this explanation to Posidonius./nAs a disciple of Posidonius, Cleomedes noted some elementary qualitative properties of refraction, such as the bending of a ray toward the perpendicular in passing from a less dense to a more dense medium, and suggested that due to atmospheric refraction, the Sun and its rainbow may be visible when the Sun is below the horizon.[1]/nCleomedes is now memorialized by the crater Cleomedes in the northeastern portion of the visible Moon.", "41205552": "Caius Iacob (March 29, 1912 \u2013 February 6, 1992) was a Romanian mathematician, professor at the University of Bucharest, and titular member of the Romanian Academy.

Muller received his BS in 1947 and his PhD in 1951 in physics from Caltech; an honorary PhD was conferred by the University of Paris in 1989.[1]  He was the inventor of the Muller C-element (or Muller C-gate), a device used to implement asynchronous circuitry in electronic computers. He also co-invented the Reed\u2013Muller codes. He discovered the codes, and Irving S. Reed proposed the majority logic decoding for the first time. Furthermore, he invented Muller automata, an automaton model for infinite words.[2] In geometric group theory Muller is known for the Muller\u2013Schupp theorem, joint with Paul Schupp, characterizing finitely generated virtually free groups as finitely generated groups with context-free word problem.[3]/nDavid E. Muller was the son of Hermann Joseph Muller and Jessie Jacobs Muller Offermann (formerly Jesse Marie Jacobs). He was born in Austin, Texas, when his parents taught at The University of Texas. His mother was one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics in the United States, and he credited her with inspiring his early interest in mathematics.[4] She lost her position as an instructor in pure mathematics at Texas because she became pregnant, and according to Hermann Joseph Muller's biographer, \"her colleagues felt that a mother could not give full attention to classroom duties and remain a good mother.\"[5] As a child he was with his parents in Berlin and Leningrad in 1933\u201334. His family was dissolved in the Soviet Union. He returned to Austin with his mother in July 1934. His mother obtained a divorce in Texas in the summer of 1935. Sometime between October 1935 and January 1936, Jessie Muller married Carlos Alberto Offermann, who had been working in Muller's laboratory and was on a visit to Austin from the Soviet Union at that time.[4] Hermann Joseph Muller left the Soviet Union in 1937 after the start of Stalin's political persecutions. After a brief stay in Madrid and Paris, in September 1937, Hermann moved to Edinburgh, where he married Dorothea Kantorowicz in May 1939. They had a daughter, Helen Juliette. Hermann Joseph Muller received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946./nDavid E. Muller died in 2008 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He is survived by his children, Chandra L.

This term New Nyaya is not to be understood as implying any great originality in theory on Gangesa's part, but rather originality in method. His work differs from the oldest Nyaya in that he accepts many tenets of the Vaisesika school, and in his arrangement of Nyaya teachings under four headings rather than under the 16 subjects (padartha) of the Old Nyaya./nThe newness of Gangesa's method is newness of style and of organization. He is far more precise, more careful to define his terms, than were his predecessors; these virtues of his work are responsible for the fact that perhaps half of Navya-Nyaya literature is based either directly on the T.C. or on a commentary on the T.C.[3]/n/nThis article about an Indian scientist is a stub.

His parents divorced not long after his birth, and his father, Arkadii Rubin, moved to England and was not part of Kaluznin's life. His mother, Maria Pavlovna Kaluznina, moved with the young Kaluznin to Petrograd (present-day Saint Petersburg), where she brought him up. She shared her love for Russian culture, including music and literature, with her son, and she would remain an important part of his life. In 1923, Kaluznin and his mother moved to Germany. She worked as a governess, while Kaluznin was enrolled at a Realgymnasium (secondary school), graduating in 1933. His school offered a thorough education in mathematics, and upon graduating, he entered the Humboldt University of Berlin, where he attended lectures taught by the algebraist Issai Schur.  He left the university in 1936 and enrolled at the University of Hamburg. Here, he was taught by Emil Artin, Erich Hecke and Hans Zassenhaus. In 1938 he published his first paper, in which he completed a theorem of Kurosh on the classification of abelian groups.[1][2]/nIn 1938, Kaluznin and his mother moved to Paris, where Kaluznin became a student at the Sorbonne. World War II and in particular the German occupation of Paris in June 1940 made it necessary for him to halt his studies. To make a living, he trained as an electrician. On 22 June 1941, Soviet citizens living in France were interned at a camp in Compi\u00e8gne near Paris. Here, Kaluznin was initially able to continue studying mathematics, carrying out research on Galois theory, which determines if certain equation solutions can be written with rational functions. He also attended lectures on a variety of topics given by other prisoners.[1]/nIn March 1942, Kaluznin was moved to a concentration camp in Wahlsburg, Bavaria. Conditions here were much more difficult than in the internment camp back in France. His mother was able to send him food while he was at the concentration camp. Otherwise, he might not have survived.[1] After the war, Kaluznin returned to Paris. He got some work translating for the Soviet Embassy in Paris but was finally able to return to his mathematical studies. In 1948, he defended his doctoral dissertation on Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups. In the following years, he published several papers, some of them with Marc Krasner, and presented his research at academic conferences.[2]/nKaluznin and his mother decided to move back to the USSR. They applied to the Soviet immigration authorities, who requested that he should work in East Germany, where there was a shortage of scientists, for some time. In 1951, Kaluznin returned to Humboldt University in Berlin. Here, he held a post of Hochschuldozent, and following the presentation of his Habilitation thesis on stable automorphism groups, a post as Privatdozent, or full professor.[2][1]/nFinally, in 1955, Kaluznin was able to return to the USSR.

In 1957 he had to defend a third thesis titled \u2018Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups. Complete products of groups. Generalizations of Galois theory.\u2019 In 1959 he created and became head of the department of algebra and mathematical logic; he also promoted the creation of a department of mathematical linguistics at the state university,[1] maybe due to his marriage in 1962 to linguist Zoya Mikhailovna Volotskaya. They lived separate most of their life but did have two children.[2]/nDue to his time abroad in Germany and France, he was seen as a foreigner. In the 1970s, after openly pronouncing his opinion against closed political trials, he had to leave a couple of the positions he had, including his position as head of department of algebra and mathematical logic. This prevented him from going to conferences abroad, and he had to try to do his work by mail. He focused on his students, various research projects and the new area of computer algebra. His students very much enjoyed his lectures. In the mid 1980s his son Mikhail came under government scrutiny due to Mikhail's interest in religion, which did not make things easier for his father. Eventually Kaluznin was forced to retire and moved back to Moscow.[1] His health deteriorated, and he died as a result of burns from an accident.[2][1]/nOutside of mathematics, Kaluznin had many interests. He loved classical music, philosophy and western literature. Until 1970, he was a very heavy smoker, sometimes smoking as many as 60 cigarettes a day. Finally, on 1 January 1970, he stopped and never smoked again. He was a good dresser and enjoyed red wine and beer.[2][1]/nKaluznin's research spread wide most notably in group theory and abstract groups. He worked on the Sylow p-subgroups of symmetric groups and even mathematical linguistics. Despite not being able to go to many conferences he contributed to the application of computers in algebra.[3][4] The universal embedding theorem is sometimes called the \"Krasner-Kaloujnine universal embedding theorem\" due to his joint proof of the theorem with Marc Krasner./nInvestigations in Algebraic Theory of Combinatorial Objects[5]", "48217935": "Yael Naim Dowker (born Yael Naim; 30 October 1919 \u2013 28 January 2016)[1] was an Israeli-born english mathematician, prominent especially due to her work in the fields of measure theory, ergodic theory and topological dynamics./nYael Naim (later Dowker) was born in Tel Aviv.[1] She left for the United States to study at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

As a physicist, Stokes made seminal contributions to fluid mechanics, including the Navier\u2013Stokes equations; and to physical optics, with notable works on polarization and fluorescence. As a mathematician, he popularised \"Stokes' theorem\" in vector calculus and contributed to the theory of asymptotic expansions. Stokes, along with Felix Hoppe-Seyler, first demonstrated the oxygen transport function of haemoglobin, and showed colour changes produced by the aeration of haemoglobin solutions./nStokes was made a baronet by the British monarch in 1889. In 1893 he received the Royal Society's Copley Medal, then the most prestigious scientific prize in the world, \"for his researches and discoveries in physical science\". He represented Cambridge University in the British House of Commons from 1887 to 1892, sitting as a Conservative. Stokes also served as president of the Royal Society from 1885 to 1890 and was briefly the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge./nGeorge Stokes was the youngest son of the Reverend Gabriel Stokes (died 1834), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland who served as rector of Skreen in County Sligo, and his wife Elizabeth Haughton, daughter of the Reverend John Haughton. Stokes' home life was strongly influenced by his father's evangelical Protestantism: three of his brothers entered the Church, of whom the most eminent was John Whitley Stokes, Archdeacon of Armagh.[1]/nJohn and George were always close, and George lived with John while attending school in Dublin. Of all his family he was closest to his sister Elizabeth. Their mother was remembered in the family as \"beautiful but very stern\". After attending schools in Skreen, Dublin and Bristol, in 1837 Stokes matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Four years later he graduated as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman, achievements that earned him election as a fellow of the college.[2]/nIn accordance with the college statutes, Stokes had to resign the fellowship when he married in 1857. Twelve years later, under new statutes, he was re-elected to the fellowship and he retained that place until 1902, when on the day before his 83rd birthday, he was elected as the college's Master. Stokes did not hold that position for long, for he died at Cambridge on 1 February the following year,[3] and was buried in the Mill Road cemetery. There is also a memorial to him in the north aisle at Westminster Abbey.[4]/nIn 1849, Stokes was appointed to the Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge, a position he held until his death in 1903. On 1 June 1899, the jubilee of this appointment was celebrated there in a ceremony attended by numerous delegates from European and American universities. A commemorative gold medal was presented to Stokes by the chancellor of the university and marble busts of Stokes by Hamo Thornycroft were formally offered to Pembroke College and to the university by Lord Kelvin. At 54 years, Stokes' tenure as the Lucasian Professor was the longest in history./nStokes, who was made a baronet in 1889, further served his university by representing it in parliament from 1887 to 1892 as one of the two members for the Cambridge University constituency. In 1885\u20131890 he was also president of the Royal Society, of which he had been one of the secretaries since 1854. As he was also Lucasian Professor at this time, Stokes was the first person to hold all three positions simultaneously; Newton held the same three, although not at the same time.[3]/nStokes was the oldest of the trio of natural philosophers, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Kelvin being the other two, who especially contributed to the fame of the Cambridge school of mathematical physics in the middle of the 19th century./nStokes's original work began about 1840, and is distinguished for its quantity and quality. The Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers gives the titles of over a hundred memoirs by him published down to 1883. Some of these are only brief notes, others are short controversial or corrective statements, but many are long and elaborate treatises.[5]/nIn scope, his work covered a wide range of physical inquiry but, as Marie Alfred Cornu remarked in his Rede Lecture of 1899,[6] the greater part of it was concerned with waves and the transformations imposed on them during their passage through various media.[7]/nStokes's first published papers, which appeared in 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion.[8][9] These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids,[10] and in 1850 by another on the effects of the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums.[11] To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound[12] and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced by the nature of the gas in which the sound is produced.[13] These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in the air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships.[7]/nStokes's work on fluid motion and viscosity led to his calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium.[14] This became known as Stokes' law. He derived an expression for the frictional force (also called drag force) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers.[citation needed]/nHis work is the basis of the falling sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes's law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.[citation needed]/nThe same theory explains why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and hail). Similar use of the equation can be made in the settlement of fine particles in water or other fluids.[citation needed]/n\"stokes\", the CGS unit of kinematic viscosity, was named in recognition of his work./nPerhaps his best-known researches are those which deal with the wave theory of light. His optical work began at an early period in his scientific career. His first papers on the aberration of light appeared in 1845 and 1846,[15][16] and were followed in 1848 by one on the theory of certain bands seen in the spectrum.[17][7]/nIn 1849 he published a long paper on the dynamical theory of diffraction, in which he showed that the plane of polarisation must be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.[18] Two years later he discussed the colours of thick plates.[19][7]/nStokes also investigated George Airy's mathematical description of rainbows.[20] Airy's findings involved an integral that was awkward to evaluate. Stokes expressed the integral as a divergent series, which were little understood. However, by cleverly truncating the series (i.e., ignoring all except the first few terms of the series), Stokes obtained an accurate approximation to the integral that was far easier to evaluate than the integral itself.[21] Stokes's research on asymptotic series led to fundamental insights about such series.[22]/nIn 1852, in his famous paper on the change of wavelength of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible.[23] The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes's honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, is the basis of Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had heard an account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.[24]/nIn the same year, 1852, there appeared the paper on the composition and resolution of streams of polarised light from different sources,[25] and in 1853 an investigation of the metallic reflection exhibited by certain non-metallic substances.[26] The research was to highlight the phenomenon of light polarisation. About 1860 he was engaged in an inquiry on the intensity of light reflected from, or transmitted through, a pile of plates;[27] and in 1862 he prepared for the British Association a valuable report on double refraction,[7] a phenomenon where certain crystals show different refractive indices along different axes.[28] Perhaps the best known crystal is Iceland spar, transparent calcite crystals./nA paper on the long spectrum of the electric light bears the same date,[29] and was followed by an inquiry into the absorption spectrum of blood.[7][30]/nThe chemical identification of organic bodies by their optical properties was treated in 1864;[31] and later, in conjunction with the Rev. William Vernon Harcourt, he investigated the relation between the chemical composition and the optical properties of various glasses, with reference to the conditions of transparency and the improvement of achromatic telescopes.[32] A still later paper connected with the construction of optical instruments discussed the theoretical limits to the aperture of microscope objectives.[33][7]/nIn 1849, Stokes invented the Stokes lens to detect astigmatism.[34] It is a lens combination consisted of equal but opposite power cylindrical lenses attached together in such a way so that the lenses can be rotated relative to one another.[35]/nIn other areas of physics may be mentioned his paper on the conduction of heat in crystals (1851)[36] and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer;[37] his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside the outline of a dark body seen against the sky (1882);[38] and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains.[39] Two long papers published in 1849 \u2013 one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem,[40] and the other on the variation of gravity at the surface of the Earth (1849) \u2013 Stokes' gravity formula[41]\u2014also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847)[42] and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850)[43] and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849),[44][7] research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee Bridge disaster of 1847./nMany of Stokes' discoveries were not published, or were only touched upon in the course of his oral lectures. One such example is his work in the theory of spectroscopy.[7]/nIn his presidential address to the British Association in 1871, Lord Kelvin stated his belief that the application of the prismatic analysis of light to solar and stellar chemistry had never been suggested directly or indirectly by anyone else when Stokes taught it to him at Cambridge University some time prior to the summer of 1852, and he set forth the conclusions, theoretical and practical, which he learnt from Stokes at that time, and which he afterwards gave regularly in his public lectures at Glasgow.[45]/nThese statements, containing as they do the physical basis on which spectroscopy rests, and the way in which it is applicable to the identification of substances existing in the sun and stars, make it appear that Stokes anticipated Gustav Kirchhoff by at least seven or eight years. Stokes, however, in a letter published some years after the delivery of this address, stated that he had failed to take one essential step in the argument\u2014not perceiving that emission of light of definite wavelength not merely permitted, but necessitated, absorption of light of the same wavelength. He modestly disclaimed \"any part of Kirchhoff's admirable discovery,\" adding that he felt some of his friends had been over-zealous in his cause.[46] It must be said, however, that English men of science have not accepted this disclaimer in all its fullness, and still attribute to Stokes the credit of having first enunciated the fundamental principles of spectroscopy.[7]/nIn another way, too, Stokes did much for the progress of mathematical physics. Soon after he was elected to the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university with difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society, he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.[7]/nStokes was involved in several investigations into railway accidents, especially the Dee Bridge disaster in May 1847, and he served as a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the use of cast iron in railway structures. He contributed to the calculation of the forces exerted by moving engines on bridges. The bridge failed because a cast iron beam was used to support the loads of passing trains. Cast iron is brittle in tension or bending, and many other similar bridges had to be demolished or reinforced./nHe appeared as an expert witness at the Tay Bridge disaster, where he gave evidence about the effects of wind loads on the bridge. The centre section of the bridge (known as the High Girders) was completely destroyed during a storm on 28 December 1879, while an express train was in the section, and everyone aboard died (more than 75 victims). The Board of Inquiry listened to many expert witnesses, and concluded that the bridge was \"badly designed, badly built and badly maintained\".[47]/nAs a result of his evidence, he was appointed a member of the subsequent Royal Commission into the effect of wind pressure on structures. The effects of high winds on large structures had been neglected at that time, and the commission conducted a series of measurements across Britain to gain an appreciation of wind speeds during storms, and the pressures they exerted on exposed surfaces./nStokes generally held conservative religious values and beliefs. In 1886, he became president of the Victoria Institute, which had been founded to defend evangelical Christian principles against challenges from the new sciences, especially the Darwinian theory of biological evolution. He gave the 1891 Gifford lecture on natural theology.[48][49] He was also the vice-president of the British and Foreign Bible Society and was actively involved in doctrinal debates concerning missionary work.[50] However, although his religious views were mostly orthodox, he was unusual among Victorian evangelicals in rejecting eternal punishment in hell, and instead was a proponent of Christian conditionalism.[51]/nAs President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: \"We all admit that the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that consequently there can be no real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, we must remember that we are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion\".[52]/nHe married, on 4 July 1857 at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, Mary Susanna Robinson, daughter of the astronomer Rev Thomas Romney Robinson. They had five children: Arthur Romney, who inherited the baronetcy; Susanna Elizabeth, who died in infancy; Isabella Lucy (Mrs Laurence Humphry) who contributed the personal memoir of her father in \"Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of the Late George Gabriel Stokes, Bart\"; Dr William George Gabriel, physician, a troubled man who committed suicide aged 30 while temporarily insane; and Dora Susanna, who died in infancy. His male line and hence his baronetcy have since become extinct./nStokes's mathematical and physical papers (see external links) were published in a collected form in five volumes; the first three (Cambridge, 1880, 1883, and 1901) under his own editorship, and the two last (Cambridge, 1904 and 1905) under that of Sir Joseph Larmor, who also selected and arranged the Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of Stokes published at Cambridge in 1907.[59]", "63651687": "Anna Katarzyna Panorska is a Polish mathematician and statistician who works as a professor in the department of mathematics and statistics at the University of Nevada, Reno.[1]/nPanorska's research interests include studying extreme events in the stochastic processes used to model weather, water, and biology.[2] She has also studied the effects of weather conditions on baseball performance, concluding that temperature has a larger effect than wind and humidity.[3]/nPanorska studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw, completing a degree in 1986. After earning a master's degree in statistics at the University of Texas at El Paso in 1988, she returned to mathematics for her doctoral studies, completing a Ph.D. at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1992.[4] Her dissertation, Generalized Convolutions, was supervised by Svetlozar Rachev.[5]/nShe became an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1992, but left academia in 1997 to work as a biostatistician for BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee.

B. S. Haldane. Maynard Smith was instrumental in the application of game theory to evolution with George R. Price, and theorised on other problems such as the evolution of sex and signalling theory./nJohn Maynard Smith was born in London, the son of the surgeon Sidney Maynard Smith, but following his father's death in 1928, the family moved to Exmoor, where he became interested in natural history. Quite unhappy with the lack of formal science education at Eton College, Maynard Smith took it upon himself to develop an interest in Darwinian evolutionary theory and mathematics, after having read the work of old Etonian J. B. S. Haldane, whose books were in the school's library despite the bad reputation Haldane had at Eton for his communism. He became an atheist at age 14.[2]/nOn leaving school, Maynard Smith joined the Communist Party of Great Britain and started studying engineering at Trinity College, Cambridge.[3] When the Second World War broke out in 1939, he defied his party's line and volunteered for service. He was rejected, however, because of poor eyesight and was told to finish his engineering degree, which he did in 1941. He later quipped that \"under the circumstances, my poor eyesight was a selective advantage\u2014it stopped me getting shot\". The year of his graduation, he married Sheila Matthew, and they later had two sons and one daughter (Tony, Carol, and Julian). Between 1942 and 1947, he applied his degree to military aircraft design./nMaynard Smith, having decided that aircraft were \"noisy and old-fashioned\",[4] then took a change of career, entering University College London to study fruit fly genetics under Haldane.[3] After graduating he became a lecturer in zoology at his alma mater between 1952 and 1965, where he directed the Drosophila lab and conducted research on population genetics. He published a popular Penguin book, The Theory of Evolution, in 1958 (with subsequent editions in 1966, 1975, 1993)./nHe became gradually less attracted to communism and became a less active member, finally leaving the party in 1956[5] like many other intellectuals, after the Soviet Union brutally suppressed the Hungarian Revolution (Haldane had left the party in 1950 after becoming similarly disillusioned). He also admitted that a research program in evolutionary biology explicitly informed by Marxism seemed to bear little fruit.[6]/nIn 1962 he was one of the founding members of the University of Sussex and was a dean between 1965 and 1985. He subsequently became a professor emeritus. Prior to his death the building housing much of life sciences at Sussex was renamed the John Maynard Smith Building in his honour./nIn 1973 Maynard Smith formalised a central concept in evolutionary game theory called the evolutionarily stable strategy,[7] based on a verbal argument by George R. Price. This area of research culminated in his 1982 book Evolution and the Theory of Games. The Hawk-Dove game is arguably his single most influential game theoretical model./nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1977. In 1986 he was awarded the Darwin Medal./nMaynard Smith published a book titled The Evolution of Sex which explored in mathematical terms, the notion of the \"two-fold cost of sex\". During the late 1980s he also became interested in evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) and worked with the evolutionary biologist E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry.[3] Together they wrote an influential 1995 book The Major Transitions in Evolution, a seminal work which continues to contribute to ongoing issues in evolutionary biology.[8][9] A popular science version of the book, The Origins of Life: From the birth of life to the origin of language, was published in 1999./nIn 1991 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for genetics and evolution \"for his powerful analysis of evolutionary theory and of the role of sexual reproduction as a critical factor in evolution and in the survival of species; for his mathematical models applying the theory of games to evolutionary problems\" (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee).

He was survived by his wife Sheila and their children./nAnother evolutionary biologist, William Donald Hamilton, harboured a grievance against Maynard Smith for his handling of an article that Hamilton submitted to The Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1963, which was eventually published as two papers in July 1964.[10][11] Maynard Smith acted as a reviewer of the paper after two other reviewers had been unable to understand it, and requested that Hamilton revise it into two parts due to concerns about its accessibility, later describing it as \"deeply obscure\".[11][12] In March 1964, Maynard Smith published the article \"Group Selection and Kin selection\" in Nature, which covered concepts from Hamilton's article.[13] Although Maynard Smith cited an earlier paper by Hamilton published in the American Naturalist, Hamilton felt Maynard Smith had not given him sufficient credit.[10][11] Hamilton also objected to an anecdote included by Maynard Smith in a review published in the New Scientist in 1976 which implied Maynard Smith's mentor Haldane had understood the concept of Hamilton's inclusive fitness in the 1950s.[11][12] Hamilton replied to the review suggesting that the anecdote was false, but later apologised to Maynard Smith for having doubted it.[10][11]/nThe John Maynard Smith Archive is housed at the British Library (Add MS 86569-86840).

Her father died in the First World War. As a 'war orphan', Weber was eligible for financial support, and she attended a convent school.[1]/nIn 1929, she began studies in chemistry and mathematics at the University of Cologne, but switched a year later to the University of G\u00f6ttingen. She graduated with a first class honours degree in 1935, and then trained as a teacher for two years. As she did not join the Nazi party, she was not allowed to join a teaching post. Her remaining family, comprising her mother and sister, were in need of financial support, so she sought employment in the armaments industry.[1]/nWeber joined Krupp in Essen as a researcher in ballistics. Her work involved tedious mathematical computations using the Brunsviga mechanical calculators./nIn 1939, Weber joined the Aerodynamics Research Institute (Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt G\u00f6ttingen) in G\u00f6ttingen. She was part of a small theoretical team, and her initial training in aerodynamics consisted of wind tunnel corrections. Here she met and began her lifelong collaboration with Dietrich K\u00fcchemann.[1]/nScientists at Institute had by then worked out a consistent theory of flow around an aircraft. This was, however, an approximation, using singularities to represent the vortices that generated lift, and Weber was given the task of improving it. She realised that some of her work overlapped with K\u00fcchemann's research on jet engine intakes. They teamed up, with Weber doing the theoretical development and wind tunnel testing, and K\u00fcchemann setting the direction of their research based on his consultation with manufacturers. Over the period of the Second World War, they created a substantial body of work.[1]/nFollowing the capture of G\u00f6ttingen by the US Army in 1945, the city fell into the British occupation zone. The British paid Weber and K\u00fcchemann to compile a monograph of their researches. These would form the basis of their text Aerodynamics of Propulsion. They also encouraged German scientists to take up six month contracts at various defence facilities in the UK as part of the combined US-UK plan (Operation Paperclip and Operation Surgeon) to acquire German services and technologies. In October 1946, K\u00fcchemann joined the Aerodynamics department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnbourough, and persuaded Weber to join him. Both of them continued to renew their six-month contracts, although both remained classed as enemy aliens, until 1953 when both were naturalised as British citizens.[1]/nWeber, as the only woman among the German scientists, was accommodated at an RAE staff hostel. She joined the Low Speed Wind Tunnels division at the RAE, which was headed by Frances Bradfield. She began experimental work on air intakes under John Seddon.[1]/nIn 1946, the British Air Ministry specified a medium-range jet propelled bomber capable of carrying a nuclear weapon. The Handley Page Victor bomber was the most ambitious of the designs proposed in response. K\u00fcchemann had kept abreast of German work into swept-wing aircraft, in particular the crescent-shaped wing, and the aerodynamics of supersonic flight. The Victor would have three segmented wings of crescent shape, each with a different sweep angle. Weber assisted with the calculations, and incorporated further design improvements including the engine air inputs based on the work she had done with K\u00fcchemann during the war. Her linear and simple aerodynamic models were calculated by hand by a team of women 'computors'. In September 1945, she co-wrote with K\u00fcchemann a paper analysing the aerodynamics of the new wing and fuselage.[1]/nWeber's subsequent work with K\u00fcchemann was in improving the theory of subsonic aerodynamics. Initial methods treated wing thickness and lift in isolation. In the 1950s, she developed a simultaneous treatment of all the features of a wing (thickness, twist, sweepback, camber) to predict the air pressure distribution over it. The Vickers aircraft team then solved the inverse problem - that of determining the wing shape that best suited a required pressure distribution. The resultant wing shape, the most advanced for a civilian craft, was used on the Vickers VC10 airliner.[1]/nWeber also began her research into supersonic transport. In 1955, she showed that a thin delta wing with a high angle of attack could generate sufficient lift to provide the take-off and landing capability, while simultaneously enabling efficient supersonic performance. K\u00fcchemann then advocated this wing configuration with the UK Government, resulting in the support for a Mach 2  airliner by the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC) in 1956.[1]/nIn 1961, a prototype aircraft, the Handley Page HP.115, was built to test the low speed performance of the slender delta wing.[2]/nWeber made two fundamental contributions to the supersonic effort: tools to predict the drag on a slender delta-winged aircraft during supersonic flight, and shaping the wing to allow the formation of vortices at its leading edge, rather than above or below it. Her work from 1959 onwards contributed to the design and the eventual construction of the Concorde.[1]/nWeber reverted to subsonic researches following the Concorde. In particular, she analysed the conditions under which methods addressing airflows slower than the speed of sound continued to be applicable at supercritical levels. Her refinement of existing theories, which were based on incompressible flows, helped automate the computations to render exact, rather than approximate, solutions. One of the chief sources of aerodynamic inefficiency was the junction of the wing and the fuselage, and she was able to model its entire three-dimensional profile. These methods, along with others evolving from the development of the VC10, were used in the design of the Airbus A300B aircraft, the first wide-body twinjet in the world.[1]/nWeber retired in 1975 at the grade of Senior Principal Scientific Officer, and continued to be retained by the RAE as a consultant. She had nearly 100 papers to her name. In 1976, following K\u00fcchemann's death, Weber assisted in the publication of his book The Aerodynamic Design of Aircraft, which was published in 1978. She announced that she was done with aerodynamics after that.[1]/nWeber remained unmarried all her life. She lived in the RAE hostel until 1953, and then moved into a bedsit attached to K\u00fcchemann's house in Wrecclesham, Surrey, where she lived till 1961, when she acquired the house next door to the K\u00fcchemanns. She found it difficult to obtain a mortgage, as banks and building societies tended not to lend to single women for home purchases at the time.[3][4]/nAfter retirement, Weber discovered new interests in psychology and geology, taking classes at the University of Surrey.[2]/nWeber's younger sister, to whom she was very close, had been in poor health for most of her life. Weber supported her and their mother financially, sending money to Germany, and wanted to return to them.[2] Her sister died at the age of 50.[3]/nWeber lived in her house till 2010.

She was awarded a Clothworker's Guild Scholarship to study at Girton College, Cambridge, where she matriculated in 1889. A fellow student who matriculated at Girton at the same time as Maddison was Grace Chisholm (later Grace Chisholm Young). Maddison attended lectures at Cambridge by Cayley, Whitehead and Young. In 1892 Maddison passed the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam earning a First Class degree, equal to the twenty-seventh Wrangler, but she was not allowed to receive a degree, as, at this time, women could not formally receive a degree at Cambridge.[1] Instead, she was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science with Honors from the University of London in 1893.[1] Her fellow student Grace Chisholm also earned a First Class degree in the same Mathematical Tripos examinations./nOn completing her studies at Cambridge, Maddison was awarded a scholarship which enabled her to spend the year 1892\u201393 at Bryn Mawr College in the US. There she undertook research under the direction of Charlotte Scott, the first woman to earn a First Class degree at Cambridge (in 1880).[2]  Maddison was awarded the resident mathematics fellowship,[2] and then a Mary E. Garrett Fellowship for study abroad. She used the latter to study at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in the academic year 1893-1894,where she attended lectures by Felix Klein and David Hilbert.[2]  Right before that, in 1893, Maddison sat the University of London exams, and as a result was awarded a BSc with Honors.[2] \nShe received her PhD from Bryn Mawr in 1896./nMaddison had, like Scott, become interested in linear algebra through the influence of Cayley at Cambridge. When she first reached Bryn Mawr College, Maddison continued to work on this topic but later, advised by Scott, she began to work on singular solutions of differential equations. Although she had earned the equivalent of a First Class degree at Cambridge, Maddison still had no degree so she took the external examinations of the University of London in 1893 which allowed her to graduate with a BSc with honours. Bryn Mawr College awarded her their Residential Mathematical Fellowship which funded her studies for the year 1893\u201394. She was next awarded the Mary E.

Carey Thomas. Until 1902, M. Carey Thomas held both the position of dean and of president, so Maddison had a busy life as her assistant. It was a position which took up so much of her time that she was unable to continue with mathematical research, but she did complete her doctorate under Scott's supervision./nShe was awarded a PhD in 1896 for her thesis On Singular Solutions of Differential Equations of the First Order in Two Variables and the Geometrical Properties of Certain Invariants and Covariants of Their Complete Primitives and in the same year appointed as Reader in Mathematics at Bryn Mawr. Her paper On certain factors of c- and p-discriminants and their relations to fixed points in the family of curves which she published in the Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics was based on her doctoral dissertation and she was awarded the Gambel Prize.

However, with the help of his wife Edith, he was able to continue to work and do mathematics at the highest level, even when he was barely able to walk and speak./nPiatetski-Shapiro was born in 1929 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Both his father, Iosif Grigor'evich, and mother, Sofia Arkadievna, were from traditional Jewish families, which had become assimilated. His father was from Berdichev, a small city in the Ukraine, with a largely Jewish population. His mother was from Gomel, a similar small city in Belorussia. Both parents' families were middle-class, but they sank into poverty after the October revolution of 1917.

Gelfond, a professor of mathematics at Moscow University and an important Communist Party member (Gelfond\u2019s father was a friend of Lenin), Piatetski-Shapiro\u2019s application to graduate program at Moscow University was rejected. He was ultimately admitted to the Moscow Pedagogical Institute, where he received his Ph.D. in 1954 under the direction of Alexander Buchstab. His early work was in classical analytic number theory.

His contact with Shafarevich, who was a professor at the Steklov Institute, broadened Piatetski-Shapiro's mathematical outlook and directed his attention to modern number theory and algebraic geometry. This led, after a while, to the joint paper [6]  in which they proved a Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces./nPiatetski-Shapiro in 1958 was made a professor of mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Applied Mathematics, where he introduced Siegel domains. By the 1960s, he was recognized as a star mathematician. In 1965 he was appointed to an additional professorship at Moscow State University. He conducted seminars for advanced students, among them Grigory Margulis (now at Yale) and David Kazhdan (now at Hebrew University). He was invited to attend 1962 International Congress of Mathematicians in Stockholm, but was not allowed to go by Soviet authorities (Shafarevich, also invited, presented his talk).

Together with Graev, they wrote the book Automorphic Forms and Representations.[8]/nDuring the early 1970s, a growing number of Soviet Jews were permitted to emigrate to Israel. The anti-Jewish behavior in the Soviet Union, however, was not enough to make Piatetski-Shapiro want to leave his country. What shook him to the core was the difficulty of maintaining a Jewish identity and the enforced conformity to communism around him in the scientific community. He didn\u2019t wish this future for his son, sixteen at the time.[citation needed]/nPiatetski-Shapiro lost his part-time position at mathematics department of Moscow State University in 1973, after he signed a letter asking Soviet authorities to release a dissident mathematician Alexander Esenin-Volpin from a mental institution.

The authorities refused to grant him an exit visa, claiming that he was too valuable a scientist to be allowed to leave. As a refusenik, he lost access to mathematical libraries and other academic resources. He continued his researches nevertheless, and colleagues took books from the library for him.[citation needed]/nAs a prominent refusenik with connections to an international scientific community, Piatetski-Shapiro was followed around by a KGB car and his apartment was under electronic surveillance. He conducted his meetings with friends and colleagues by writing on a plastic board, especially when he needed to communicate about his situation. His plight as a mathematician, with serious restrictions on his researches and without means for survival, attracted much attention in the U.S. and Europe.[citation needed] In 1976, a presentation was made to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences urging the use of their good offices to get Piatetski-Shapiro an exit visa. Later that year, he obtained one. His second marriage ended as his then-current wife remained in Moscow.  He visited colleagues all over the world who had signed petitions and fought for his freedom before going to Israel. He was welcomed warmly upon arrival in Israel and accepted a professorship at Tel Aviv University. He was elected into Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1978.[9]/nAfter leaving Soviet  Union, Piatetski-Shapiro also visited the USA in 1976 and spent a semester as a visiting professor at University of Maryland.[citation needed]/nStarting in 1977, Piatetski-Shapiro divided his time between Tel Aviv University and Yale University, directing doctoral dissertations in both places. One of his major works at Yale dealt with the converse theorem which establishes a link between automorphic forms on n by n matrix groups and zeta functions.[citation needed]/nFor n = 1 this theorem is classical. The assertion for n = 2 was proved by Andr\u00e9 Weil, and the novel version for n = 3 was conceived by Piatetski-Shapiro while he was still a refusenik in the Soviet Union.  It took another 25 years and works with other collaborators, in particular his student James Cogdell, before a full result for the general case was completed.[10][11][12][13]/nThe converse theorem has played a role in many of the results known in the direction of the principle of functoriality of Langlands./nPiatetski-Shapiro battled Parkinson's disease for the last 30 years of his life.  His condition worsened in the last 10 years to the point where he was barely able to move and speak, but thanks to the support of his wife Edith, he was still able to travel to mathematical conferences.  With the help of James Cogdell he was able to continue research until almost his last days.[citation needed]/nHe was married three times and had a son, Gregory I.

After a year in Bonn doing research in experimental physics under Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, Yule returned to University College in 1893 to work as a demonstrator for Karl Pearson, one of his former teachers. Pearson was beginning to work in statistics and Yule followed him into this new field.

During the First World War Yule worked for the army and then for the Ministry of Food. A heart attack in 1931 left him semi-invalided and led to his early retirement. His flow of publications almost ceased but, in the 1940s he found new interests, one of which led to a book, The Statistical Study of Literary Vocabulary./nYule was a prolific writer, the highlight of his publications being perhaps the textbook Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, which went through fourteen editions and was published in several languages.[6] He was active in the Royal Statistical Society, was awarded its Guy Medal in Gold in 1911, and served as its president in 1924\u201326./nYule's first paper on statistics appeared in 1895: \"On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief\". Yule was interested in applying statistical techniques to social problems and he quickly became a member of the Royal Statistical Society. For many years the only members interested in mathematical statistics were Yule, Edgeworth and Bowley. In 1897\u201399 Yule wrote important papers on correlation and regression. After 1900 he worked on a parallel theory of association. His approach to association was quite different from Pearson's and relations between them deteriorated. Yule had broad interests and his collaborators included the agricultural meteorologist R. H. Hooker, the medical statistician Major Greenwood and the agricultural scientist Sir Frank Engledow. Yule's sympathy towards the newly rediscovered Mendelian theory of genetics led to several papers./nIn the 1920s Yule wrote three influential papers on time series analysis, \"On the time-correlation problem\" (1921), a critique of the variate difference method, an investigation of a form of spurious correlation[7] (1926) and \"On a Method of Investigating Periodicities in Disturbed Series, with Special Reference to Wolfer's Sunspot Numbers\" (1927), which used an autoregressive model to model the sunspot time series instead of the established periodogram method of Schuster./nIn 1922, J. C. Willis published Age and Area, based on botanical field work in Ceylon, where he studied the distributional patterns of the Ceylonese vascular plants in great detail. He compiled a table of the number of existent species in each genus of flowering plants, and the same for the Rubiaceae, and for the Chrysomelid beetles./nLet \n\n\n\ny\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(x)}\n\n be the number of genera with \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n existent species. When \n\n\n\ny\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(x)}\n\n is plotted on a log-log plot, each of these follows a straight line. This shows that \n\n\n\ny\n(\nx\n)\n\u221d\n\nx\n\na\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y(x)\\propto x^{a}}\n\n for some \n\n\n\na\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a}\n\n. That is, the distribution has a power-law tail. The figures are found in,[8] or [9] page 241 and 242./nIn 1925 Yule published the paper \"A Mathematical Theory of Evolution, based on the Conclusions of Dr. J. C. Willis, F.R.S.\", where he proposed a stochastic process which reproduces the power-law tail.[2] \nThis was later called the Yule process, but is now better known as preferential attachment.\nHerbert A. Simon dubbed the resulting distribution the Yule distribution in his honour./nFrank Yates culminated his 1952 obituary of Yule by saying:/n\u201cTo summarize we may, I think, justly conclude that though Yule did not fully develop any completely new branches of statistical theory, he took the first steps in many directions which were later to prove fruitful lines for further progress\u2026 He can indeed rightly claim to be one of the pioneers of modern statistics\u201d.[11]/nYule made important contributions to the theory and practice of correlation, regression, and association, as well as to time series analysis. He pioneered the use of preferential attachment stochastic processes to explain the origin of power law distribution. The Yule distribution, a discrete power law, is named after him./nAlthough Yule taught at Cambridge for twenty years, he had little impact on the development of statistics there. M. S. Bartlett recalled him as a \"mentor\" but his famous association with Maurice Kendall, who revised the Introduction to the Theory of Statistics, only came about after Kendall had graduated.", "64700348": "Jill E.

In 1919, he earned another master's, this time in electrical engineering, from Union College nearby,[2] and spend the period 1920-1923 teaching there, while earning his PhD (awarded 1923). The rest of his career was spent at GE./nHe published mathematical papers on and off for several decades, and spoke twice at the International Congress of Mathematics (ICM).

He took a number of solar power patents, wrote a number of books and publicized his work. Baer served on the board of directors of the U.S. Section of the International Solar Energy Society, and on the board of the New Mexico Solar Energy Association. He was the founder, chairman of the board, president, and director of research at Zomeworks Corporation.[2]/nSteve Baer was born in Los Angeles. In his teens while a student at Midland School, he read Lewis Mumford and decided technology needn\u2019t necessarily degrade or complicate people's lives. In the latter 1950s, Baer worked at various jobs and attended Amherst College and UCLA. In 1960, he joined the U.S. Army, being stationed in Germany for three years. He also was married in 1960. After discharge from the Army, he and his wife, Holly settled in Zurich, Switzerland, where he worked as a welder and attended Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, studying mathematics. Here he became interested in the possibilities of building innovative structures using polyhedra (non-rectangular polyhedrons)./nBaer and his wife moved back to the United States, settling in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Baer initially worked as a welder of trailer frames for the Fruehauf Trailer Services company. He founded the company Zomeworks with Barry Hickman and Ed Heinz./nBear and Ed Heinz experimented with constructing buildings of unusual geometries that they came to call \"zomes,\" often using heavy sheet metal as the main exterior material. Some of the earliest experiments were carried out in cooperation with members of the intentional communities Drop City and Manara Nueva./nBaer had also become interested in using solar energy for direct heating of buildings, inspired by reading Farrington Daniels' Direct Use of the Sun\u2019s Energy. He began to experiment with practical methods, always seeking to simplify his approach as the experiments proceeded.  Steve Baer was a key organizer of an important grassroots Western-American conference, Alloy, focusing on these matters. Because the conference was spotlighted in the Whole Earth Catalog, Baer and Zomeworks became better known among solar enthusiasts in the U.S. Baer also was known as the author of Dome Cookbook and Zome Primer.[3]/nIn the early years at Zomeworks, Baer was able to work with other innovators and idea people, such as the solar designers Day Chahroudi, Dave Harrison, and Dick Henry. In 1975, Zomeworks published an illustrated book, Sunspots, written by Baer and illustrated by Criss-Cross; focusing on solar-design principles./nOne of Zomeworks' inventions was the now-expired patented Beadwall, which consists of two sheets of glass with small styrofoam beads blown in the space between them by an air pump at night to insulate the window areas of the building (the beads being removed by vacuum action in the morning). The design is somewhat similar to the drum wall./nBaer\u2019s approach has been to develop strategies and products that simplify rather than complicate; things that add to, rather than detract from, the self-sufficiency of a building and its occupants. The \"Track Rack\" solar tracker which Baer and Zomeworks staff developed is a metal-framed passive-solar dynamic mounting for photovoltaic (PV) modules. With an arrangement of cylinders, pistons, and tubing, the device uses the differential pressure and movement of entrapped liquid to enable gravity to turn the rack and follow the sun. Depending on heat and hydraulics, and without motors, gears, or computerized controls, the rack enables the PV module to face the sun (\"sunflower-wise\") for maximum efficiency. To fit into the developing solar energy industry, Zomeworks has designed and builds several Track Racks to fit all common photovoltaic modules./nAnother invention, the Skylight Tracker, has a dual purpose: it shades a skylight for indirect daytime lighting while making electricity from PV panels built into the shading slats./nBesides designing, testing, and fabricating solar-energy equipment, Baer and his company have provided consulting services to architects. Baer's design work was included in the Contemporary Developments in Design Science exhibit at St. John the Divine Cathedral, New York City, in 1995./nBaer's unconventional \"zome\" building-design approach, with its multi-faceted geometric lines, has been taken up by French builders in the Pyrenees.

Trained in mathematics, Borelli also made extensive studies of Jupiter's moons, the mechanics of animal locomotion and, in microscopy, of the constituents of blood. He also used microscopy to investigate the stomatal movement of plants, and undertook studies in medicine and geology. During his career, he enjoyed the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden. He was the first scientist to explain that animal and human bodily movements are caused by muscular contractions.[2]/nGiovanni Borelli was born on 28 January 1608 in the district of Castel Nuovo, in Naples.[3] He was the first-born son of Spanish infantryman Miguel Alfonso and a local woman named Laura Porello (alternately Porelli or Borelli.) Borelli had five siblings.[4]/nBorelli eventually traveled to Rome where he studied physics under Benedetto Castelli, matriculating in mathematics at Sapienza University of Rome.[4] From 1635 to 1656 he served as a Professor of Mathematics in Messina, Sicily. In 1635, the Senate of Messina offered him a membership in the prestigious Accademia della Fucina, which was an intellectual society of scientists devoted to studying and publishing largely on physical and natural sciences under the supervision and protection of the Senate. Borelli was designated to investigate \u201cthe causes of the malignant fever that lashed a large part of Italy in 1647. He attributed the cause to an airborne infection and contested the prevailing opinion that the illness was due to excessive heat, humidity, or astrological influences.\u201d[4] He even devised a treatment for the disease.[1] While Borelli worked on studying the disease he also continued to study mathematics. In 1658 he published a revised version of Euclid\u2019s Elements called, Euclides Restitutus (Euclid Restored). Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician whose book had been one of the most important mathematical texts for centuries. Borelli also revised Apollonius of Perga: Conics, a treatise on mathematics that examined parabolas and ellipses. Apollonius of Perga was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician.[2]/n/nAround 1655, Borelli was invited to the University of Pisa by Ferdinando De' Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany. During this time he was acquainted with astronomer Galileo Galilei.[4] While it is likely that they remained acquaintances, Galileo rejected considerations to nominate Borelli as head of Mathematics at the University of Pisa when he left the post himself. Borelli would attain this post in 1656. It was there that he first met the Italian anatomist Marcello Malpighi./nBorelli and Malpighi were both founder-members of the short-lived Accademia del Cimento, an Italian scientific academy founded in 1657. It was here that Borelli, piqued by Malpighi's own studies, began his first investigations into the science of animal movement, or biomechanics. This began an interest that would continue for the rest of his life, eventually earning him the title of the Father of Biomechanics. Borelli's involvement in the Accademia was temporary and the organization itself disbanded shortly after he left./nFrom 1664 to 1665, Borelli tracked the path of a comet. He took measurements of the comet and concluded that it was moving in an elliptical curved orbit around the sun. These conclusions went against the accepted scientific theory of the day (that was supported and imposed by the Catholic church), which asserted that Earth was the center of the universe. It was dangerous to oppose the theories of the church, so Borelli published his findings under the pseudonym Pier Maria Mutoli. In a treatise titled, Del Movimento della Cometa Apparasa il mese di Dicembre (Of the Movement of the Comet that Appears in the Month of December), Borelli suggested that planets and comets orbit the sun.[2]/nBorelli returned to Messina in 1668 in the midst of a political uprising that was growing against the Spanish in Italy. Borelli joined the anti-Spanish forces despite his familial ties to Spain through his father. He changed his surname from his father\u2019s name to a variation of his mother\u2019s name, likely to hide his ties to the Spanish.[2]/nIn 1674 Borelli was exiled from Messina to Rome[2] for suspected involvement in the political conspiracy to free Sicily from Spanish rule.[4] Here he first became acquainted with ex-Queen Christina of Sweden who had been forced to give up her crown and exiled to Rome two decades prior as a punishment for converting to Catholicism. In 1672 he served as her personal physician and scientific consultant.[1]/nBorelli lived the rest of his years in poverty, teaching basic mathematics at the school of the convent where he had been allowed to live. During the last years of his life, he worked on his most well-known publication De Motu Animalium (On the Movement of Animals), described as \u201ca rigidly mechanical, mathematical and physical analysis of various animal functions...[which] became the bible of the iatromathematical or iatromechanical school...\u201d.[5] The book attempted to clarify the cause of muscle fatigue, explain the cause of organ secretion, and explain the concept of pain.[1] Volume I was published in 1680, a few months after Borelli's death. Volume II of the book was published in 1681. Both volumes were dedicated to Christina of Sweden who financed the publication of the book with the help of benefactors from a convent.[4]/nBorelli died in Rome on December 31, 1679 of unknown causes.[2]/n[1] Adelmann HB.

This work originated with his studies of animals.  His publications, De Motu Animalium I and De Motu Animalium II, borrowing their title from the Aristotelian treatise, relate animals to machines and utilize mathematics to prove his theories.[6] The first volume covers biomechanical and muscular action in humans and animals (how muscles move while living beings walk, run, swim, jump, and fly). The second volume discusses the physiology of human organs, namely the lungs and heart.[4] In this volume he concluded that the heart contracted like other muscles, but unlike other muscles it was not attached to any limb. He noted that the purpose of cardiac contraction was to send blood throughout the body.[7]/nThe anatomists of the 17th century were the first to suggest the contractile movement of muscles.  Borelli, however, first suggested that 'muscles do not exercise vital movement otherwise than by contracting.'  He was also the first to deny corpuscular influence on the movements of muscles.  This was proven through his scientific experiments demonstrating that living muscles did not release corpuscles into the water when cut. Borelli also recognized that forward motion entailed the movement of a body's center of gravity forward, which was then followed by the swinging of its limbs in order to maintain balance.  His studies also extended beyond muscle and locomotion. In particular, he likened the action of the heart to that of a piston.  For this to work properly he derived the idea that the arteries have to be elastic. For these discoveries, Borelli is labeled as the father of modern biomechanics, and the American Society of Biomechanics uses the Borelli Award as its highest honor for research in the area.[8]/nAlong with his work on biomechanics, Borelli also had interests in physics, specifically the orbits of the planets.[9] Borelli believed that the planets were revolving as a result of three forces.  The first force involved the planets' desire to approach the sun.  The second force dictated that the planets were propelled to the side by impulses from sunlight, which is corporeal. Finally, the third force impelled the planets outward due to the sun's revolution.  The result of these forces is similar to a stone's orbit when tied on a string.  Borelli's measurements of the orbits of satellites of Jupiter are mentioned in Volume 3 of Newton's Principia./nBorelli is also considered to be the first person to consider a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus along with his early submarine design.[10][11] The exhaled gas was cooled by sea water after passing through copper tubing. The helmet was brass with a glass window and 0.6\u00a0m (2\u00a0ft) in diameter.

From 1872 to 1874, while he was still a student, he acted as an assistant to Karel Koristka. He submitted his habilitation thesis on practical geometry (geodesy) to the Technical University at Prague in 1876 and obtained the right to lecture. From 1875 to 1886 he taught at the Second German Realschule in Prague.

He then transferred to Stanford University in 1961, where he made fundamental contributions to the study of Brownian motion and laid the framework for the general mathematical theory of Markov chains. Chung would later be appointed Professor Emeritus of Mathematics of the Department of Mathematics at Stanford./nChung was regarded as one of the leading probabilists after World War II. He was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in 1958 in Edinburgh and in 1970 in Nice. Some of his most influential contributions have been in the form of his expositions in his textbooks on elementary probability and Markov chains. In addition, Chung also explored other branches of mathematics, such as probabilistic potential theory and gauge theorems for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation./nChung's visit to China in 1979 (together with Joseph L.

His classes were visited by Paul Erd\u0151s, who, as a first year student, solved one of his problems. K\u0151nig became a full professor there in 1935.[1] To honor his fathers' death in 1913, K\u0151nig and his brother Gy\u00f6rgy created the Gyula K\u0151nig prize in 1918.[1] This prize was meant to be an endowment for young mathematicians, however was later devaluated. But the prize remained as a medal of high scientific recognition. In 1899, he published his first work while still attending High School[1] in a journal Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok. After his graduation in 1902, he won first place in a mathematical competition \"E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd\".[1]  Shortly after he wrote the first of two book collections Matematikai Mulats\u00e1gok (Mathematical Entertainments). He spent four semesters at the university in Budapest and his last five in G\u00f6ttingen, during which he studied under the famous mathematicians J\u00f3zsef K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k and Hermann Minkowski. He then received his doctorate [1] in 1907 due to his dissertation in geometry, that same year he began working for the Technische Hochschule in Budapest and remained a part of the faculty till his death in 1944. At first he started as an assistant in problem sessions, in 1910 he was promoted to \"oberassistant\",[1] and then promoted to \"Privatdocent\" [1] in 1911 teaching nomography, analysis situs (later to be known as topology), set theory, real numbers and functions, and graph theory (the name \"graph theory\" didn't appear in the university catalogue until 1927). During this time he would be a guest speaker giving mathematics lecture for architecture and chemistry students, in 1920 these lectures made their way into book form.[1] at the Technische Hochschule./nFrom 1915 to 1942 he was on a committee to judge school contests in mathematics, collecting problems for these contests, and organizing them.[1] Then in 1933 he was elected as secretary of the society [1] and in 1942 he became the chairman of this committee.[1]  He then decided to make edits in the society's journal during his time on the committee till his death./nK\u0151nig's activities and lectures played a vital role in the growth of graph theoretical work of: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Egyed, Paul Erd\u0151s, Tibor Gallai, Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s, J\u00f3zsef Kraus, Tibor Szele, P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, Endre V\u00e1zsonyi, and many others.[1] He went on to write the first book on graph theory Theorie der endlichen und unendlichen Graphen in 1936.[1]  This marked the beginning of graph theory as its own branch of mathematics. Then in 1958, Claude Berge wrote the second book on graph theory, Th\u00e9orie des Graphes et ses applications,[1] following K\u0151nig./nAfter the occupation of Hungary by Nazi Germany, he worked to help persecuted mathematicians.

The Kirchhoff polynomial of G is a certain homogeneous polynomial whose degree is equal to the first betti number of G. These polynomials appear in the study of electrical circuits and in the evaluation of Feynman amplitudes. Motivated by work of D. Kreimer and D. J. Broadhurst associating multiple zeta values to certain Feynman integrals, Kontsevich conjectured that the number of zeros of a Kirchhoff polynomial over the field with q elements is always a polynomial function of q. We show that this conjecture is false by relating the schemes defined by Kirchhoff polynomials to the representation spaces of matroids. Moreover, using Mnev's universality theorem, we show that these schemes essentially generate all arithmetic of schemes of finite type over the integers.[4]/nBelkale works on enumerative algebraic geometry, quantum cohomology and moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves (conformal blocks and strange duality), and the Schubert calculus and its connections to intersection theory and representation theory.

Her father, Ludwig Geiringer, was born in Hungary and her mother, Martha Wertheimer, was from Vienna. Her parents had married while her father was working in Vienna as a textile manufacturer./nWhile still in high school, Geiringer showed great mathematical ability. Her parents supported her financially so that she could study mathematics at the University of Vienna. After receiving her first degree, Geiringer continued her study of mathematics in Vienna. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1917 under the guidance of Wilhelm Wirtinger with a thesis entitled \"Trigonometrische Doppelreihen\" about Fourier series in two variables. She spent the following two years as Leon Lichtenstein's assistant editing the Jahrbuch \u00fcber die Fortschritte der Mathematik, a mathematics review journal./nIn 1921, Geiringer moved to Berlin where she was employed as an assistant to Richard Edler von Mises at the Institute of Applied Mathematics. In this same year, she married Felix Pollaczek who, like Geiringer, was born in Vienna into a Jewish family and had studied in Berlin. Pollaczek obtained his doctorate in 1922 and went on to work for the Reichspost (Postal service) in Berlin, applying mathematical methods to telephone connections. Hilda and Felix had a child, Magda, in 1922, but their marriage broke up. After the divorce, Geiringer continued working for von Mises and at the same time raised her child./nAlthough trained as a pure mathematician, Geiringer moved towards applied mathematics to fit in with the work being undertaken at the Institute of Applied Mathematics. Her work at this time was on statistics, probability theory, and also on the mathematical theory of plasticity. She submitted a thesis for her Habilitation to qualify as an instructor at the University of Berlin, but it was not immediately accepted. Geiringer lost the right to teach at the university in December 1933.[1] In fact, she had been proposed for appointment to the position of extraordinary professor in 1933 but the proposal had been \u201dput on hold\u201d once the Civil Service Law came into effect two months after Adolf Hitler attained power. This law disqualified Jews from serving as teachers, professors, judges, or in other government positions. Geiringer left Germany after she was dismissed from the University of Berlin, and, with Magda, she went to Brussels. There she was appointed to the Institute of Mechanics and began to apply mathematics to the theory of vibrations./nIn 1934, Geiringer followed von Mises to Istanbul where she had been appointed as Professor of Mathematics and continued to research in applied mathematics, statistics, and probability theory. While in Turkey, Geiringer became intrigued with the basic principles of genetics formulated by the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel.[2] Between 1935 and 1939, she was preoccupied with uses for the theory of probability to which she and von Mises had made major, early contributions. Arguably Hilda Geiringer was one of the pioneers of what emerged as the burgeoning disciplines bearing such names as molecular genetics, human genetics, plant genetics, heredity in man, genomics, bioinformatics, biotechnology, biomedical engineering, and genetic engineering, among others. The world has not given sufficient credit to this intelligent woman's pioneering work mainly because it was done in Istanbul and published in Turkish journals. [a]/nFollowing Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s death in 1938, Geiringer and her daughter went to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania in the United States, where she was appointed to a lecturer position. In addition to her lecturing duties at Bryn Mawr College, Geiringer undertook, as part of the war effort, classified work for the United States National Research Council./nDuring 1942, she gave an advanced summer course in mechanics at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, with the aim of raising the American standards of education to the level that had been attained in Germany. She wrote up her outstanding series of lectures on the geometrical foundations of mechanics and, although they were never properly published, these were widely disseminated and used in the United States for many years. To this day, even though Brown University never offered Geiringer permanent employment, the university takes full birthplace credit for these \u201cmimeographed notes.\u201d[3][b]/nGeiringer and von Mises married in 1943 and, the following year, she left her part-time, low-pay lecturing post at Bryn Mawr College to be nearer to him and because the Wheaton College offered her her first permanent position in the USA. She accepted a post as Professor and Chairman of the Mathematics Department at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. During the week, she taught at the college, then traveled to Cambridge every weekend to be with von Mises./nFor many reasons, this was not a good arrangement. There were only two members of the mathematics faculty at Wheaton College and Geiringer longed for a situation where she was among mathematicians who were carrying out research./nGeiringer applied for positions at other New England universities, but these failed due to fairly open discrimination against women. Geiringer had another strike to overcome: she never disassociated herself from her Jewish upbringing. However, she took it all remarkably calmly, believing that if she could do something for future generations of women then she would have achieved something positive. She also never gave up her research while at Wheaton College. In 1953 she wrote:/nOne response to a job application she received was quite typical:/nOn 23 June 1939, Harvard University\u2019s astronomy professor Harlow Shapley wrote on her behalf to Radcliffe College which operated as Harvard\u2019s sister school. Though it drew instructors and other resources from Harvard, Radcliffe graduates were not granted Harvard degrees until 1963. Even though Geiringer was a better mathematician and a better teacher than Harvard could provide to the women at Radcliffe, Geiringer was never offered a real job by either./nIn a letter dated 7 March 1941, Oswald Veblen, writing in her behalf, stated: \"You know of course that there is more and more demand for knowledge of statistics in several sciences. It is very desirable that when possible the courses in statistics should be given by people who are well-grounded mathematically as well as interested in its applications. Teachers who satisfy both of these conditions are by no means common.\" He concluded that thought with \"Mrs. Geiringer is perhaps the only woman who satisfies both conditions.\" Three days later, Hermann Weyl wrote: \"In her field of applied mathematics, and especially in mathematical statistics, she is a first-rate scholar of great experience and accomplishment.\" He then added, \"in my opinion applied mathematics, which forms the bridge from abstract mathematics to the more concrete neighbor sciences, has up to now been unduly neglected in this country; that in the present circumstances its importance has increased considerably.\"[4]/nAs late as 28 May 1943 she wrote to Hermann Weyl at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. \u201cI am certainly conscious of the fact that it is hard for a refugee + woman to find something. Nevertheless I have not quite given up hope. I need not say that a research position would be just as welcome to me as teaching.\u201d[4] \u201cI hope there will be better conditions for the next generations of women,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn the meantime, one has to go on as well as possible.\u201d[5]/nIn 1953, Richard von Mises died and the following year Geiringer, although retaining her job at Wheaton College, began to work at Harvard, completing and editing many of von Mises\u2019 unfinished works, with the help von Mises' student Geoffrey S. S. Ludford. To do this, however, she had to secure a grant from the Office of Naval Research[6] and it was then that Harvard offered her a temporary position as a Research Fellow in Mathematics.

Demetrius is an American mathematician and theoretical biologist at the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary biology, Harvard University.[1] He is best known for the discovery of the concept evolutionary entropy,[2] a statistical parameter that characterizes Darwinian fitness in models of evolutionary processes at various levels of biological organization \u2013 molecular, organismic and social. Evolutionary entropy, a generalization of the Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy in statistical thermodynamics, is the cornerstone of directionality theory, an analytical study of evolution by variation and selection.[3][4][5][6] The theory has applications to: a) the development  of aging and the evolution of longevity;[7][8] b) the origin and progression of age related diseases  such as cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's  disease and Parkinson's disease;[9][10] c) the evolution of cooperation and the spread of inequality.[11]/nBorn in Jamaica, he carried out his undergraduate studies in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, UK. He received his PhD in mathematical biology from the University of Chicago in 1967. He was then a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley./nDemetrius was a faculty member in a number of mathematics departments in the US from 1969\u20131979: the University of California, Berkeley; Brown University; Rutgers University; and a research scientist at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G\u00f6ttingen (1980\u20131989) and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin. Since 1990, he has been with the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, first as a visiting professor (1990\u20131992), and then as an associate in population genetics. He has held visiting professorships at MIT, University of Paris, and was an occupant of a Chaire Municipale, a distinguished visiting professorship at the University of Grenoble. His research includes the application of ergodic theory and  the theory of  dynamical systems to the study of evolutionary processes in biological and socio-economic systems. He has also pioneered the application of the methodology of quantum mechanics to the study of allometric relations between metabolic rate and generation time in cells. This work is the  mathematical basis for the analysis of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders as metabolic and bioenergetic diseases./nThe primary achievements of Demetrius are the discovery of the concept Evolutionary Entropy, and the development of Directionality Theory, a study of the collective properties and evolutionary dynamics of aggregates of organic matter \u2013 macromolecules, cells, higher organisms  - on the basis of their microscopic structure.[2][3][5]/nDemetrius has shown that evolutionary entropy is related to the Thermodynamic Entropy of Ludwig Boltzmann and J.W. Gibbs, and Directionality Theory is the natural extension of Statistical Mechanics, the study of the collective behaviour of inorganic matter./nThe statistical parameter thermodynamic entropy, discovered by Boltzmann, describes the number of instantaneous microstates corresponding to a given macroscopic state. Evolutionary entropy is related to the multiplicity of trajectories characterizing the temporal progression of instantaneous microstates./nThermodynamic entropy describes the configuration of the instantaneous microstates, and ignores the effect of interparticle forces.  Evolutionary entropy describes the multiplicity of trajectories induced by interparticle forces and defined in terms of temporal progression of instantaneous microstates. The two statistical measures of cooperation are positively correlated when the number of microstates is large, effectively infinite./nStatistical mechanics, one of the pillars of modern Physics, is concerned with deducing the thermodynamic properties of aggregates of inanimate matter from its microstructure. The theory, which is based on the statistical measure thermodynamic entropy, is restricted to the study of collective behaviour in physical and chemical systems whose cooperativity can be effectively measured by Thermodynamic Entropy./nThe Directionality Theory of Demetrius pertains to organic matter.  It is a phenomelogical and analytic theory based on evolutionary entropy as a measure of the cooperativity between the entities that compose the microstructure. It is an extension of the methodology of statistical mechanics to the study of collective and evolutionary behaviour in biological systems./nA cornerstone of Directionality Theory is the Entropic Selection Principle. The changes in evolutionary entropy due to the process of variation and selection is determined by the resource endowment and the population size.[2][5]/nA corollary of the Entropic Selection Principle is the Fundamental Theorem of Evolution:[2][4]/nI a)   Evolutionary entropy increases when the resource endowment is scarce and constant/nI b)   Evolutionary entropy decreases when the resource endowment is abundant and inconstant./nDemetrius has exploited the Entropic Selection Principle to solve a long-standing problem at the interface of Physics and Biology. \nRudolf Clausius showed that the phenomenological fact: Heat flows spontaneously from hotter bodies to colder bodies \u2013 the Second Law of Thermodynamics \u2013 implies the existence of a property of matter which he called Entropy. \nThe major achievement of Boltzmann was the statistical mechanics rationale of the Second Law. Boltzmann\u2019s explanation was achieved by introducing the statistical parameter thermodynamic entropy, and relating this statistical measure of cooperativity with the Clausius entropy, a phenomenological construct. \nBoltzmann\u2019s explanation of the Second Law was based on the celebrated theorem of Statistical Mechanics:/nII) In isolated systems, that is systems which are closed to the input of energy and matter, thermodynamic entropy increases./nDemetrius has reconciled the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which pertains to energy transformation in inorganic matter, with the Fundamental Theorem of Evolution, which refers to energy transformation in organic matter.[2][5] This is achieved by establishing that the directionality principle for evolutionary entropy and the Second Law coincide when the resource production rate that drives the evolutionary system tends to zero, and the number of degrees of freedom of the evolutionary system tends to infinity.[2][5] This relation, Demetrius has shown, provides a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of life: the transition from an abiotic system, defined by inorganic matter \u2013 solids, liquids and gases \u2013, to the emergence of organized chemical assemblies capable of Darwinian evolution.[2]", "57557045": "David Gottlieb (November 14, 1944 \u2013 December 6, 2008) was an Israeli mathematician./nDavid Gottlieb was born in Tel Aviv.

Two of the sons, Benjamin and John, shared their father's interest in instruments and became watchmakers.[14]/nOughtred's wife was a niece of Simon Caryll of Tangley and his wife Lady Elizabeth Aungier (married 1607), daughter of Sir Francis Aungier. Oughtred was a witness to Simon Caryll's will, made 1618,[15][16] and through two further marriages Elizabeth remained matriarch and dowager of Great Tangley until her death in about 1650.[17][18] Elizabeth's brother Gerald, 2nd Baron Aungier of Longford, was married to Jane, daughter of Sir Edward Onslow of Knowle, Surrey in 1638. Oughtred praised Gerald (whom he taught) as a man of great piety and learning, skilled in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and other oriental languages.[19][20]/nIn January 1610 Sir George More, patron of Compton church adjacent to Loseley Park, granted the advowson (right of presentation of the minister) to Oughtred, when it should next fall vacant, though Oughtred was not thereby empowered to present himself to the living.[21] This was soon after Sir George More became reconciled to the marriage of his daughter Anne to the poet John Donne, which had occurred secretly in 1601./nOughtred was presented by Sir (Edward) Randall (lord of the manor) to the rectory of Albury, near Guildford in Surrey and instituted on 16 October 1610,[22] vacating Shalford on 18 January 1611.[23]/nIn January 1615/16 Sir George More re-granted the advowson of Compton church (still occupied) in trust to Roger Heath and Simon Caryll, to present Oughtred himself, or any other person whom Oughtred should nominate, when the vacancy should arise.[24] Soon afterwards Oughtred was approached by John Tichborne seeking his own nomination, and entering an agreement to pay him a sum of money upon certain days. Before this could be completed the incumbent died (November 1618), and Oughtred sought for himself to be presented, preaching several times at Compton, having the first fruits sequestered to his use, and, after four months, asking the patron to present him. However, Tichborne offered to complete the agreed payment at once, and was accordingly presented by the trustees in May 1619 (Simon Caryll dying in that year): but before he could be admitted, the Crown interposed a different candidate because the contract between Oughtred and Tichborne was deemed by Sir Henry Yelverton clearly to be Simoniacal.[21]/nOughtred therefore remained at Albury,[25] serving as rector there for fifty years.[26][27] William Lilly, that celebrated astrologer, knew Oughtred and claimed in his autobiography to have intervened on his behalf to prevent his ejection from his living by Parliament in 1646:/n\"About this time, the most famous mathematician of all Europe, Mr. William Oughtred, parson of Aldbury in Surry, was in danger of sequestration by the Committee of or for plundered ministers; (Ambo-dexters they were;)[28] several inconsiderable articles were deposed and sworn against him, material enough to have sequestered him, but that, upon his day of hearing, I applied myself to Sir Bolstrode Whitlock, and all my own old friends, who in such numbers appeared in his behalf, that though the chairman and many other Presbyterian members were stiff against him, yet he was cleared by the major number.\"[29]/nOf his portrait (aged 73, 1646) engraved by Wenceslas Hollar, prefixed to the Clavis Mathematica, John Evelyn remarked that it \"extreamly resembles him\", and that it showed \"that calm and placid Composure, which seemed to proceed from, and be the result of some happy \u1f15\u03c5\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 and Invention\".[30] William Oughtred died at Albury in 1660, a month after the restoration of Charles II. A staunch supporter of the royalty, he is said to have died of joy at the knowledge of the return of the King. He was buried in Old St Peter and St Paul's Church, Albury.[31] Autobiographical information is contained in his address \"To the English gentrie\" in his Just Apologie of c. 1634.[32]/nOughtred developed his interest in mathematics early in life, and devoted whatever spare time his academic studies allowed him to it. Among the short tracts added to the 1647/48 editions of the Clavis Mathematica was one describing a natural and easy way of delineating sun-dials upon any surface, however positioned, which the author states he invented in his 23rd year (1597/98), which is to say, during his fellowship at King's College, Cambridge. His early preoccupation was to find a portable instrument or dial by which to find the hour, he tried various contrivances, but never to his satisfaction. \"At last, considering that all manner of questions concerning the first motions were performed most properly by the Globe itself, rectified to the present elevation  by the help of a moveable Azimuth; he projected the Globe upon the plane of the Horizon, and applied to it at the center, which was therein the Zenith, an Index with projected degrees, for the moveable Azimuth.\"[2]/nThis projection answered his search, but then he had to invent theorems, problems and methods to calculate sections and intersections of large circles, which he could not find by instruments, not having access to any of sufficient size. In this way he drew out his findings, presenting one example to Bishop Thomas Bilson (who had ordained him), and another, in about 1606, to a certain noble lady, for whom he wrote notes for its use. In London, in spring 1618, Oughtred visited his friend Henry Briggs at Gresham College, and was introduced to Edmund Gunter, Reader in Astronomy, then occupying Dr Brooks's rooms. He showed Gunter his \"Horizontall Instrument\", who questioned him closely about it and spoke very approvingly. Soon afterwards Gunter sent him a print taken from a brass instrument made by Elias Allen, after Oughtred's written instructions (which Allen preserved).[2] When, in 1632, Richard Delamain the elder claimed that invention for himself,[33][34] William Robinson wrote to Oughtred: \"I cannot but wonder at the indiscretion of Rich. Delamain, who being conscious to himself that he is but the pickpurse of another man's wit, would thus inconsiderately provoke and awake a sleeping lion...\"[35]/nAround 1628 he was appointed by the Earl of Arundel to instruct his son William Howard in mathematics.[25] Some of Oughtred's mathematical correspondence survives, and is printed in Bayle's General Dictionary,[2] and (with some editorial omissions restored) in Dr Rigaud's Correspondence of Scientific Men.[36] William Alabaster wrote to him in 1633 to propose the quadrature of the circle by consideration of the fourth chapter of the Book of Ezekiel.[37] In 1634 he corresponded with the French architect Fran\u00e7ois Derand, and (among others) with Sir Charles Cavendish (1635), Johannes Banfi Hunyades (1637), William Gascoigne (1640)[38] and Dr John Twysden, M.D. (1650).[39]/nOughtred offered free mathematical tuition to pupils, among them Richard Delamain and Jonas Moore, and his teaching influenced a generation of mathematicians. Seth Ward resided with Oughtred for six months to learn contemporary mathematics, and the physician Charles Scarborough also stayed at Albury: John Wallis and Christopher Wren corresponded with him.[40] Another Albury pupil was Robert Wood, who helped him to see the Clavis through the press.[41] Isaac Newton's high opinion of Oughtred is expressed in his letter of 1694 to Nathaniel Hawes, where he quotes him extensively, calling him \"a Man whose judgement (if any man's) may safely be relyed upon... that very good and judicious man, Mr Oughtred\".[42]/nThe first edition of John Wallis's foundational text on infinitesimal calculus, Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656), carries a long letter of dedication to William Oughtred.[43]/nWilliam Oughtred's most important work was first published in 1631, in Latin, under the title Arithemetic\u00e6 in Numeris et Speciebus Institutio, quae tum Logistic\u00e6, tum Analytic\u00e6, atque adeus totius Mathematic\u00e6 quasi Clavis est (i.e. \"The Foundation of Arithmetic in Numbers and Kinds, which is as it were the Key of the Logistic, then of the Analytic, and so of the whole Mathematic(s)\"). It was dedicated to William Howard, son of Oughtred's patron Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel.[44]/nThis is a textbook on elementary algebra. It begins with a discussion of the Hindu-Arabic notation of decimal fractions and later introduces multiplication and division sign abbreviations of decimal fractions. Oughtred also discussed two ways to perform long division and introduced the \"~\" symbol, in terms of mathematics, expressing the difference between two variables. Clavis Mathematicae became a classic, reprinted in several editions. It was used as a textbook by John Wallis and Isaac Newton among others.  A concise work, it argued for a less verbose style in mathematics, and greater dependence on symbols. Drawing on Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te (though not explicitly), Oughtred also innovated freely with symbols, introducing not only the multiplication sign as now used universally,[45] but also the proportion sign (double colon\u00a0::).[46] The first edition, 1631, contained 20 chapters and 88 pages including algebra and various fundamentals of mathematics.[47]/nThe work was recast for the New Key, which appeared first in an English edition of 1647, The Key of the Mathematicks New Forged and Filed, dedicated to Sir Richard Onslow and to his son Arthur Onslow (son and grandson of Sir Edward), and then in a Latin edition of 1648, entitled Clavis Mathematica Denuo Limata, sive potius Fabricata (i.e. \"The Mathematical Key Newly Filed, or rather Made\"), in which the preface was removed and the book was reduced by one chapter. In the English Foreword, Oughtred explains that the intention had always been to provide the ingenious reader with an Ariadne's thread through the intricate labyrinth of these studies, but that his earlier, highly compressed style had been found difficult by some, and was now further elucidated.[48] These editions contained additional tracts on the resolution of adfected equations proposed in numbers, and other materials necessary for the use of decimal parts and logarithms, as well as his work on delineating sundials.[49]/nThe last lifetime edition (third) was in 1652, and posthumous editions (as Clavis Mathematic\u00e6: i.e. \"The Key of Mathematic(s)\") appeared in 1667 and 1693 (Latin), and in 1694 (English). The work gained popularity around 15 years after it first appeared, as mathematics took a greater role in higher education. Wallis wrote the introduction to his 1652 edition, and used it to publicise his skill as cryptographer;[50] in another, Oughtred promoted the talents of Wren./nThis work[51] was used by Oughtred in manuscript before it was edited for publication by his pupil, William Forster.[52] Here Oughtred introduced the abbreviations for trigonometric functions. It contains his description and instructions for the use of his important invention, the slide rule, a mechanical means of finding logarithmic results.[53]/nTwo of Oughtred's students, William Forster and Richard Delamaine the elder, are concerned with the story of this book.[55]  As instructor to the Earl of Arundel's son, Oughtred had the use of a room in Arundel House, the Earl's residence in the Strand, in London. He gave free instruction there to Richard Delamaine, whom he found to be too dependent on mathematical instruments to get a proper grasp of the theory behind them. Another student of his, Forster, who came to him as a beginner during the 1620s, was therefore taught without reference to instruments so that he should have a true grounding.[56] However, during the long vacation of 1630 Forster (who taught mathematics from a house in St Clement Danes churchyard, on the Westminster side of Temple Bar, in the same locality as Elias Allen's shop), while staying with Oughtred at Albury, asked him about Gunter's Ruler, and was shown two instruments used by his master, including Oughtred's circular slide rule.[57]/nOughtred then said to Forster:/n\"... the true way of Art is not by Instruments, but by Demonstration: and ... it is a preposterous course of vulgar Teachers, to begin with Instruments, and not with the Sciences, and so in-stead of Artists, to make their Schollers only doers of tricks, and as it were Iuglers: to the despite of Art, losse of precious time, and betraying of willing and industrious wits, unto ignorance, and idlenesse. ... the use of Instruments is indeed excellent, if a man be an Artist: but contemptible, being set and opposed to Art. And lastly, ... he meant to commend to me, the skill of Instruments, but first he would have me well instructed in the Sciences.\"[57]/nForster obtained Oughtred's permission to translate, edit and publish the description, explanations and instructions which Oughtred had in manuscript, finishing his work in 1632.[57] Meanwhile Delamaine, who had also been shown the instruments, and had copied a text sent by Oughtred to his instrument-maker Elias Allen, was writing-up his own description and account. Delamaine came off the press first, in two separate tracts,[58] claiming himself to be the inventor, and dedicating the prior treatise to King Charles I. He went so far as to show his page-proofs to Oughtred as they were being prepared, and dismissed his objections,[56] printing some derogatory comments aimed at Forster and Oughtred in his Foreword. Forster, who dedicated The Circles of Proportion to the famous intellectual Sir Kenelm Digby, observed that another person had hastily anticipated Oughtred's publication.[57] It was left to Oughtred himself to publish his Just Apologie explaining the priority of his inventions and writings, and showing the behaviour of Delamaine.[56][59]/nIt is stated in Cajori's book that John Napier was the first person ever to use to the decimal point and comma, but Bartholomaeus Pitiscus was really the first to do so.[60]/nTrigonometria, Hoc est, Modus Computandi Triangulorum Latera & Angulos was a collection compiled from Oughtred's papers by Richard Stokes and Arthur Haughton.[61] It contains about 36 pages of writing. Here the abbreviations for the trigonometric functions are explained in further detail consisting of mathematical tables.[8] It carries a frontispiece portrait of Oughtred similar to that by Wenceslas Hollar, but re-engraved by William Faithorne, and depicted as aged 83, and with a short epigram by \"R.S.\" beneath. Longer verses addressed to Oughtred are prefixed by Christopher Wase./nA miscellaneous collection of his hitherto unpublished mathematical papers (in Latin) was edited and published by his friend Sir Charles Scarborough in 1677.[62][63] The treatises contained are on these subjects:/nOughtred's invention of the slide rule consisted of taking a single \"rule\", already known to Gunter, and simplifying the method of employing it. Gunter required the use of a pair of dividers to lay off distances on his rule; Oughtred made the step of sliding two rules past each other to achieve the same ends.[64] His original design of some time in the 1620s was for a circular slide rule; but he was not the first into print with this idea, which was published by Delamain in 1630. The conventional design of a sliding middle section for a linear rule was an invention of the 1650s.[65]/nAt the age of 23, Oughtred invented the double horizontal sundial, now named the Oughtred type after him.[66] A short description The description and use of the double Horizontall Dyall (16 pp.) was added to a 1653 edition (in English translation) of the pioneer book on recreational mathematics, R\u00e9cr\u00e9ations Math\u00e9matiques (1624) by Hendrik van Etten, a pseudonym of Jean Leurechon.[67] The translation itself is no longer attributed to Oughtred, but (probably) to Francis Malthus.[68]/nOughtred also invented the Universal equinoctial ring dial.[69]/nAccording to his contemporaries, Oughtred had interests in alchemy and astrology.[70] The Hermetic science remained a philosophical touchstone among many reputable scientists of his time, and his student Thomas Henshaw copied a Diary and \"Practike\" given to him by his teacher.[71] He was well-acquainted with the astrologer William Lilly who, as noted above, helped to prevent his ejection from his living in 1646./nJohn Aubrey states that (despite their political differences) Sir Richard Onslow, son of Sir Edward, also defended Oughtred against ejection in 1646. He adds that Oughtred was an astrologer, and successful in the use of natal astrology, and used to say that he did not know why it should be effective, but believed that some \"genius\" or \"spirit\" assisted. According to Aubrey, Elias Ashmole possessed the original copy in Oughtred's handwriting of his rational division of the twelve houses of the zodiac. Oughtred penned an approving testimonial, dated 16 October 1659, to the foot of the English abstract of The Cabal of the Twelve Houses Astrological by \"Morinus\" (Jean-Baptiste Morin) which George Wharton inserted in his Almanac for 1659.[72]/nAubrey suggests that Oughtred was happy to allow the country people to believe that he was capable of conjuring. Aubrey himself had seen a copy of Christopher Cattan's work on Geomancy[73] annotated by Oughtred.[74] He reported that Oughtred had told Bishop Ward and Elias Ashmole that he had received sudden intuitions or solutions to problems when standing in particular places, or leaning against a particular oak or ash tree, \"as if infused by a divine genius\", after having pondered those problems unsuccessfully for months or years.[75]/nOughtred was well-known to Elias Ashmole, as Ashmole stated in a note to Lilly's autobiographical sketch: \"This gentleman I was very well acquainted with, having lived at the house over-against his, at Aldbury in Surrey, three or four years. E.A.\"[29]/nThe biography of Ashmole in the Biographia Britannica (1747)[76] called forth the supposition that Oughtred was a participant in Ashmole's admission to freemasonry in 1646. Friedrich Nicolai, in both sections of his Essay (on the Templar and Masonic Orders) of 1783, associated Oughtred, Lilly, Wharton and other Astrologers in the formation of the order of Free and Accepted Masons in Warrington and London.[77] The statement was reinforced through repetition by Thomas De Quincey,[78] and elaborated by Jean-Marie Ragon,[79] but was debunked in A.G. Mackey's History of Freemasonry (1906).[80]/nAshmole noted that he paid a visit to \"Mr. Oughtred, the famous mathematician\", on 15 September 1654, about three weeks after the Astrologers' Feast of that year.[81]/nOughtred expressed millenarian views to John Evelyn in 1655:/n\"Came that renowned mathematician, Mr. Oughtred, to see me, I sending my coach to bring him to Wotton, being now very aged. Among other discourse, he told me he thought water to be the philosopher's first matter, and that he was well persuaded of the possibility of their elixir; he believed the sun to be a material fire, the moon a continent, as appears by the late selenographers; he had strong apprehensions of some significant event to happen the following year, from the calculation of difference with the diluvian period; and added that it might possibly be to convert the Jews by our Saviour's visible appearance, or to judge the world; and therefore, his word was, Parate in occursum;[82] he said Original Sin was not met with in the Greek Fathers, yet he believed the thing; this was from some discourse on Dr. Taylor's late book, which I had lent him.\"[83]/nOughtred's name is remembered in the Oughtred Society, a group formed in the United States in 1991 for collectors of slide rules. It produces the twice-yearly Journal of the Oughtred Society and holds meetings and auctions for its members.[84][85]", "31834227": "Henry William Durant (1902\u20131982) was a noted opinion pollster and market researcher.

In August 1922 she published her paper 'On the use of very small pitot-tubes for measuring wind velocity' in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.[3] A pitot tube is a slender tube with two holes used to calculate speed through the air or water, used by both ships and aeroplanes. Barker was the first researcher to demonstrate that the difference between the pitot tube's reading and the static pressure is proportional to the flow speed rather than to its square.[1] In the same year she returned to the RAE, and became engaged to, and later married, the aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert, Principal Scientific Officer at the RAE./nAfter her husband was killed in an accident in 1934, Barker later became Examiner in Mathematics for the London and Cambridge and Joint Northern Universities.[4] In 1940 she published a final academic paper, which looked at the capture of raindrops by a cylinder and an aerofoil moving at uniform speed, a problem of ongoing concern due to ice formation, for example, on aeroplane wings in flight.[1]/nShe was married to Hermann Glauert, who died in 1934.

It proved that two different systems for set theory that had previously been proposed as foundational were equiconsistent: either both are valid or both lead to contradictions. These two systems were Zermelo set theory and Von Neumann set theory. They differed from each other in that von Neumann had added to Zermelo's theory a notion of classes, collections of mathematical objects that are defined by some property but do not necessarily form a set. (Often, intuitively, proper classes are \"too big\" to form sets; for instance, the collection of all sets cannot itself be a set, by Russell's paradox, but it can be a class.) Gaal's work showed that introducing this extra notion of a class is a safe step, one that does not introduce any new inconsistencies into the system.[1]/nGaal is also the author of two books:/nGaal was born in Vienna on January 17, 1924,[6] the daughter of a gynecologist and the sister of Gertrude M.

It is not certain when he lived; he may have lived any time between the 2nd century BC and the 2nd century AD. He wrote on mechanics, astronomy, and geometry. Proclus quotes from an Astronomical Treatise by Carpus concerning whether problems should come before theorems, in which Carpus may (or may not) have been criticising Geminus.[1] Proclus also quotes the view of Carpus that \"an angle is a quantity, namely a distance between the lines of surfaces containing it.\"[2] According to Pappus, Carpus made use of mathematics for practical applications.[3] According to Iamblichus, Carpus also constructed a curve for the purpose of squaring the circle, which he calls a curve generated by a double motion.[4]", "245933": "John Torrence Tate Jr. (March 13, 1925\u00a0\u2013 October 16, 2019) was an American mathematician distinguished for many fundamental contributions in algebraic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and related areas in algebraic geometry. He was awarded the Abel Prize in 2010./nTate was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His father, John Tate Sr., was a professor of physics at the University of Minnesota and a longtime editor of Physical Review. His mother, Lois Beatrice Fossler, was a high school English teacher. Tate Jr. received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1946 from Harvard University and entered the doctoral program in physics at Princeton University. He later transferred to the mathematics department and received his PhD in mathematics in 1950 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \"Fourier analysis in number fields and Hecke's zeta functions\" under the supervision of Emil Artin.[1] Tate taught at Harvard for 36 years before joining the University of Texas in 1990 as a Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair.[2] He retired from the Texas mathematics department in 2009 and returned to Harvard as a professor emeritus.[3]/nTate died at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts on October 16, 2019, at the age of 94.[4][5][6]/nTate's thesis (1950) on Fourier analysis in number fields has become one of the ingredients for the modern theory of automorphic forms and their L-functions, notably by its use of the adele ring, its self-duality and harmonic analysis on it; independently and a little earlier, Kenkichi Iwasawa obtained a similar theory. Together with his advisor Emil Artin, Tate gave a cohomological treatment of global class field theory using techniques of group cohomology applied to the idele class group and Galois cohomology.[7] This treatment made more transparent some of the algebraic structures in the previous approaches to class field theory, which used central division algebras to compute the Brauer group of a global field./nSubsequently, Tate introduced what are now known as Tate cohomology groups. In the decades following that discovery he extended the reach of Galois cohomology with the Poitou\u2013Tate duality, the Tate\u2013Shafarevich group, and relations with algebraic K-theory. With Jonathan Lubin, he recast local class field theory by the use of formal groups, creating the Lubin\u2013Tate local theory of complex multiplication./nHe has also made a number of individual and important contributions to p-adic theory; for example, Tate's invention of rigid analytic spaces can be said to have spawned the entire field of rigid analytic geometry. He found a p-adic analogue of Hodge theory, now called Hodge\u2013Tate theory, which has blossomed into another central technique of modern algebraic number theory.[7] Other innovations of his include the \"Tate curve\" parametrization for certain p-adic elliptic curves and the p-divisible (Tate\u2013Barsotti) groups./nMany of his results were not immediately published and some of them were written up by Serge Lang, Jean-Pierre Serre, Joseph H. Silverman and others. Tate and Serre collaborated on a paper on good reduction of abelian varieties. The classification of abelian varieties over finite fields was carried out by Taira Honda and Tate (the Honda\u2013Tate theorem).[8]/nThe Tate conjectures are the equivalent for \u00e9tale cohomology of the Hodge conjecture. They relate to the Galois action on the \u2113-adic cohomology of an algebraic variety, identifying a space of \"Tate cycles\" (the fixed cycles for a suitably Tate-twisted action) that conjecturally picks out the algebraic cycles. A special case of the conjectures, which are open in the general case, was involved in the proof of the Mordell conjecture by Gerd Faltings./nTate has also had a major influence on the development of number theory through his role as a Ph.D. advisor.

They proved that any two-dimensional map, with certain limitations, can be filled in with four colors without any adjacent \"countries\" sharing the same color./nAppel was born in Brooklyn, New York, on October 8, 1932. He grew up in Queens, New York, and was the son of a Jewish[2] couple, Irwin Appel and Lillian Sender Appel.

They had an invaluable tool that earlier mathematicians lacked\u2014modern computers. Their present proof rests in part on 1,200 hours of computer calculation during which about ten billion logical decisions had to be made. The proof of the four-color conjecture is unlikely to be of applied significance. Nevertheless, what has been accomplished is a major intellectual feat. It gives us an important new insight into the nature of two-dimensional space and of the ways in which such space can be broken into discrete portions.[3]/nAt first, many mathematicians were unhappy with the fact that Appel and Haken were using computers, since this was new at the time, and even Appel said, \"Most mathematicians, even as late as the 1970s, had no real interest in learning about computers. It was almost as if those of us who enjoyed playing with computers were doing something non-mathematical or suspect.\"[7] The actual proof was described in an article as long as a typical book titled Every Planar Map is Four Colorable, Contemporary Mathematics, vol. 98, American Mathematical Society, 1989.[4]/nThe proof has been one of the most controversial of modern mathematics because of its heavy dependence on computer number-crunching to sort through possibilities, which drew criticism from many in the mathematical community for its inelegance: \"a good mathematical proof is like a poem\u2014this is a telephone directory!\" Appel and Haken agreed in a 1977 interview that it was not \"elegant, concise, and completely comprehensible by a human mathematical mind\".[8]/nNevertheless, the proof was the start of a change in mathematicians' attitudes toward computers\u2014which they had largely disdained as a tool for engineers rather than for theoreticians\u2014leading to the creation of what is sometimes called experimental mathematics./nKenneth Appel's other publications include an article with P.E. Schupp titled Artin Groups and Infinite Coxeter Groups. In this article Appel and Schupp introduced four theorems that are true about Coxeter groups and then proved them to be true for Artin groups.

Then, the values of the function of the grids would have to be iteratively adjusted so that the discretised equation would be satisfied. At the time, digital computers did not exist, and the computations had to be done by hand. Southwell developed various techniques to speed up the calculations. For instance, in 1935, he used multiple grids for that purpose, a technique which would later be elaborated into the multigrid method.[9]/nSouthwell received the following honours and recognition for his achievements:/nSouthwell was also honoured with a knighthood.", "58835216": "Esther M.

She graduated from Temple University in 1942./nMeltzer was hired by the Moore School of Engineering after graduating to perform weather calculations, mainly because she knew how to operate an adding machine; in 1943, she was hired to perform calculations for ballistics trajectories.[2] At the time, this was accomplished by using manual desktop mechanical calculators. In 1945, she was selected to become one of the 6 original programmers of Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer./nMeltzer, alongside Kathleen Antonelli, Jean Jennings Bartik, Frances Elizabeth Holberton, Frances Spence and Ruth Teitelbaum, were the original six programmers of ENIAC,[3] a project that originally began in secret at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 1943.[4]/nENIAC was a huge machine full of black panels and switches, containing 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons, occupied 167m2 and consumed 150\u00a0kW of electricity.

He is credited as inventing the single transferable vote in 1819. His son, Rowland Hill, famous as the originator of the modern postal system, introduced STV in 1840 into the world's first public election, for the Adelaide City Council, in which the principle of proportional representation was applied./nIn 1791, Thomas Wright Hill courageously tried to save the apparatus of Dr Joseph Priestley from a mob in the Birmingham 'Church and King' riots of 1791\u2014the offer was declined./nHe was interested in astronomy, being a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and in computers, as is shown by a letter of his to Charles Babbage, dated 23 March 1836, among the Babbage manuscripts at the British Library, returning some logarithm tables that he had borrowed and adding \"How happy I shall be when I can see such a work verified and enlarged by your divine machine\"./nHill was the sixth child of James Hill, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, a baker and dealer in corn for horses, and his second wife, Sarah, daughter of John Symonds, of Kidderminster, who was in business as an apothecary and drysalter.[1] The Hill family had been freeholders and tradesmen for the past three generations, descendants of Walter Hill (d. 1693), a \"considerable landowner\" of Abberley, Worcestershire (although the Dictionary of National Biography gives him the name Walter and places him at Abberley, per Hill's own recollection, this man -- whose first name he did not specify -- was of \"the neighbourhood of Cleobury Mortimer\", Shropshire). Favouring the issue of his second marriage, the children of the first marriage were left to fend for themselves. One son, also Walter Hill, settled at Kidderminster, entering business as a hatter; Walter's son John, also of Kidderminster, a tailor, was father of James Hill. Hill believed his family to be related to the poet and satirist Samuel Butler.[2][3][4]/nHill started work as a brassfounder, but was more interested in intellectual pursuits, so in 1802 he bought a boys' school on Lionel Street, Birmingham moving it to Hill Top, Gough Street.  In 1819, it moved again to a new purpose-built school designed by Rowland at Hazelbrook called Hazelwood on Hagley Road in Edgbaston.[5]/nFrom the start the school seems to have been out of the ordinary.  In its original prospectus Hill says that \"he will make it his study to excite [his pupils'] reasoning powers, and to induce in them habits of voluntary application ... he will always endeavour, by kindness and patience, to secure for himself their affection and esteem\"; perhaps not revolutionary aims nowadays, but this was more than 25 years before Thomas Arnold became headmaster of Rugby or Charles Dickens wrote Nicholas Nickleby.  It is also noteworthy that he was offering \"instruction in art and science\"./nAt Hazelwood School, with his sons now bearing a full share in its running, it became a school in which the rules were formed by a committee of the boys, elected by the boys, and enforced by the boys' own law court.  Whether or not that is a good way to run a school, the amazing thing is that it existed at all at that time./nIn 1827 a London branch of the school was opened at Bruce Castle, Tottenham, and within a few years all the Hazelwood students had transferred to Bruce Castle, which had been taken over almost entirely by his sons. Hazelwood then became the home of Francis Clark and his wife Caroline (daughter of Thomas Wright Hill) and their large and growing family. They remained there for fifteen years before emigrating to South Australia.[6]/nThomas Hill and his sons had strong political views which, at that time, were certainly radical, but always with the conviction that reforms had to come by persuasion, and constitutionally, not by violence.  During the agitation leading up to the Great Reform Act of 1832, the fifth son Frederic Hill was freed from duties at the school to devote his time to an active part in the struggle as part of the Birmingham Union.  A letter to his son Edwin, dated 15 May 1832, says \"These my dear boy are stirring times ... the enthusiasm and unanimity of the mass who form the Birmingham Union is at once delightful and astonishing.  I hope that it will be kept quite within the law.  Let the honour of a vigour surmounting that boundary belong to our adversaries; they will not find such forbearance as they may have met with in days past\".  As his contribution to the cause \"I am abstaining from tea, coffee, sugar etc., as taxed articles.  Would that the massive unions would concur.  The revenue then would soon require parliamentary help, and funds would be reserved for useful purposes.  But this kind of passive procedure is too much to hope for as a general procedure\"./nHe does not seem to have disapproved of a little political trickery, provided the right side was doing it.  Writing to his wife, dated 11 May 1831, about the \"patriotic fellows of Haddington\" including her brother, he says \"Their district has five boroughs which choose a member of parliament by one [delegate] from each borough.  Haddington was firm and Jedburgh was firm in the good cause.  Dunbar was Rotten and the same was North Berwick.  Lauder had seven good men in the council out of sixteen.  By excellent management the men of Haddington brought away two councilmen from Lauder and entertained them until the business was accomplished, so that now three delegates out of the five are sound reformers ... It is a glorious victory and a proud thing for us to have so near a relative bearing such a part in it\"./nIn spite of radical views, he evidently thought well of King George III, for in a letter dated 9 February 1820, just after George IV's accession, he wrote to his son Matthew \"How did your taste accord with bell-ringing and huzzas at the King's proclamation?  To me, connected as it was with the death of our late aged and virtuous monarch it was revolting, even to hear of; I saw nothing of the pageantry\"./nIn 1819, Thomas and Rowland were instrumental in founding the Society for Literary and Scientific Improvement of Birmingham. The Society's bylaws include a description of Hill's method of proportional representation, the earliest known version[7] of the single transferable vote:/nAccording to Hill's great-great-great grandson David Hill (also a reform activist) the first STV election actually took place on 18 December 1819 one month after the establishment of the society.[9][citation needed]/nHill's grandson (and Rowland's nephew) George Birkbeck Norman Hill wrote, \"The plan of election had been devised by his [Rowland's] father who \u2026 was strongly in favour of the representation of minorities.\"[10]/nIn 1821, Hill used an informal version of proportional representation in his school./nAlthough this seems likely to be true, when Enid Lakeman was asked for the source of it she could not remember it.

Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, G\u00f6del had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell,[3] Alfred North Whitehead,[3] and David Hilbert were using logic and set theory to investigate the foundations of mathematics, building on earlier work by the likes of Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor and Gottlob Frege./nG\u00f6del's discoveries in the foundations of mathematics led to the proof of his completeness theorem in 1929 as part of his dissertation to earn a doctorate at the University of Vienna, and the publication of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems two years later, in 1931. The first incompleteness theorem states that for any \u03c9-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (for example, Peano arithmetic), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms.[4] To prove this, G\u00f6del developed a technique now known as G\u00f6del numbering, which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. The second incompleteness theorem, which follows from the first, states that the system cannot prove its own consistency.[5]/nG\u00f6del also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, assuming that its axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and modal logic./nG\u00f6del was born April 28, 1906, in Br\u00fcnn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic), into the German-speaking family of Rudolf G\u00f6del (1874\u20131929), the managing director and part owner of a major textile firm, and Marianne G\u00f6del (n\u00e9e Handschuh, 1879\u20131966).[6] At the time of his birth the city had a German-speaking majority which included his parents.[7] His father was Catholic and his mother was Protestant and the children were raised as Protestants. The ancestors of Kurt G\u00f6del were often active in Br\u00fcnn's cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph G\u00f6del was a famous singer in his time and for some years a member of the Br\u00fcnner M\u00e4nnergesangverein (Men's Choral Union of Br\u00fcnn).[8]/nG\u00f6del automatically became a citizen of Czechoslovakia at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed following its defeat in the First World War. According to his classmate Klepeta\u0159, like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenl\u00e4nder, \"G\u00f6del considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia\".[9] In February 1929, he was granted release from his Czechoslovakian citizenship and then, in April, granted Austrian citizenship.[10] When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, G\u00f6del automatically became a German citizen at age 32. In 1948, after World War II, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen.[11]/nIn his family, the young G\u00f6del was nicknamed Herr Warum (\"Mr. Why\") because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven, Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever; he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, G\u00f6del suffered from \"frequent episodes of poor health\", which would continue for his entire life.[12]/nG\u00f6del attended the Evangelische Volksschule, a Lutheran school in Br\u00fcnn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although G\u00f6del had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf (born 1902) left for Vienna, where he attended medical school at the University of Vienna. During his teens, G\u00f6del studied Gabelsberger shorthand, Goethe's Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton, and the writings of Immanuel Kant.[citation needed]/nAt the age of 18, G\u00f6del joined his brother at the University of Vienna. By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics.[13] Although initially intending to study theoretical physics, he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy.[14] During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism. He read Kant's Metaphysische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Naturwissenschaft, and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap. G\u00f6del then studied number theory, but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell's book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, he became interested in mathematical logic. According to G\u00f6del, mathematical logic was \"a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences.\"[15]/nAttending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency in mathematical systems may have set G\u00f6del's life course. In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published Grundz\u00fcge der theoretischen Logik (Principles of Mathematical Logic), an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed: \"Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system?\"/nThis problem became the topic that G\u00f6del chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established his eponymous completeness theorem regarding the first-order predicate calculus. He was awarded his doctorate in 1930, and his thesis (accompanied by some additional work) was published by the Vienna Academy of Science./nKurt G\u00f6del's achievement in modern logic is singular and monumental\u2014indeed it is more than a monument, it is a landmark which will remain visible far in space and time. ... The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with G\u00f6del's achievement./nIn 1930 G\u00f6del attended the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences, held in K\u00f6nigsberg, 5\u20137 September. Here he delivered his incompleteness theorems.[17]/nG\u00f6del published his incompleteness theorems in \u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme (called in English \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems\"). In that article, he proved for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers (e.g., the Peano axioms or Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice), that:/nThese theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Gottlob Frege and culminating in Principia Mathematica and Hilbert's Program, to find a non-relatively consistent axiomatization sufficient for number theory (that was to serve as the foundation for other fields of mathematics)./nIn hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. G\u00f6del essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false.\nThus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement.\nThat is, for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic (that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources), there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system.\nTo make this precise, however, G\u00f6del needed to produce a method to encode (as natural numbers) statements, proofs, and the concept of provability; he did this using a process known as G\u00f6del numbering./nIn his two-page paper Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalk\u00fcl (1932) G\u00f6del refuted the finite-valuedness of intuitionistic logic. In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett intermediate logic (or G\u00f6del fuzzy logic)./nG\u00f6del earned his habilitation at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians. In June 1936, Moritz Schlick, whose seminar had aroused G\u00f6del's interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, Johann Nelb\u00f6ck. This triggered \"a severe nervous crisis\" in G\u00f6del.[18] He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases.[19]/nIn 1933, G\u00f6del first traveled to the U.S., where he met Albert Einstein, who became a good friend.[20] He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society. During this year, G\u00f6del also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using G\u00f6del numbering./nIn 1934, G\u00f6del gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, titled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems. Stephen Kleene, who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published./nG\u00f6del visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The travelling and the hard work had exhausted him and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis; he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory./nHe married Adele Nimbursky\u00a0[es ;  ast] (n\u00e9e Porkert, 1899\u20131981), whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938. G\u00f6del's parents had opposed their relationship because she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was./nSubsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory,[21] a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe, a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. G\u00f6del showed that both the axiom of choice (AC) and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms for set theory (ZF). This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false; together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory./nG\u00f6del spent the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame.[22]/nAfter the Anschluss on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany.\nGermany abolished the title Privatdozent, so G\u00f6del had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down./nHis predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939.\nBefore the year was up, G\u00f6del and his wife left Vienna for Princeton. To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the G\u00f6dels took the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco (which they reached on March 4, 1940), then crossed the US by train to Princeton. There G\u00f6del accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), which he had previously visited during 1933\u201334.[23]/nAlbert Einstein was also living at Princeton during this time. G\u00f6del and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his \"own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with G\u00f6del\".[24]/nG\u00f6del and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in Blue Hill, Maine, at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. G\u00f6del was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using Heft 15 [volume 15] of G\u00f6del's still-unpublished Arbeitshefte [working notebooks], John W. Dawson Jr. conjectures that G\u00f6del discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. G\u00f6del's close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture, noting that G\u00f6del's Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem./nOn December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied G\u00f6del to his U.S. citizenship exam, where they acted as witnesses. G\u00f6del had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship; this has since been dubbed G\u00f6del's Loophole. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be Phillip Forman, who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask G\u00f6del if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. G\u00f6del then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut G\u00f6del off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.[25][26]/nG\u00f6del became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976.[27]/nDuring his time at the institute, G\u00f6del's interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving closed timelike curves, to Einstein's field equations in general relativity.[28] He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday.[29] His \"rotating universes\" would allow time travel to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the G\u00f6del metric (an exact solution of the Einstein field equation)./nHe studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz, but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibniz's works to be suppressed.[30] To a lesser extent he studied Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl. In the early 1970s, G\u00f6del circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibniz's version of Anselm of Canterbury's ontological proof of God's existence. This is now known as G\u00f6del's ontological proof./nG\u00f6del was awarded (with Julian Schwinger) the first Albert Einstein Award in 1951, and was also awarded the National Medal of Science, in 1974.[31] G\u00f6del was elected a resident member of the American Philosophical Society in 1961 and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1968.[32][1] He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[33]/nLater in his life, G\u00f6del suffered periods of mental instability and illness. Following the assassination of his close friend Moritz Schlick,[34] G\u00f6del developed an obsessive fear of being poisoned, and would eat only food prepared by his wife Adele. Adele was hospitalized beginning in late 1977, and in her absence G\u00f6del refused to eat;[35] he weighed 29 kilograms (65\u00a0lb) when he died of \"malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance\" in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978.[36] He was buried in Princeton Cemetery. Adele died in 1981.[37]/nG\u00f6del believed that God[38] was personal, and called his philosophy \"rationalistic, idealistic, optimistic, and theological\".[39]/nG\u00f6del believed in an afterlife, saying, \"Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which today's science and received wisdom haven't any inkling of. But I am convinced of this [the afterlife], independently of any theology.\" It is \"possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning\" that it \"is entirely consistent with known facts.\" \"If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing [as an afterlife].\"[40]/nIn an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, G\u00f6del described his religion as \"baptized Lutheran (but not member of any religious congregation). My belief is theistic, not pantheistic, following Leibniz rather than Spinoza.\"[41] Of religion(s) in general, he said: \"Religions are, for the most part, bad\u2014but religion is not\".[42] According to his wife Adele, \"G\u00f6del, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning\",[43] while of Islam, he said, \"I like Islam: it is a consistent [or consequential] idea of religion and open-minded.\"[44]/nDouglas Hofstadter wrote the 1979 book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach to celebrate the work and ideas of G\u00f6del, M. C. Escher and Johann Sebastian Bach. It partly explores the ramifications of the fact that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem can be applied to any Turing-complete computational system, which may include the human brain./nThe Kurt G\u00f6del Society, founded in 1987, is an international organization for the promotion of research in logic, philosophy, and the history of mathematics.

A Protestant convert, he was a victim of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre./nHe was born at the village of Cuts, Picardy; his father was a farmer. He gained admission at age twelve (thus about 1527) to the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre, working as a servant. A reaction against scholasticism was in full tide, at a transitional time for Aristotelianism. On the occasion of receiving his M.A. degree in 1536, Ramus allegedly took as his thesis Quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse (Everything that Aristotle has said is false), which Walter J. Ong paraphrases as follows:/nAll the things that Aristotle has said are inconsistent because they are poorly systematized and can be called to mind only by the use of arbitrary mnemonic devices.[2]/nAccording to Ong[3] this kind of spectacular thesis was in fact routine at the time. Even so, Ong raises questions as to whether Ramus actually ever delivered this thesis.[4]/nRamus, as graduate of the university, started courses of lectures. At this period he was engaged in numerous separate controversies. One opponent in 1543 was the Benedictine Joachim P\u00e9rion\u00a0[fr].[5] He was accused, by Jacques Charpentier, professor of medicine, of undermining the foundations of philosophy and religion. Arnaud d'Ossat, a pupil and friend of Ramus, defended him against Charpentier.[6] Ramus was made to debate Goveanus (Antonio de Gouveia), over two days.[7] The matter was brought before the parlement of Paris, and finally before Francis I. By him it was referred to a commission of five, who found Ramus guilty of having \"acted rashly, arrogantly and impudently,\" and interdicted his lectures (1544)./nHe withdrew from Paris, but soon afterwards returned, the decree against him being canceled by Henry II, who came to the throne in 1547, through the influence of Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. He obtained a position at the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre.[8][9]/nIn 1551 Henry II appointed him a regius professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, but at his request he was given the unique and at the time controversial title of Professor of Philosophy and eloquence.[10] For a considerable time he lectured before audiences numbering as many as 2,000. Pierre Galland\u00a0[fr], another professor there, published Contra novam academiam Petri Rami oratio (1551), and called him a \"parricide\" for his attitude to Aristotle. The more serious charge was that he was a nouveau academicien, in other words a sceptic. Audomarus Talaeus (Omer Talon c.1510\u20131581), a close ally of Ramus, had indeed published a work in 1548 derived from Cicero's description of Academic scepticism, the school of Arcesilaus and Carneades.[11][12]/nIn 1561 he faced significant enmity following his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from Paris; and, though he found asylum in the palace of Fontainebleau, his house was pillaged and his library burned in his absence. He resumed his chair after this for a time, but he was summoned on 30 June 1568 before the King's Attorney General to be heard with Simon Baudichon and other professors:[13] the position of affairs was again so threatening that he found it advisable to ask permission to travel./nHe spent around two years, in Germany and Switzerland.[14] The La Rochelle Confession of Faith earned his disapproval, in 1571, rupturing his relationship with Theodore Beza and leading Ramus to write angrily to Heinrich Bullinger.[15]/nReturning to France, he fell a victim in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572). Hiding for a while in a bookshop off the Rue St Jacques, he returned to his lodgings, on 26 August, the third day of the violence. There he was stabbed while at prayer.[16] Suspicions against Charpentier have been voiced ever since.[17] His death was compared by one of his first biographers, his friend and colleague Nicolas de Nancel\u00a0[fr], to the murder of Cicero.[18]/nA central issue is that Ramus's anti-Aristotelianism arose out of a concern for pedagogy. Aristotelian philosophy, in its Early Modern form as scholasticism showing its age, was in a confused and disordered state. Ramus sought to infuse order and simplicity into philosophical and scholastic education by reinvigorating a sense of dialectic as the overriding logical and methodological basis for the various disciplines./nHe published in 1543 the Aristotelicae Animadversiones and Dialecticae Partitiones, the former a criticism on the old logic and the latter a new textbook of the science. What are substantially fresh editions of the Partitiones appeared in 1547 as Institutiones Dialecticae, and in 1548 as Scholae Dialecticae; his Dialectique (1555), a French version of his system, is the earliest work on the subject in the French language./nIn the Dialecticae partitiones Ramus recommends the use of summaries, headings, citations and examples. Ong calls Ramus's use of outlines, \"a reorganization of the whole of knowledge and indeed of the whole human lifeworld.\"[19]/nAfter studying Ramus's work, Ong concluded that the results of his \"methodizing\" of the arts \"are the amateurish works of a desperate man who is not a thinker but merely an erudite pedagogue\".[20] On the other hand, his work had an immediate impact on the issue of disciplinary boundaries, where educators largely accepted his arguments, by the end of the century.[21]/nThe logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time, and there existed a school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. It cannot be said, however, that Ramus's innovations mark any epoch in the history of logic, and there is little ground for his claim to supersede Aristotle by an independent system of logic. The distinction between natural and artificial logic, i.e., between the implicit logic of daily speech and the same logic made explicit in a system, passed over into the logical handbooks./nHe amends the syllogism. He admits only the first three figures, as in the original Aristotelian scheme, and in his later works he also attacks the validity of the third figure, following in this the precedent of Laurentius Valla. Ramus also set the modern fashion of deducing the figures from the position of the middle term in the premises, instead of basing them, as Aristotle does, upon the different relation of the middle to the major term and minor term./nAs James Jasinski explains, \"the range of rhetoric began to be narrowed during the 16th century, thanks in part to the works of Peter Ramus.\"[22] In using the word \"narrowed,\" Jasinski is referring to Ramus's argument for divorcing rhetoric from dialectic (logic), a move that had far reaching implications for rhetorical studies and for popular conceptions of public persuasion. Contemporary rhetoricians have tended to reject Ramus's view in favor of a more wide ranging (and in many respects, Aristotelian) understanding of the rhetorical arts as encompassing \"a [broad] range of ordinary language practices.\"[23] Rhetoric, traditionally, had had five parts, of which inventio (invention) was the first. Ramus insisted on rhetoric to be studied alongside dialectic through two main manuals: invention and judgement under the dialectic manual, and style and delivery in the rhetoric manual. Memory, one of the five skills of traditional rhetoric, was regarded by Ramus as being part of psychology, as opposed to being part of rhetoric, and thus dispensed from his idea of rhetoric and dialectic.[24] Brian Vickers said that the Ramist influence here did add to rhetoric: it concentrated more on the remaining aspect of elocutio or effective use of language, and emphasised the role of vernacular European languages (rather than Latin). Ramist reforms strengthened the rhetoricians' tendency to focus on style.[25] The effect was that rhetoric was applied in literature.[26]/nInvention involves fourteen topics, including definition, cause, effect, subject, adjunct, difference, contrary, comparison, similarity, and testimony. Style encompasses four tropes: metaphor, synecdoche, metonymy, and irony. It also includes rules for poetic meter and rhythmical prose, figures corresponding to attitudes a speaker may take, and of repetition. Delivery covers the use of voice and gestures.[27]/nHis rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of logic as the ars disserendi; he maintains that the rules of logic may be better learned from observation of the way in which Cicero persuaded his hearers than from a study of Aristotle's works on logic (the Organon)./nLogic falls, according to Ramus, into two parts: invention (treating of the notion and definition) and judgment (comprising the judgment proper, syllogism and method). Here he was influenced by Rodolphus Agricola.[28] This division gave rise to the jocular designation of judgment or mother-wit as the \"secunda Petri\". But what Ramus does here in fact redefines rhetoric. There is a new configuration, with logic and rhetoric each having two parts: rhetoric was to cover elocutio and pronuntiatio. In general, Ramism liked to deal with binary trees as method for organising knowledge.[29]/nHe was also known as a mathematician, a student of Johannes Sturm. It has been suggested that Sturm was an influence in another way, by his lectures given in 1529 on Hermogenes of Tarsus: the Ramist method of dichotomy is to be found in Hermogenes.[30]/nHe had students of his own.[31] He corresponded with John Dee on mathematics, and at one point recommended to Elizabeth I that she appoint him to a university chair.[32]/nThe views of Ramus on mathematics implied a limitation to the practical: he considered Euclid's theory on irrational numbers to be useless.[33] The emphasis on technological applications and engineering mathematics was coupled to an appeal to nationalism (France was well behind Italy, and needed to catch up with Germany).[34]/nThe teachings of Ramus had a broadly based reception well into the seventeenth century. Later movements, such as Baconianism, pansophism, and Cartesianism, in different ways built on Ramism, and took advantage of the space cleared by some of the simplifications (and oversimplifications) it had effected. The longest-lasting strand of Ramism was in systematic Calvinist theology, where textbook treatments with a Ramist framework were still used into the eighteenth century, particularly in New England./nThe first writings on Ramism, after the death of Ramus, included biographies, and were by disciples of sorts: Freigius (1574 or 1575),[35] Banosius (1576),[36] Nancelius\u00a0[fr] (1599), of whom only Nancelius was closely acquainted with the man.[37] Followers of Ramus in different fields included Johannes Althusius, Caspar Olevianus, John Milton, Johannes Piscator, Rudolph Snellius and Hieronymus Treutler.[38]/nHe published fifty works in his lifetime and nine appeared after his death.

Lebesgue's father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher. His parents assembled at home a library that the young Henri was able to use. His father died of tuberculosis when Lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself. As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school, one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education at the Coll\u00e8ge de Beauvais and then at Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis and Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris.[5]/nIn 1894 Lebesgue was accepted at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics, graduating in 1897. After graduation he remained at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure for two years, working in the library, where he became aware of the research on discontinuity done at that time by Ren\u00e9-Louis Baire, a recent graduate of the school. At the same time he started his graduate studies at the Sorbonne, where he learned about \u00c9mile Borel's work on the incipient measure theory and Camille Jordan's work on the Jordan measure. In 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the Lyc\u00e9e Central in Nancy, while continuing work on his doctorate. In 1902 he earned his PhD from the Sorbonne with the seminal thesis on \"Integral, Length, Area\", submitted with Borel, four years older, as advisor.[6]/nLebesgue married the sister of one of his fellow students, and he and his wife had two children, Suzanne and Jacques./nAfter publishing his thesis, Lebesgue was offered in 1902 a position at the University of Rennes, lecturing there until 1906, when he moved to the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Poitiers.

In 1921 he left the Sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life.[7] In 1922 he was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. Henri Lebesgue died on 26 July 1941 in Paris.[6]/nLebesgue's first paper was published in 1898 and was titled \"Sur l'approximation des fonctions\". It dealt with Weierstrass's theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials. Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes in Comptes Rendus. The first of these, unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration, dealt with the extension of Baire's theorem to functions of two variables. The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane, the area of skew polygons, surface integrals of minimum area with a given bound, and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some function f(x). Lebesgue's great thesis, Int\u00e9grale, longueur, aire, with the full account of this work, appeared in the Annali di Matematica in 1902. The first chapter develops the theory of measure (see Borel measure). In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically. The next chapters expand the Comptes Rendus notes dealing with length, area and applicable surfaces. The final chapter deals mainly with Plateau's problem. This dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician.[1]/nHis lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a \"Borel tract\" Le\u00e7ons sur l'int\u00e9gration et la recherche des fonctions primitives. The problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book. Lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context, addressing Augustin-Louis Cauchy, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, and Bernhard Riemann. Lebesgue presents six conditions which it is desirable that the integral should satisfy, the last of which is \"If the sequence fn(x) increases to the limit f(x), the integral of fn(x) tends to the integral of f(x).\" Lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable functions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral./nHe turned next to trigonometric functions with his 1903 paper \"Sur les s\u00e9ries trigonom\u00e9triques\". He presented three major theorems in this work: that a trigonometrical series\nrepresenting a bounded function is a Fourier series, that the nth Fourier coefficient tends to zero (the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma), and that a Fourier series is integrable term by term. In 1904-1905 Lebesgue lectured once again at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, this time on trigonometrical series and he went on to publish his lectures in another of the \"Borel tracts\". In this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context. He expounds on Fourier series, Cantor-Riemann theory, the Poisson integral and the Dirichlet problem./nIn a 1910 paper, \"Repr\u00e9sentation trigonom\u00e9trique approch\u00e9e des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de Lipschitz\" deals with the Fourier series of functions satisfying a Lipschitz condition, with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term. He also proves that the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma is a best possible result for continuous functions, and gives some treatment to Lebesgue constants./nLebesgue once wrote, \"R\u00e9duites \u00e0 des th\u00e9ories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, les math\u00e9matiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu.\" (\"Reduced to general theories, mathematics would be a beautiful form without content.\")/nIn measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics, the Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral generalizes Riemann\u2013Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration, preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure-theoretic framework./nDuring the course of his career, Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex analysis and topology. He also had a disagreement with \u00c9mile Borel about whose integral was more general.[8][9][10][11] However, these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis; his contributions to this field had a tremendous impact on the shape of the field today and his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis. These have important practical implications for fundamental physics of which Lebesgue would have been completely unaware, as noted below./nIntegration is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the area under the graph of a function. The first theory of integration was developed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC with his method of quadratures, but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry. In the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to differentiation, the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph. This surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus, differentiation and integration, is now known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. It has allowed mathematicians to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time. However, unlike Archimedes' method, which was based on Euclidean geometry, mathematicians felt that Newton's and Leibniz's integral calculus did not have a rigorous foundation./nIn the 19th century, Augustin Cauchy developed epsilon-delta limits, and Bernhard Riemann followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the Riemann integral. To define this integral, one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller rectangles and takes the limit of the sums of the areas of the rectangles at each stage. For some functions, however, the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number. As such, they have no Riemann integral./nLebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem.\nInstead of using the areas of rectangles, which put the focus on the domain of the function, Lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area.\nLebesgue's idea was to first define measure, for both sets and functions on those sets. He then proceeded to build the integral for what he called simple functions; measurable functions that take only finitely many values.\nThen he defined it for more complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question./nLebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a Riemann integral also has a Lebesgue integral, and for those functions the two integrals agree. Furthermore, every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a Lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a Lebesgue integral that have no Riemann integral./nAs part of the development of Lebesgue integration, Lebesgue invented the concept of measure, which extends the idea of length from intervals to a very large class of sets, called measurable sets (so, more precisely, simple functions are functions that take a finite number of values, and each value is taken on a measurable set).\nLebesgue's technique for turning a measure into an integral generalises easily to many other situations, leading to the modern field of measure theory./nThe Lebesgue integral is deficient in one respect.\nThe Riemann integral generalises to the improper Riemann integral to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a closed interval.\nThe Lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions (always reproducing the same answer when it does), but not all of them.\nFor functions on the real line, the Henstock integral is an even more general notion of integral (based on Riemann's theory rather than Lebesgue's) that subsumes both Lebesgue integration and improper Riemann integration.\nHowever, the Henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the real line and so does not generalise to allow integration in more\ngeneral spaces (say, manifolds), while the Lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally.", "23642478": "Charles Bradfield Morrey Jr. (July 23, 1907 \u2013 April 29, 1984)[4] was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the calculus of variations and the theory of partial differential equations./nCharles Bradfield Morrey Jr. was born July 23, 1907, in Columbus, Ohio; his father was a professor of bacteriology at Ohio State University, and his mother was president of a school of music in Columbus, therefore it can be said that his one was a family of academicians.[5] Perhaps from his mother's influence, he had a lifelong love for piano,[6] even if mathematics was his main interest since his childhood.[7] He was at first educated in the public schools of Columbus and, before going to the university, he spent a year at Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Virginia.[5]/nIn 1933, during his stay at the Department of Mathematics of the University of California, Berkeley as an instructor, he met Frances Eleonor Moss, who had just started studying for her M.A.:[8] they married in 1937[7] and had three children.[9] With summers off the family enjoyed traveling: they crossed the United States by car at least 20 times, visiting many natural wonders, and looked forward to the AMS meetings, held each year in August. They usually spent abroad their sabbatical leaves, and doing so they visited nearly every European country, witnessing many changes succeeding during the period from the 1950s to the 1980s.[8]/nMorrey graduated from Ohio State University with a B.A. in 1927 and a M.A. in 1928,[10] and then studied at Harvard University under the supervision of George Birkhoff, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1931 with a thesis entitled Invariant functions of Conservative Surface Transformations.[11] After being awarded his Ph.D, he was a National Research Council Fellow at Princeton, at the Rice Institute and finally at the University of Chicago.[7] He became a professor of mathematics at UC Berkeley in 1933, hired by Griffith Conrad Evans,[12] and was a faculty member until his retirement in 1973. In Berkeley, he was early given several administrative duties,[13] for example being the Chairman of the Department of Mathematics during the period 1949\u20131954,[14] and being the Acting Chairman, the Vice Chairman and the Director of the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics at various times. During the years 1937\u20131938 and 1954\u20131955 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study:[15] he was also Visiting Assistant Professor at Northwestern University, Visiting Professor at the University of Chicago and Miller Research Professor at Berkeley.[7] During World War II he was employed as a mathematician at the U.S. Ballistic Research Laboratory in Maryland./nIn 1962 he was elected member of the National Academy of Sciences:[1] on May 12, 1965, he was elected fellow member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[2] From 1967 to 1968 he was president of the American Mathematical Society.[16] On the fifth of June 1973 he was awarded the prestigious Berkeley Citation.[3] Maull (1995a, p.\u00a010) refers also that other honors were granted him, but she does not gives any further detail./nKelley, Lehmer & Robinson (1989, p.\u00a0107) describe him as really very gifted for friendship, having a charming sense of humor[17] and being continuously attentive for people, mathematics and musics. His human qualities are described as the complement to his ability in administrative duties and in scientific research:[18] as a confirmation of his skills in scientific research, also Maull (1995a, p.\u00a010) states that he was one of the strongest workers in analysis./nIn 1985 his widow, Frances Eleonor Morrey, n\u00e9e Ross, established the Charles B.

He greatly contributed to the solution of Hilbert's nineteenth and twentieth problems./nCharles B. Morrey Jr. was a very effective teacher.[13] His book (Morrey 1962) was the forerunner of a sequence of texts on calculus and analytic geometry, written in collaboration with Murray H. Protter. According to Kelley, Lehmer & Robinson (1989, p.\u00a0106) and to Maull (1995a, p.\u00a010), these books have had a wide influence on both university and high school teaching of mathematics.

His greatest achievement is the one for which he first received renown: the creation of the Metal Men. The method through which Doc Magnus created the Metal Man has varied over years with various writers. At first they were just blank slate robots with responsometers, devices which generated their intelligence and personalities which just happened to be evocative of the metals from which they were formed.[2]/nIn an attempt to boost sales of the comic book, the characters underwent vast changes. The Metal Men all assumed human alter egos, while Doc Magnus became a fugitive scientist dedicated to global conquest. His personality change was credited to having been kidnapped, reawakened, and brainwashed by a mad dictator. Sales plunged instead and the comic was not printed for a few years. Eventually Metal Men was picked up again with Doc's sanity restored and he returned to assist his Metal Men./nAt one point he saved Doom Patrol's Robotman, whose original body had been destroyed by Madame Rouge. Doc Magnus recovered Robotman's brain and built him a new cybernetic body./nIn 1993, a four-part Metal Men miniseries retconned much of their backstory. It was revealed that the responsometers were not responsible for the Metal Men's sentience and that the Metal Men actually were imprinted with the intellects and personalities of real people: Magnus' own brother Mike, his fiancee Sharon, two lab workers Redmond Wilde and Randy Pressman, a janitor named Thomas Tinkham, and a pizza-delivery man named Jack. These unfortunate personalities were accidentally transferred to blank robots in a lab accident. At the climax of the miniseries, Gold, one of his robots, was permanently killed and Doc Magnus mortally wounded. He transferred his personality into a blank, green robot known as Veridium, becoming the new  leader of the Metal Men./nWith the advent of Identity Crisis, Gold is back and Doc Magnus is once again human and played an active role in the series 52./nAs revealed during Infinite Crisis, when Superboy-Prime pounded on the walls of reality, he caused the very fabric of reality to shift, changing and merging histories. The \"blank robots with responsometers\" origin is said to be the definitive origin while the \"human personalities\" origin and the 1993 miniseries has been described as the byproduct of a mental breakdown suffered by Magnus. When Booster Gold visited, asking for help with Skeets, Magnus commented that the Metal Men \"don't quite work anymore\"./nThe responsometers are now described as containing an \"artificial soul\" invented by Doc Magnus, as inspired by T. O. Morrow, who is revealed to have taught him at college and to have been the only one not to laugh at Magnus's theories. After the unexplained dismantling of the Metal Men, Doc Magnus is unable to recreate these souls and restore their personalities. He now takes Prozac for the bipolar disorder which caused his nervous breakdown and the depression which led to the creation of the Plutonium Man, a tremendous, nearly indestructible superweapon based upon the Metal Men, but with Magnus' then-own deranged, twisted worldview as its operating system. It is implied that although the medication is keeping Magnus from doing anything irrational, it is also deadening his imagination and creativity and that this is the reason he cannot recreate the Metal Men./nMagnus is approached by government agents hoping to use the Metal Men as soulless smart weapons, an offer Magnus rejects. Through all of this, Magnus visits Morrow in his cell in Haven. Morrow warns Magnus that there have been numerous abductions of \"mad\" scientists, including Doctor Sivana, whose lair Magnus investigates./nEventually Morrow himself disappears, leaving a note for his former student with a string in machine code. Using the code, Magnus is able to revive Mercury, but his robotic friend and creation is apparently destroyed again while trying to save him from the conspiracy trying to kidnap every mad scientist in the DCU./nDuring Week 22, mindless replicas of the Metal Men force Magnus to escape from his burned house before he is captured by what is revealed to be a separate group \"Chang Tzu's Science Squad\".[3] This would be the second time Magnus has confronted Chang Tzu. A previous incarnation of the villain once managed to brainwash the Metal Men, but their loyalty to Magnus restored their rightful minds.[2]/nThis group is based on Oolong Island (said to be part of the territory of China) and has been responsible for the disappearing scientists (including Professor Morrow). The group is being financed by Intergang with the collusion, it is implied, of the Chinese government. The assembled scientists have been given unlimited budgets to invent various super weapons including, in particular, various types of robots./nDuring Week 23, a giant robot, piloted by animals from Intergang, delivers Doc Magnus to Oolong Island.[4]/nMagnus is assigned to design and construct a new Plutonium Man robot, but deliberately makes little progress, saying to Morrow that the original Plutonium Man was an expression of his pain and rage brought on by his mental illness and that the reason he takes his medication is to prevent himself from doing something like that again. Morrow reveals this to the Island's leaders and Magnus's medication is confiscated./nMagnus then proceeds to work on Plutonium Man, saying this time he will \"do it right\". Though he is unstable due to his lack of medication, Magnus is not fully co-operating with Chang Tzu. Magnus goes about scavenging materials from various items (gold from a gold watch, lead from lead shielding, mercury from thermometers, and tin from cans of baked beans which he adopts as his sole diet - presumably to ensure the other scientists will not want to spend too much time with him, as well). This allows him to reconstruct his Metal Men, albeit only a few inches high. These new Metal Men are shown to help Magnus remain sane despite being off his pills, such as when they persuade him to deactivate the now completed Plutonium Man after he turns it on during a period of depression./nOoolong Island is attacked by the JSA seeking to rescue Black Adam, and Chang Tzu orders the Plutonium Man activated. Chang notes that he has been spying on Magnus and knows that several metals have entered the lab and not come back out. The Metal Men attack Chang Tzu, allowing Magnus to escape and switch off the Island's defenses. While he does this Morrow confronts Magnus and destroys Mercury, yet again. Magnus explains to Morrow why it's pointless to stop him from deactivating the shields as the JSA will get in eventually, and instead offers him the chance to teleport out, saying that Morrow was \"the best teacher I ever knew\" and that he tries \"to over look the psychopathic super villain thing\". Morrow accepts the offer./nMagnus is then confronted by Chang Tzu whom he apparently kills with the aid of Lead and what he describes as a particle wave ray gun. Magnus also indicates this shooting was a result of his irrationality, brought on by the lack of his medications. Magnus then surrenders to the JSA./nWith all charges against him dropped, due to being coerced into collaboration, Will Magnus returns to his home and laboratory. There, when Booster Gold visits him again, exactly one year after their last meeting, with a salvaged responsometer containing Skeets' \"memself\", asking him to somehow restore the robot destroyed by Mister Mind, Magnus agrees. He reveals to have in his possession a copy of Skeets' memories, and so he is able to rebuild him as a security droid 2.0, slightly more advanced, but oblivious of the events of the past years./nNow sane again, he returns to working on his Metal Men./nIn the Superman/Batman series Doc Magnus is shown working again with his Metal Men. He has even built a new one, the spunky and wisecracking gynoid Copper. Despite contrary advice from his fianc\u00e9e he asks Bruce Wayne for a tryout of his Metal Men as security guards. The trial is successful, but the Metal Men fail on the field, due to mistrust by the human personnel and Brainiac's influence, leaving Doc Magnus the responsibility of saving the day.[5]/nMagnus has recently assisted the Justice League of America with the rebuilding of Red Tornado. After Red Tornado's first intended body is stolen by Amazo, he is called on again to provide Red Tornado with yet another new body, more powerful and advanced than the previous one. Despite his good intentions, the attempts comes to another downfall, and almost spells his death, when Amazo returns to claim the newer and stronger body for himself./nThe Metal Men are later restored as a second feature in the revamped Doom Patrol (5th series), written by Keith Giffen. Now living in simple suburbia in Kanigher Street, the Metal Men seem to be affected by his currently, partly deranged, state of mind. Iron seems unaffected, Gold is now humorously self-obsessed and magniloquent, Platina is lovesick, Lead is dimwitted and prone to errors, Tin is always scared and affected by chronic self-esteem issues, and Mercury, once brilliant and humorous, has now developed the same bipolar disturbance affecting Will Magnus himself, and refuses to take medications. Copper, the newest and seventh member, is disturbingly ignored by her teammates, who often refuse to acknowledge her presence despite being side by side with her./nIn The New 52 timeline, Will Magnus is first mentioned in the Forever Evil storyline. A rebuilt Cyborg heads out to find Will Magnus so that he can learn about his \"Metal Men\" project.[6] Meeting with Will Magnus, Cyborg learns that he can not help him. Magnus tells him the history of the Metal Men project, how they were built to execute search and rescue missions that humans could not tackle. After he was able to get them online, the government went back on their word and chose to have the Metal Men become assassins. The Metal Men hid at Magnus' apartment where they help protect Magnus and the population from an experiment gone wrong, destroying themselves in the process. Seeing their responsometers that control them in Magnus' lab, Cyborg senses that their minds and hearts are still active encouraging Magus to activate them once more to help him.[7]/nWhen the Conner Kent version of Superboy shows up asking for help, Superman gathers all the geniuses he knows, including, but not limited to, Mister Terrific, Batman, Ted Kord and Will Magnus. Examination of Conner leads the group to ponder evidence that the universe has been rebooted at least three times.[8]/nNormally, Will Magnus had no special abilities aside from his great intellect. His vast intelligence was responsible for the creation of the Metal Men, along with various other robots./nAs Veridium, Magnus could manipulate heat and energy.[9]/nWill Magnus appears in DC Universe Online as a vendor in the Watchtower's Tech Wing.", "5652858": "Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi (born 1953 in Kerman) is an Iranian politician and was the former minister of science and technology in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad./nMr. Zahedi was approved by Iran's parliament with the fewest supporting votes possible (supporters had only one vote more than opponents).

Much of his work occurs in the form of dialogue, and the views of the interlocutors may not represent the author's own.[6]/nAccording to Cassiodorus, Martianus was a native of Madaura\u2014which had been the native city of Apuleius\u2014in the Roman province of Africa (now Souk Ahras, Algeria). He appears to have practiced as a jurist at Roman Carthage./nMartianus was active during the 5th century, writing after the sack of Rome by Alaric I in 410, which he mentions, but apparently before the conquest of North Africa by the Vandals in 429.[7]/nAs early as the middle of the 6th century, Securus Memor Felix, a professor of rhetoric, received the text in Rome, for his personal subscription at the end of Book I (or Book II in many manuscripts) records that he was working \"from most corrupt exemplars\". Gerardus Vossius erroneously took this to mean that Martianus was himself active in the 6th century, giving rise to a long-standing misconception about Martianus's dating.[8]/nThe lunar crater Capella is named after him./nThis single encyclopedic work, De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii (\"On the Marriage of Philology and Mercury\"), sometimes called De septem disciplinis (\"On the seven disciplines\") or the Satyricon,[9] is an elaborate didactic allegory written in a mixture of prose and elaborately allusive verse, a prosimetrum in the manner of the Menippean satires of Varro. The style is wordy and involved, loaded with metaphor and bizarre expressions. The book was of great importance in defining the standard formula of academic learning from the Christianized Roman Empire of the fifth century until the Renaissance of the 12th century. This formula included a medieval love for allegory (in particular personifications) as a means of presenting knowledge, and a structuring of that learning around the seven liberal arts./nThe book, embracing in r\u00e9sum\u00e9 form the narrowed classical culture of his time, was dedicated to his son. Its frame story in the first two books relates the courtship and wedding of Mercury (intelligent or profitable pursuit), who has been refused by Wisdom, Divination and the Soul, with the maiden Philologia (learning, or more literally the love of letters and study), who is made immortal under the protection of the gods, the Muses, the Cardinal Virtues and the Graces. The title refers to the allegorical union of the intellectually profitable pursuit (Mercury) of learning by way of the art of letters (Philology)./nAmong the wedding gifts are seven maids who will be Philology's servants. They are the seven liberal arts: Grammar (an old woman with a knife for excising children's grammatical errors), Dialectic, Rhetoric (a tall woman with a dress decorated with figures of speech and armed in a fashion to harm adversaries), Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy and (musical) Harmony. As each art is introduced, she gives an exposition of the principles of the science she represents, thereby providing a summary of the seven liberal arts. Two other arts, Architecture and Medicine, were present at the feast, but since they care for earthly things, they were to keep silent in the company of the celestial deities./nEach book is an abstract or a compilation from earlier authors. The treatment of the subjects belongs to a tradition which goes back to Varro's Disciplinae, even to Varro's passing allusion to architecture and medicine, which in Martianus Capella's day were mechanics' arts, material for clever slaves but not for senators. The classical Roman curriculum, which was to pass\u2014largely through Martianus Capella's book\u2014into the early medieval period, was modified but scarcely revolutionized by Christianity. The verse portions, on the whole correct and classically constructed, are in imitation of Varro./nThe eighth book describes a modified geocentric astronomical model, in which the Earth is at rest in the center of the universe and circled by the moon, the sun, three planets and the stars, while Mercury and Venus circle the Sun.[10] This view was singled out for praise by Copernicus in Book I of his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium./nMartianus Capella can best be understood in terms of the reputation of his book.[11] The work was read, taught, and commented upon throughout the early Middle Ages and shaped European education during the early medieval period and the Carolingian renaissance./nAs early as the end of the fifth century, another African, Fulgentius, composed a work modeled on it. A note found in numerous manuscripts\u2014written by one Securus Memor Felix, who was intending to produce an edition\u2014indicates that by about 534 the dense and convoluted text of De nuptiis had already become hopelessly corrupted by scribal errors[12] (Michael Winterbottom suggests that Securus Memor's work may be the basis of the text found in \"an impressive number of extant books\" written in the ninth century).[13] Another sixth-century writer, Gregory of Tours, attests that it had become virtually a school manual.[14] In his 1959 study, C. Leonardi catalogued 241 existing manuscripts of De nuptiis, attesting to its popularity during the Middle Ages.[13] It was commented upon copiously: by John Scotus Erigena, Hadoard, Alexander Neckham, and Remigius of Auxerre.[15][16] In the eleventh century the German monk Notker Labeo translated the first two books into Old High German. Martianus continued to play a major role as transmitter of ancient learning until the rise of a new system of learning founded on scholastic Aristotelianism. As late as the thirteenth century, Martianus was still credited as having been the efficient cause of the study of astronomy.[17]/nModern interpreters have less interest in Martianus's ideas, \"except for the light his work throws on what men in other times and places knew or thought it was important to know about the artes liberales\".[18] C. S. Lewis, in The Allegory of Love, states that \"the universe, which has produced the bee-orchid and the giraffe, has produced nothing stranger than Martianus Capella\"./nThe editio princeps of De nuptiis, edited by Franciscus Vitalis Bodianus, was printed in Vicenza in 1499. The work's comparatively late date in print, as well as the modest number of later editions,[19] is a marker of the slide in its popularity, save as an elementary educational primer in the liberal arts.[20] For many years the standard edition of the work was that of A. Dick (Teubner, 1925), but J.

As of 2020, Cheng's most recent research work was published in 1996./nIn 1975, Shing-Tung Yau found a novel gradient estimate for solutions of second-order elliptic partial differential equations on certain complete Riemannian manifolds.[3] Cheng and Yau were able to localize Yau's estimate by making use of a method developed by Eugenio Calabi.[CY75] The result, known as the Cheng\u2013Yau gradient estimate, is ubiquitous in the field of geometric analysis. As a consequence, Cheng and Yau were able to show the existence of an eigenfunction, corresponding to the first eigenvalue, of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a complete Riemannian manifold./nCheng and Yau applied the same methodology to understand spacelike hypersurfaces of Minkowski space and the geometry of hypersurfaces in affine space.[CY76a][CY86] A particular application of their results is a Bernstein theorem for closed spacelike hypersurfaces of Minkowski space whose mean curvature is zero; any such hypersurface must be a plane.[CY76a]/nIn 1916, Hermann Weyl found a differential identity for the geometric data of a convex surface in Euclidean space. By applying the maximum principle, he was able to control the extrinsic geometry in terms of the intrinsic geometry. Cheng and Yau generalized this to the context of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds.[CY77b]/nAny strictly convex closed hypersurface in the Euclidean space \u211dn + 1 can be naturally considered as an embedding of the n-dimensional sphere, via the Gauss map. The Minkowski problem asks whether an arbitrary smooth and positive function on the n-dimensional sphere can be realized as the scalar curvature of the Riemannian metric induced by such an embedding. This was resolved in 1953 by Louis Nirenberg, in the case that n is equal to two.[4] In 1976, Cheng and Yau resolved the problem in general.[CY76b]/nBy the use of the Legendre transformation, solutions of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation also provide convex hypersurfaces of Euclidean space; the scalar curvature of the intrinsic metric is prescribed by the right-hand sided of the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation. As such, Cheng and Yau were able to use their resolution of the Minkowski problem to obtain information about solutions of Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations.[CY77a] As a particular application, they obtained the first general existence and uniqueness theory for the boundary-value problem for the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation.

Besides his philosophical work he also published several works on geometry, further developing a non-Euclidean (Riemannian geometry, spherical) theory of geometry, which he called polar geometry. From this geometry he derived a new cosmology with the theory of a Great Earth, which states that the Earth is a maximal sphere in a cyclical space and its surface therefore a total plane, the equator plane of the Cosmos. The (total) plane, as well as the straight line and space as a whole, is flat, without curvature yet closed, running back on itself. Barthel considered this his most important theory, even the most significant thought of the century, as he writes in his autobiography.[2]/nWhile some of his academic colleagues stated that Barthel's theory is geometrically possible and consistent, others did not and accused Barthel of resorting to \"the blight of personal calumny\",[3] deriding him for allegedly \"teaching that the Earth is a disk\" or outright declaring him crazy.

By studying clay tablets, he discovered that the ancient Babylonians knew much more about mathematics and astronomy than had been previously realized. The National Academy of Sciences has called Neugebauer \"the most original and productive scholar of the history of the exact sciences, perhaps of the history of science, of our age.\"/nNeugebauer was born in Innsbruck, Austria. His father Rudolph Neugebauer was a railroad construction engineer and a collector and scholar of Oriental carpets. His parents died when he was quite young. During World War I, Neugebauer enlisted in the Austrian Army and served as an artillery lieutenant on the Italian front and then in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp alongside fellow countryman Ludwig Wittgenstein. In 1919, he entered the University of Graz in electrical engineering and physics and in 1921 he transferred to the University of Munich. From 1922 to 1924, he studied mathematics at the University of G\u00f6ttingen under Richard Courant, Edmund Landau, and Emmy Noether. During 1924\u20131925, he was at the University of Copenhagen, where his interests changed to the history of Egyptian mathematics./nHe returned to G\u00f6ttingen and remained there until 1933. His thesis Die Grundlagen der \u00e4gyptischen Bruchrechnung (\"The Fundamentals of Egyptian Calculation with Fractions\") (Springer, 1926) was a mathematical analysis of the table in the Rhind Papyrus. In 1927, he received his venia legendi for the history of mathematics and served as Privatdozent. In 1927, his first paper on Babylonian mathematics was an account of the origin of the sexagesimal system./nIn 1929, Neugebauer founded Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Astronomie und Physik (QS), a Springer series devoted to the history of the mathematical sciences, in which he published extended papers on Egyptian computational techniques in arithmetic and geometry, including the Moscow Papyrus, the most important text for geometry. Neugebauer had worked on the Moscow Papyrus in Leningrad in 1928./nIn 1931, he founded the review journal Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete (Zbl), his most important contribution to modern mathematics.[citation needed] When Adolf Hitler became chancellor in 1933, Neugebauer was asked to sign an oath of loyalty to the new German government, but he refused and was promptly suspended from employment. In 1934, he joined the University of Copenhagen as a full professor of mathematics. In 1936, he published a paper on the method of dating and analyzing texts using diophantine equations. During 1935\u20131937, he published a corpus of texts named Mathematische Keilschrift-Texte (MKT). MKT was a colossal work, in size, detail, and depth, and its contents showed that Babylonian mathematics far surpassed anything one could imagine from a knowledge of Egyptian and Greek mathematics. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1928 in Bologna and a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.[1]/nIn 1939, after the Zentralblatt was taken over by the Nazis, he moved to the United States, joined the mathematics department at Brown University, and founded Mathematical Reviews. He became an American citizen and remained at Brown for most of his career, founding the History of Mathematics Department there in 1947 and becoming University Professor. Jointly with the American Assyriologist Abraham Sachs, he published Mathematical Cuneiform Texts in 1945, which has remained a standard English-language work on Babylonian mathematics. In 1967, he was awarded the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship by the American Astronomical Society. In 1977, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1979, he received the Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics from the Mathematical Association of America. In 1984, he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had been a member since 1950./nNeugebauer was also interested in chronology. He was able to reconstruct the Alexandrian Christian calendar and its origin from the Alexandrian Jewish calendar as of about the 4th century, at least 200 years prior to any other source for either calendar. Thus, the Jewish calendar was derived by combining the 19-year cycle using the Alexandrian year with the seven-day week, and was then slightly modified by the Christians to prevent Easter from ever coinciding with Passover. The ecclesiastical calendar, considered by church historians to be highly scientific and deeply complex, turned out to be quite simple./nIn 1988, by studying a scrap of Greek papyrus, Neugebauer discovered the most important single piece of evidence to date for the extensive transmission of Babylonian astronomy to the Greeks and for the continuing use of Babylonian methods for 400 years even after Ptolemy wrote the Almagest. His last paper, \"From Assyriology to Renaissance Art\", published in 1989, detailed the history of a single astronomical parameter, the mean length of the synodic month, from cuneiform tablets, to the papyrus fragment just mentioned, to the Jewish calendar, to an early 15th-century book of hours./nIn 1986, Neugebauer was awarded the Balzan Prize \"for his fundamental research into the exact sciences in the ancient world, in particular, on ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek astronomy, which has put our understanding of ancient science on a new footing and illuminated its transmission to the classical and medieval worlds. For his outstanding success in promoting interest and further research in the history of science\" (Motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). Neugebauer donated the prize money of 250,000 Swiss francs to the Institute for Advanced Study./nNeugebauer began his career as a mathematician, then turned to Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics, and then took up the history of mathematical astronomy. In a career which spanned sixty-five years, he largely created modern understanding of mathematical astronomy in Babylon and Egypt, through Greco-Roman antiquity, to India, the Islamic world, and Europe of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The noted physicist and astronomer Gerry Neugebauer at Caltech was his son./nIn 1936, he gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.

In 1999, Macintyre moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he was Professor of Mathematics until 2002, when he moved to Queen Mary College, University of London. Macintyre was the first Scientific Director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS) in Edinburgh./nMacintyre is known for many important results. These include classification of aleph-one categorical theories of groups and fields in 1971, which was very influential in the development of geometric stability theory.[citation needed] In 1976, he proved a result on quantifier elimination for p-adic fields from which a theory of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometry for p-adic fields follows (in analogy with that for the real field) as shown by Jan Denef and Lou van den Dries and others. This quantifier elimination theorem was used by Jan Denef in 1984 to prove a conjecture of Jean-Pierre Serre on rationality of various p-adic Poincar\u00e9 series, and subsequently these methods have been applied to prove rationality of a wide range of generating functions in group theory (e.g. subgroup growth) and number theory by various authors, notably Dan Segal and Marcus du Sautoy. Macintyre worked with Zo\u00e9 Chatzidakis and Lou van den Dries on definable sets over finite fields generalising the estimates of Serge Lang and Andr\u00e9 Weil to definable sets an revisiting the work of James Ax on the logic of finite and pseudofinite fields. He initiated and proved results on \nthe model theory of difference fields and of Frobenius automorphisms, where he proved extensions of Ax's work to this setting (including model-companions and decidability). Independently Ehud Hrushovski has proved model-theoretic results on Frobenius automorphisms. Macintyre developed a first-order model theory for intersection theory and showed connections to Alexander Grothendieck's standard conjectures on algebraic cycles./nMacintyre has proved many results on the model theory of real and complex exponentiation. With Alex Wilkie he proved the decidability of real exponential fields (solving a problem of Alfred Tarski) modulo Schanuel's conjecture from transcendental number theory. With Lou van den Dries he initiated and studied the model theory of logarithmic-exponential series and Hardy fields. Together with David Marker and Lou van den Dries, he proved several results on the model theory of the real field equipped with restricted analytic functions, which has had many applications to exponentiation and O-minimality. The work of van den Dries-Macintyre-Marker has found many applications to (and is a very natural setting for problems in) Diophantine geometry on Shimura varieties (Anand Pillay, Sergei Starchenko, Jonathan Pila) and representation theory (Wilfried Schmid and Kari Vilonen). Macintyre has proved results on Boris Zilber's theory of the complex exponentiation, and Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields./nMacintyre and Jamshid Derakhshan have developed a model theory for the adele ring of a number field where they prove results on quantifier elimination and measurability of definable sets. They use and extend foundational work by Solomon Feferman and Robert Vaught on the first-order theory of products of algebraic structures./nThe adele ring was introduced by Claude Chevalley. (The word \"adele\" is short for \"additive idele\"[2] and it was invented by Andr\u00e9 Weil. The previous name was the valuation vectors.[citation needed]) The initial purpose for introducing adeles was simplifying and clarifying class field theory.

After two years of novitiate training, he matriculated at the University of W\u00fcrzburg on 6 November 1629 to begin a three-year study of Philosophy, following the normal academic path prescribed for Jesuit seminarians. Owing to the Swedish invasion of W\u00fcrzburg in October 1631, the Jesuit community fled the city. Schott went, first to the Jesuit seminary of Tournai in Belgium, and subsequently, in 1633, to Caltagirone in Sicily, where he continued his study of Theology. After two years at Caltagirone, he was transferred to Palermo for his final year study of Theology after which, in 1637, he was ordained a priest. For the next fifteen years he held a range of teaching and pastoral positions in various Jesuit colleges in Sicily. In 1652, following correspondence with his old mathematics teacher at W\u00fcrzburg, Fr. Athanasius Kircher, now an internationally acclaimed scholar at the Collegio Romano, Schott was transferred to the Collegio to work as Kircher's assistant. He was to spend the next two and a half years assisting Kircher, but also assembling material of his own for which he would later seek a publisher./nIn 1655 Schott returned to Germany, first to Mainz, and later the same year to W\u00fcrzburg where he was to remain until his death. His return to Germany appears to have been partly motivated by the desire of his Jesuit superiors to mollify the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, Johann von Sch\u00f6nborn, with whom relations had been strained./nSchott was the author of numerous works from the fields of mathematics, physics, and magic. However, those works were mostly compilations of reports, articles or books he read and his own repeated experiments; he did little, if any, original research./nSchott is most widely known for his works on hydraulic and mechanical instruments. His treatise on \"chronometric marvels\" is the first work describing a universal joint and providing the classification of gear teeth./nAmong his most famous works is the book Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis (4 vols., W\u00fcrtzburg, 1657\u20131659), filled with many mathematical problems and physical experiments, mostly from the areas of optics and acoustics. His Mechanica hydraulica-pneumatica (W\u00fcrtzburg, 1657) contains the first description of von Guericke's air pump. He also published Pantometrum Kircherianum (W\u00fcrtzburg, 1660); Physica curiosa (W\u00fcrtzburg, 1662), a supplement to the Magia universalis; Anatomia physico-hydrostatica fontium et fluminum (W\u00fcrtzburg, 1663), Technica Curiosa (1664), \"Organum Mathematicum\" (1668) and several editions of a Cursus mathematicus. He was also the editor of the Itinerarium extaticum of Athanasius Kircher and the Amussis Ferdinandea of Albert Curtz./nGaspar Schott served as an inspiration for the creation of Gaspar Wanderdrossel, one of the main characters of Umberto Eco's novel The Island of the Day Before.", "64111134": "Park Kyung-mee (Korean:\u00a0\ubc15\uacbd\ubbf8; Hanja:\u00a0\u6734\u7085\u7f8e; born 15 October 1965) is a South Korean politician who served as the Spokesperson of President Moon Jae-in from 2021 to 2022.[1] She was previously a professor of mathematics education at Hongik University and Chungbuk National University.[2]/nShe is widely known to the public for her educational books on mathematics.[3][4] After becoming a politician, she continues such effort through her YouTube channel.[5] She also hosted a famous TV debate programme at MBC in 2014 becoming its first female host in its history which dates back to 1999.[6]/nIn the 2016 general election, Park was the first candidate to be named for Democratic Party's proportional representation list.

Well-known and important concepts such as the Legendre polynomials and Legendre transformation are named after him. He is also known for his contributions to the method of least squares, and was the first to officially publish on it, though Carl Friedrich Gauss had discovered it before him.[4][5]/nAdrien-Marie Legendre was born in Paris on 18 September 1752 to a wealthy family. He received his education at the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin in Paris, and defended his thesis in physics and mathematics in 1770. He taught at the \u00c9cole Militaire in Paris from 1775 to 1780 and at the \u00c9cole Normale from 1795. At the same time, he was associated with the Bureau des Longitudes. In 1782, the Berlin Academy awarded Legendre a prize for his treatise on projectiles in resistant media. This treatise also brought him to the attention of Lagrange.[6]/nThe Acad\u00e9mie des sciences made Legendre an adjoint member in 1783 and an associate in 1785. In 1789, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[7]/nHe assisted with the Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790) to calculate the precise distance between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory by means of trigonometry. To this end in 1787 he visited Dover and London together with Dominique, comte de Cassini and Pierre M\u00e9chain. The three also visited William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus./nLegendre lost his private fortune in 1793 during the French Revolution. That year, he also married Marguerite-Claudine Couhin, who helped him put his affairs in order. In 1795, Legendre became one of six members of the mathematics section of the reconstituted Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, renamed the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts. Later, in 1803, Napoleon reorganized the Institut National, and Legendre became a member of the Geometry section. From 1799 to 1812, Legendre served as mathematics examiner for graduating artillery students at the \u00c9cole Militaire and from 1799 to 1815 he served as permanent mathematics examiner for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.[8] In 1824, Legendre's pension from the \u00c9cole Militaire was stopped because he refused to vote for the government candidate at the Institut National.[6] His pension was partially reinstated with the change in government in 1828. In 1831, he was made an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur.[citation needed]/nLegendre died in Paris on 9 January 1833, after a long and painful illness, and Legendre's widow carefully preserved his belongings to memorialize him. Upon her death in 1856, she was buried next to her husband in the village of Auteuil, where the couple had lived, and left their last country house to the village. Legendre's name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower./nAbel's work on elliptic functions was built on Legendre's, and some of Gauss' work in statistics and number theory completed that of Legendre. He developed, and first communicated to his contemporaries before Gauss, the least squares method [9] which has broad application in linear regression, signal processing, statistics, and curve fitting; this was published in 1806 as an appendix to his book on the paths of comets. Today, the term \"least squares method\" is used as a direct translation from the French \"m\u00e9thode des moindres carr\u00e9s\"./nHis major work is Exercices de Calcul Int\u00e9gral, published in three volumes in 1811, 1817 and 1819. In the first volume he introduced the basic properties of elliptic integrals, beta functions and gamma functions, introducing the symbol \u0393 normalizing it to \u0393(n+1) = n!. Further results on the beta and gamma functions along with their applications to mechanics \u2013 such as the rotation of the earth, and the attraction of ellipsoids \u2013 appeared in the second volume.[10] In 1830, he gave a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for exponent n\u00a0=\u00a05, which was also proven by Lejeune Dirichlet in 1828.[10]/nIn number theory, he conjectured the quadratic reciprocity law, subsequently proved by Gauss; in connection to this, the Legendre symbol is named after him. He also did pioneering work on the distribution of primes, and on the application of analysis to number theory. His 1798 conjecture of the prime number theorem was rigorously proved by Hadamard and de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin in 1896./nLegendre did an impressive amount of work on elliptic functions, including the classification of elliptic integrals, but it took Abel's stroke of genius to study the inverses of Jacobi's functions and solve the problem completely./nHe is known for the Legendre transformation, which is used to go from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics. In thermodynamics it is also used to obtain the enthalpy and the Helmholtz and Gibbs (free) energies from the internal energy. He is also the namesake of the Legendre polynomials, solutions to Legendre's differential equation, which occur frequently in physics and engineering applications, such as electrostatics./nLegendre is best known as the author of \u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, which was published in 1794 and was the leading elementary text on the topic for around 100 years. This text greatly rearranged and simplified many of the propositions from Euclid's Elements to create a more effective textbook./nFor two centuries, until the recent discovery of the error in 2005, books, paintings and articles have incorrectly shown a profile portrait of the obscure French politician Louis Legendre (1752\u20131797) as a portrait of the mathematician. The error arose from the fact that the sketch was labelled simply \"Legendre\" and appeared in a book along with contemporary mathematicians such as Lagrange. The only known portrait of Legendre, rediscovered in 2008, is found in the 1820 book Album de 73 portraits-charge aquarell\u00e9s des membres de I'Institut, a book of caricatures of seventy-three members of the Institut de France in Paris by the French artist Julien-L\u00e9opold Boilly as shown below:[12][2]", "12894753": "Pietro Abbati Marescotti (1 September 1768 \u2013 7 May 1842) was an Italian mathematician who taught in Modena.[1]/nBorn in Modena, Pietro Abbati descended from a 16th-century noble family who were related to the Marescotti local family. In acknowledgment of his mathematical and artistic distinction, and in return for his services managing the water and street systems of Modena, Abbati was permitted in 1818 to add the name Marescotti to his own surname.[1]/nHe was born in Modena and received a superior education in mathematics at the university there, studying with Luigi Fantini, Paolo Cassiani and Giovan Battista Venturi.[1] In an 1802 letter to his friend Paolo Ruffini, Abbati extended the proof to the unsolvability of equations of degree greater than five. In 1807, he was named as an advisor to Francis IV, Duke of Modena. Three years later, he became ministry of state economics and education, with particular responsibility for waterworks and streets./nIn 1824, he published On a problem of Daniel Bernoulli and Lagrange. In 1826, he was named a member of the Accademia nazionale delle scienze detta dei XL (\"National Association of the Sciences\", also known as \"Academy of the Forty\"), a learned society composed of forty eminent Italian scientists.[1]/nHe was friends with Paolo Ruffini his entire life, and engaged in mathematical research with him (although without any official recognition), especially in the areas of algebraic equations, probability, and group theory.

The entire university institution, including the teaching staff and all the books from its library, were moved to Coimbra where the University of Coimbra was definitively installed. Lisbon became a university city again in 1911 when the current University of Lisbon was founded, through the union of newly created and older schools, like the 19th century Polytechnic School (Escola Polit\u00e9cnica), the Royal Medical School of Lisbon (Real Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Lisboa) and the Letters Higher Studies (Curso Superior de Letras)./nThe Faculty of Law (Portuguese: Faculdade de Direito)[2] was officially created by a Decree of March 22, 1911 as Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Econ\u00f3micas e Pol\u00edticas, but was only installed in 1913, and was given its current designation later in 1918.

His talent for science showed itself while he was still a schoolboy, and indeed his removal from Eton to Harrow is said to have been occasioned by an accidental explosion which occurred whilst he was performing an experiment for his own amusement. At Harrow he obtained a Lyon scholarship in 1842, and at Oxford in 1845 a first-class in mathematics, in 1846 the junior and in 1847 the senior university mathematical scholarship./nOn 27 November 1861 at Bexley in Kent, he married Elisa (\"Lise\") Taylor Arbuthnot, daughter of William Urquhart Arbuthnot (son of Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet)./nTheir children included William Hugh Spottiswoode (1864\u20131915)[4][5] and Cyril Andrew Spottiswoode (1867\u20131915).[6]/nIn 1846 he left Oxford to take his father's place in the business, in which he was engaged until his death. In 1847 he issued five pamphlets entitled Meditationes analyticae. This was his first publication of original mathematical work, and from this time scarcely a year passed in which he did not give to the world further mathematical research./nIn 1856 Spottiswoode travelled in eastern Russia, and in 1860 in Croatia and Hungary; of the former expedition he has left a record, A Tarantasse Journey through Eastern Russia in the Autumn of 1856 (London, 1857)./nIn 1870 he was elected president of the London Mathematical Society. In 1871 he began to turn his attention to experimental physics, his earlier researches bearing upon the light polarization and his later work upon the electrical discharge in rarefied gases. He wrote a popular treatise on the former subject for the Nature Series in 1874. In 1878 he was elected president of the British Association and in the same year president of the Royal Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1853./nHe died in London of typhoid fever on 27 June 1883 and was buried in the south transept[7] of Westminster Abbey.[8]/nAs a mathematician, he occupied himself with many branches of his favorite science, more especially with higher algebra, including the theory of determinants, with the general calculus of symbols, and with the application of analysis to geometry and mechanics./nThe following brief review of his mathematical work is quoted from the obituary notice which appeared in the Proceedings of tile Royal Society (xxxviii. 34):", "2769461": "Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh (Russian: \u041c\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0432 \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0435\u0301\u043b\u0434\u044b\u0448; 10 February\u00a0[O.S. 28 January]\u00a01911 \u2013 24 June 1978) was a Soviet mathematician who worked as an engineer in the Soviet space program./nHe was the academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (1946), President of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (1961\u20131975), three-time Hero of Socialist Labour (1956, 1961, 1971), and fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1968). He was one of the key figures behind the Soviet space program. Among scientific circles of the USSR Keldysh was known by the epithet \"the Chief Theoretician\"[1] in analogy with epithet \"the Chief Designer\" used for Sergei Korolev./nKeldysh was born to a professional family of Russian nobility.[2] His grandfather, Mikhail Fomich Keldysh (1839\u20131920), was a military physician, who retired with the military rank of General.[3] Keldysh's grandmother, Natalia Keldysh (n\u00e9e Brusilova), was a cousin of general Aleksei Brusilov. Keldysh's maternal grandfather, Alexander Nikolayevich Skvortsov, was a General of Infantry, and fought in the Caucasian War./nKeldysh's father, Vsevolod Mikhailovich Keldysh (1878\u20131965), was a civil engineer, Major General of the Engineering Service, and a full professor, teaching at the Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy from 1918. He became a Distinguished Engineering Scientist of the Soviet Union (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420) in 1944. He was one of the authors of contemporary methods for calculating the strength of reinforced concrete, and a designer of the Moscow Canal and Moscow Metro projects./nSeveral members of the Keldysh family were victims of political repressions. In the 1930s Keldysh's uncle was sent to a labor camp on the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal construction site. In 1935 Keldysh's mother was arrested but was released after a few weeks. It was a part of the campaign of collecting gold from the population, but after Keldysh's father brought all the jewelry the family had, the unsatisfied NKVD officer returned \"all this garbage\" back.[4] Keldysh's brother Mikhail, a historian who specialized in Medieval Germany, was arrested in 1936 and executed in 1937 on suspicion of being a German spy. In 1938 another of Keldysh's brothers, Alexander, was arrested as a French spy. Alexander was spared because of the slight liberalization of the repressions during the transfer of the NKVD leadership from Nikolai Yezhov to Lavrentiy Beria, and was acquitted in the court./nThe strongest influence on Keldysh was his older sister, Lyudmila Keldysh (1904\u20131976), a mathematician and Keldysh's first teacher. Among her children are Leonid Keldysh, director of Lebedev Physical Institute and Sergei Novikov, a mathematician./nKeldysh was born in 1911 in Riga. When he was four the family evacuated to Moscow during the First World War. In the first years of the Soviet Union he was refused entrance to an Institute of Civil Engineers because of his attachment to a noble family. Later, he managed to enter and graduate from the Physics and Mathematics department of the Moscow State University. He obtained employment at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) under Mikhail Lavrentyev and Sergey Chaplygin./nWorking at TsAGI he explained the auto-oscillation effects of flutter (in-flight auto-induced oscillations and structural deformations), and shimmy (auto-oscillation in the nose-wheel of aircraft undercarriages while on the ground). The effects were responsible for many aircraft catastrophes at the time./nIn 1937 Keldysh became Doctor of Science with his dissertation entitled Complex Variable and Harmonic Functions Representation by Polynomial Series, and was appointed a Professor of Moscow State University.[5]  In 1943 he became a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. He got his first Stalin Prize in 1946 for his works on aircraft auto-oscillations. In 1943 he also became a full member of the Academy and the Director of NII-1 (Research Institute number 1) of the Department of the Aviation Industry. He also headed the Department of Applied Mechanics of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. In 1966 this department became an independent organization as the Institute of Applied Mathematics. After his death in 1978 it is named after him to become the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics./nDuring the 1940s Keldysh became the leader of a group of applied mathematicians involved in almost all large scientific projects of the Soviet Union. Keldysh created the Calculation Bureau that carried most of the mathematical problems related to the development of nuclear weapons. The bureau is also credited with design of the first Soviet computers. In 1947 he became a member of the Communist Party./nKeldysh's main efforts were devoted to jet propulsion and rockets including supersonic gas dynamics, heat and mass exchange, and heat shielding. 1959 saw successful testing of the Soviet first cruise missile Burya./nIn 1954 Keldysh, Sergei Korolev and Mikhail Tikhonravov submitted a letter to the Soviet Government proposing development of an artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. The letter was rejected, and the group filed exaggerated Soviet newspaper articles which influenced American authorities to start satellite programs. This in turn began the effort that culminated in the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1 in October 1957, which marked the beginning of mankind's Space Age.[6][7][8] In 1955 Keldysh was appointed chairman of the Satellite Committee at the Academy of Science. In recognition of his contribution to the problems of defense Keldysh was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour (1956) and the Lenin Prize (1957). In 1961 he received a second H\u0435r\u043e of Socialist Labour award for his contribution to Yuri Gagarin's flight into space, the first person to orbit the Earth./nIn 1961 Keldysh was elected President of the Academy of Sciences and kept this position for 14 years. Concomitantly, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His last scientific works were devoted to creation of the Shuttle Buran. In 1962 he was elected a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union./nKeldysh was 67 when he suddenly died on June 24, 1978. He was honoured with a state funeral and his ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on Red Square./nKeldysh was a member of many foreign academies of sciences, including the Mongolian Academy of Sciences (1961), Polish Academy of Sciences (1962), Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (1962), and Romanian Academy of Sciences (1965). He was also an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1966), Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (1966), Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1970), and Royal Society of Edinburgh (1968), foreign corresponding member of the German Academy of Sciences (1966), and Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig (1966)./nKeldysh was awarded the Stalin Prize (1942, 1946), Lenin Prize (1957), six Orders of Lenin, three other orders, numerous medals and four foreign orders./nThe crater Keldysh on the Moon, and the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh are named after him. A minor planet, 2186 Keldysh discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh, is named in his honor.[9]/nA street (Akad\u0113mi\u0137a Mstislava Keldi\u0161a iela) was named after Keldysh in the district of P\u013cavnieki in his native Riga, Latvia.

In general, these problems are hard, but there are two major subclasses of satisfiability for which polynomial time solutions are known: 2-satisfiability (where each clause of the formula has two literals) and Horn-satisfiability (where each clause has at most one positive literal). Lewis expanded the second of these subclasses, by showing that the problem can still be solved in polynomial time\nwhen the input is not already in Horn form, but can be put into Horn form by replacing some variables by their negations. The problem of choosing which variables to negate to make each clause get two positive literals, making the re-signed instance into a Horn set, turns out to be expressible as an instance of 2-satisfiability, the other solvable case of the satisfiability problem. By solving a 2-satisfiability instance to turn the given input into a Horn set, Lewis shows that the instances that can be turned into Horn sets can also be solved in polynomial time.[L78] The time for the sign reassignment in the original version of what Lindhorst and Shahrokhi called \"this elegant result\"[50] was O\u200a(mn2) for an instance with m clauses and n variables, but it can be reduced to linear time by breaking long input clauses into smaller clauses and applying a faster 2-satisfiability algorithm.[51]/nLewis' paper \"Complexity results for classes of quantificational formulas\" (1980) deals with the computational complexity of problems in first-order logic. Such problems are undecidable in general, but there are several special classes of these problems, defined by restricting the order in which their quantifiers appear, that were known to be decidable. One of these special classes, for instance, is the Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class. For each of these special classes, Lewis establishes tight\nexponential time bounds either for deterministic or nondeterministic time complexity. For instance, he shows that the Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class is NEXPTIME-complete, and more specifically that its nondeterministic time complexity is both upper- and lower-bounded by a singly exponential function of the input length.[L80]\nB\u00f6rger, Gr\u00e4del, and Gurevich write that \"this paper initiated the study of the complexity of decidable classes of the decision problem\".[52]/n\"A logic of concrete time intervals\" (1990) concerned temporal logic.[L90] This paper accompanied an earlier Aiken Computation Laboratory technical report, \"Finite-state analysis of asynchronous circuits with bounded temporal uncertainty\", where he first proposed the representation of an asynchronous circuit, with bounded temporal uncertainty on gate transition events, as a finite-state machine. This paper was the earliest work on the verification of timing properties that modeled time both asynchronously and continuously, neither discretizing time nor imposing a global clock.[53]/nSome of Lewis' other heavily cited research papers extend beyond logic.\nHis paper \"Symbolic evaluation and the global value graph\" (1977, with his student John Reif) concerned data-flow analysis and symbolic execution in compilers.[RL]\nAnd his paper \"Symmetric space-bounded computation\" (1982, with Christos Papadimitriou)[LP82]\nwas the first to define symmetric Turing machines and symmetric space complexity classes such as SL (an undirected or reversible analogue of nondeterministic space complexity, later shown to coincide with deterministic logarithmic space).[54]\nIn 1982, he chaired the program committee for the Symposium on Theory of Computing,[STOC] one of the two top research conferences in theoretical computer science, considered broadly.[55]/nLewis is a Visitor of Ralston College and a Life Trustee of the Roxbury Latin School.[56] From 1995 to 2003 he was Trustee of the Charity of Edward Hopkins.[7]\nThe New York Times journalist David Fahrenthold is his son-in-law;[57] while still a Harvard undergraduate, Fahrenthold wrote of his future father-in-law:/nI've heard that if you sit out by the river [i.e. the Charles River] long enough, Dean of the College Harry R.

He also worked with Aristotle at the Lyceum, which means that he was active in Athens prior to Aristotle's death in 322 BC. He observed the movements of the planets and attempted to use Eudoxus' scheme of connected spheres to account for their movements. However, he found that 27 spheres were insufficient to account for the planetary movements, and so he added seven more for a total of 34. According to the description in Aristotle's Metaphysics (XII.8), he added two spheres for the Sun, two for the Moon, and one each for Mercury, Venus, and Mars./nCallippus made careful measurements of the lengths of the seasons, finding them (starting with the spring equinox) to be 94 days, 92 days, 89 days, and 90 days.  This variation in the seasons implies a variation in the speed of the Sun, called the \"solar anomaly\".  He also followed up on the work done by Meton of Athens to measure the length of the year and construct an accurate lunisolar calendar.  The Metonic cycle has 19 tropical years and 235 synodic months in 6,940 days.  The Callippic cycle synchronizes days per orbit and rotations per orbit within the Metonic cycle, noting the difference of one after 4 Metonic cycles, a duration of 76 years.  Distinguishing rotations and days infers knowledge of the precession cycle./nCallippus started his observation cycle on the summer solstice in 330 BC (28 June in the proleptic Julian calendar).  The cycle's begin position, the stellar position and sidereal hour timing the eclipse, are used by later astronomers for calibrating their observations in relation to subsequent eclipses. The Callippic cycle of 76 years appears to be used in the Antikythera mechanism, an ancient astronomical mechanical clock and observational aide of the 2nd century BC (discovered in Mediterranean waters off Greece). The mechanism has a dial for the Callippic cycle and the 76 years are mentioned in the Greek text of the manual of this old device.

After graduation, he worked as an actuary and a statistician at Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (National Institute of Statistics) in Rome and, from 1931, the Trieste insurance company Assicurazioni Generali.

De Finetti developed his ideas on subjective probability in the 1920s independently of Frank P.\u00a0Ramsey.[3] Still, according to the preface of his \"Theory of Probability\", he drew on ideas of Harold Jeffreys, I.\u00a0J.\u00a0Good and B.\u00a0O.\u00a0Koopman. He also reasoned about the connection of economics and probability, and thought that guiding principles to be Paretian optimum further inspired by \"fairness\" criteria.[4] De Finetti held different social and political beliefs through his life: following fascism during his youth, then moving to Christian socialism and finally adhering to the Radical Party.[2][5]/nDe Finetti only became known in the Anglo-American statistical world in the 1950s when L.\u00a0J.\u00a0Savage, who had independently adopted subjectivism, drew him into it; another great champion was Dennis Lindley. De Finetti died in Rome in 1985./nDe Finetti emphasized a predictive inference approach to statistics; he proposed a thought experiment along the following lines (described in greater detail at coherence): You must set the price of a promise to pay $1 if there was life on Mars 1\u00a0billion years ago, and $0 if there was not, and tomorrow the answer will be revealed. You know that your opponent will be able to choose either to buy such a promise from you at the price you have set, or require you to buy such a promise from your opponent, still at the same price. In other words: you set the odds, but your opponent decides which side of the bet will be yours. The price you set is the \"operational subjective probability\" that you assign to the proposition on which you are betting. This price has to obey the probability axioms if you are not to face certain loss, as you would if you set a price above $1 (or a negative price). By considering bets on more than one event, de Finetti could justify additivity. Prices, or equivalently odds, that do not expose you to certain loss through a Dutch book are called coherent./nDe Finetti is also noted for de Finetti's theorem on exchangeable sequences of random variables.

Since 1952 until 2004, Goncharov developed and tested Soviet thermonuclear weapons and led a theoretical department at the Soviet nuclear research facility at Arzamas-16 from 1967 to 2004./nGoncharov was born in Kalinin (reverted to Tver in 1991), 160\u00a0km northwest of Moscow. From 1941 to 1943, he was evacuated with his family to the Kuybyshev region (reverted to Samara in 1991). In 1946 he graduated from high school in Kalinin, winning a gold medal.[1]/nHe enrolled at the Moscow State University in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics \u2013 without taking any entrance exams \u2013 and in 1947 transferred to the Physics and Technical Faculty, from which he graduated in 1952. The Faculty was at Laboratory No. 3 of the USSR Academy of Sciences (now the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics), under the direction of Abram Alikhanov. While here, he trained in mountaineering in the Caucasus.[1]/nIn June 1952, Goncharov was assigned to work in the department of experimental nuclear reactors at KB-11, usually referred to as Arzamas-16 and now known as All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics (VNIIEhF), in Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region. It was a closed entity, constructed by slave labour from a gulag next to the nuclear facility. In his first year, he was deeply affected by the fact he was not allowed to leave, even to visit his parents, but kept himself distracted by the work.[2] He worked as a senior laboratory assistant and from September 1952 as an engineer. In the same year, Goncharov was sent to work in the theoretical department of KB-11 (where Andrei Sakharov was departmental head) in Theoretical Sector 1 under Igor Tamm; there he took part in work on the first Soviet thermonuclear weapon, RDS-6s, tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site on 12 August 1953. In September 1953, Goncharov transferred to the post of staff member of the theoretical department.[1][3]/nHe was a co-author of a detailed feasibility study undertaken by a team in 1954 and 1955, involving the theory, design and calculations of the next-generation RDS-37 device, an air-delivered two-stage thermonuclear bomb which was detonated in 1956: in the first stage, x-ray radiation was produced from a primary nuclear charge; in the second stage the radiation compressed a thermonuclear core resulting in a fusion reaction. The development of this more-efficient and more-powerful Soviet thermonuclear weapon was galvanized by reports of American success with a high-yield device on 1 March 1954, the first of the Castle Bravo tests. The design was what Sakharov referred to as \"the third idea\" which he'd originally mulled over in 1949 (the two-stage model was initiated by Stanislaw Ulam; an original patent application for the invention was submitted by Klaus Fuchs and John von Neumann who were employed at Los Alamos in May 1946). For this work, Goncharov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1956. In 1958, his co-design of a further improved device was tested and then put into production. Between 1959 and 1961, he developed original technical ideas, later credited to him as inventions, which were included in all further Soviet nuclear devices, and he co-designed and was involved in the testing several new bombs. He was involved in the design of the principal physical scheme of the RDS-220 bomb, 'Tsar Bomba', the largest-ever nuclear device. For his creative efforts in the work from 1959, he received the Lenin Prize in 1962.[1][4][5]/nGoncharov proposed methods of measuring the power of underground nuclear tests in 1963. In 1965, using his theoretical results, he suggested a new direction for the design of Soviet thermonuclear weapons of megatonne yields. The first successful test of these improved weapons was conducted in 1966, using his measurement scheme, in tunnels at Novaya Zemlya. This generation of weapons went into mass production and was put into service with the USSR on land and sea-based missiles. Goncharov was appointed to the post of head of the theoretical department of KB-11 in 1967, a position he held until 2004. He officially became a doctor of physical and mathematical sciences in 1973 and a professor in 1995.[1]/nIn the period from 1955 to 1983, Goncharov participated in ten aerial and underground nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk, Novaya Zemlya and Azgir, during most of which time he was deputy head of scientific research or a member of the State Commission. In his later years, he studied and wrote about the history of the Soviet nuclear industry and the development of the nuclear arms race: he compiled the multivolume collection of archival documents \"The Atomic Project of the USSR.

Near the end of his career, he became known for his antisemitism and devotion to far right politics, in the years leading up to World War II./nBorn in Br\u0103ila, Ionescu studied Letters at the University of Bucharest until 1912. Upon graduation, he was appointed teacher at the Matei Basarab High School in Bucharest. When World War I began, he traveled to Germany for additional studies at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Romania's entry into the war on the Entente side prevented him from returning, but he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy in 1919 from the University of Munich. His thesis was entitled Die Logistik als Versuch einer neuen Begr\u00fcndung der Mathematik (\"Formal logic as an attempt at a new foundation of mathematics\")./nBack in Romania, after another brief stint teaching, Ionescu was appointed assistant to Constantin R\u0103dulescu-Motru at the University of Bucharest's department of Logic and Theory of Knowledge./nHis life's work had a profound effect on a generation of Romanian thinkers, first for his studies on comparative religion, philosophy, and mysticism, but later for his nationalist and far right sentiment. Some of the figures he influenced include Constantin Noica, Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Haig Acterian, Jeni Acterian, Mihail Sebastian, Mircea Vulc\u0103nescu, and Petre \u021au\u021bea. The existentialist and partly mystical school of thought Ionescu introduced bore the name Tr\u0103irism. Tr\u0103irism intersected at several points with the ideology of the Iron Guard; the connection became even more direct when many of its adherents also publicly associated with the latter./nIonescu himself was more reserved in his dealings with the Guard. He was the editor of the highly influential newspaper Cuv\u00e2ntul, which had long backed King Carol II \u2013 the major rival of the Guard. However, Ionescu moved away from the monarchy due to Carol's inner circle.

Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.[2]/nEliade notes that this incident marked a profound departure for Ionescu, who in the late 1920s had suggested to Eliade, who was then his student, that he had been tempted \"to give up both journalism and politics and devote myself entirely to Hebraic studies\".[2] Sebastian, though dejected by the incident, opted to keep Ionescu's introduction in the book./nAfter Carol's crackdown on the Iron Guard, Nae Ionescu and his disciples were rounded up and imprisoned at a makeshift camp in Miercurea-Ciuc.

He was known mainly for his great influence on the development of education in Scotland.[2]/nKelland was born in 1808 the son of Philip Kelland (d.1847), curate in Dunster, Somerset, England. He was educated at Sherborne, and was an undergraduate at Queens' College, Cambridge,[3] where he was tutored privately by English mathematician William Hopkins and graduated in 1834 as senior wrangler and first Smith's prizeman.[4] He was ordained in the Church of England. From 1834 to 1838, he was a fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge.[2]/nKelland was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838 and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1839. He served as Secretary of the RSE 1843-4, Vice-President 1857\u201377 and President 1878-9. He won their Keith Medal for the period 1849\u201351.[5]/nHe lived his final years at 20 Clarendon Crescent in western Edinburgh.[6]/nKelland is buried in Warriston Cemetery in the north of the city./nKelland was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1838. He was a successor to Scottish mathematician William Wallace. He became the first English-born and wholly English-educated mathematician to hold that chair.[2]/nKelland joined with Scottish physicist James David Forbes in supporting reforms of the Scottish university system. He was an efficient education reformer. He won the respect of his colleagues, and was regarded highly as a mathematics instructor. He wrote on the reform of the Scottish universities.[2]/nKelland's early research work, undertaken at the University of Cambridge, was influenced by mathematicians Joseph Fourier and Augustin Louis Cauchy. This research is described in his Theory of Heat (1837, 1842) and in some papers. However, this proved not to be based on sound principles.[2]/nIn all, 28 papers published by Kelland, mainly on heat, light and water waves, are listed in the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers. His theoretical work on water waves (1840, 1844), published in Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, tried to explain aspects of the important experiments of John Scott Russell, then being carried out near Edinburgh. Although this work was flawed in some respects, it anticipated some of the results later obtained by George Biddell Airy and George Gabriel Stokes.[2][7]/nKelland wrote analytical papers on General Differentiation in 1839, and Differential Equations in 1853. He gave a geometrical Theory of Parallels outlining a version of non-Euclidean geometry. He wrote mathematics books and edited works of mathematician John Playfair and polymath Thomas Young.[2]/nHe married twice: firstly to \"Miss Pilkington\" secondly to Miss Boswall of Wardie.[8]", "967353": "R. H. Bing (October 20, 1914 \u2013 April 28, 1986) was an American mathematician who worked mainly in the areas of geometric topology and continuum theory.   His father was named Rupert Henry, but Bing's mother  thought that \"Rupert Henry\" was too British for Texas.  She compromised by abbreviating it to R. H. (Singh 1986) Consequently, R.

The term Bing-type topology was coined to describe the style of methods used by Bing./nBing established his reputation early on in 1946, soon after completing his Ph.D. dissertation, by solving the Kline sphere characterization problem. In 1948 he proved that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous, contradicting a published but erroneous 'proof' to the contrary./nIn 1951 he proved results regarding the metrizability of topological spaces, including what would later be called the Bing\u2013Nagata\u2013Smirnov metrization theorem./nIn 1952, Bing showed that the double of a solid Alexander horned sphere was the 3-sphere.  This showed the existence of an involution on the 3-sphere with fixed point set equal to a wildly embedded 2-sphere, which meant that the original Smith conjecture needed to be phrased in a suitable category.  This result also jump-started research into crumpled cubes. The proof involved a method later developed by Bing and others into  set of techniques called Bing shrinking.  Proofs of the generalized Schoenflies conjecture and the double suspension theorem relied on Bing-type shrinking./nBing was fascinated by the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and made several major attacks which ended unsuccessfully, contributing to the reputation of the conjecture as a very difficult one. He did show that a simply connected, closed 3-manifold with the property that every loop was contained in a 3-ball is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Bing was responsible for initiating research into the Property P conjecture, as well as its name, as a potentially more tractable version of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. It was proven in 2004 as a culmination of work from several areas of mathematics. With some irony, this proof was announced some time after Grigori Perelman announced his proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture./nThe side-approximation theorem was considered by Bing to be one of his key discoveries.

Another such example, popularized by E.C.

He summarized and extended the work of his predecessors in his five-volume M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste (Celestial Mechanics) (1799\u20131825). This work translated the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, opening up a broader range of problems. In statistics, the Bayesian interpretation of probability was developed mainly by Laplace.[2]/nLaplace formulated Laplace's equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many branches of mathematical physics, a field that he took a leading role in forming. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him. He restated and developed the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the Solar System and was one of the first scientists to suggest an idea similar to that of a black hole,[3] with Stephen Hawking stating that \"Laplace essentially predicted the existence of black holes\".[1]/nLaplace is regarded as one of the greatest scientists of all time. Sometimes referred to as the French Newton or Newton of France, he has been described as possessing a phenomenal natural mathematical faculty superior to that of almost all of his contemporaries.[4]\nHe was Napoleon's examiner when Napoleon graduated from the \u00c9cole Militaire in Paris in 1785.[5]  Laplace became a count of the Empire in 1806 and was named a marquis in 1817, after the Bourbon Restoration./nSome details of Laplace's life are not known, as records of it were burned in 1925 with the family ch\u00e2teau in Saint Julien de Mailloc, near Lisieux, the home of his great-great-grandson the Comte de Colbert-Laplace. Others had been destroyed earlier, when his house at Arcueil near Paris was looted in 1871.[6]/nLaplace was born in Beaumont-en-Auge, Normandy on 23 March 1749, a village four miles west of Pont l'\u00c9v\u00eaque. According to W. W. Rouse Ball,[7] his father, Pierre de Laplace, owned and farmed the small estates of Maarquis. His great-uncle, Maitre Oliver de Laplace, had held the title of Chirurgien Royal. It would seem that from a pupil he became an usher in the school at Beaumont; but, having procured a letter of introduction to d'Alembert, he went to Paris to advance his fortune. However, Karl Pearson[6] is scathing about the inaccuracies in Rouse Ball's account and states:/nIndeed Caen was probably in Laplace's day the most intellectually active of all the towns of Normandy. It was here that Laplace was educated and was provisionally a professor. It was here he wrote his first paper published in the M\u00e9langes of the Royal Society of Turin, Tome iv. 1766\u20131769, at least two years before he went at 22 or 23 to Paris in 1771. Thus before he was 20 he was in touch with Lagrange in Turin. He did not go to Paris a raw self-taught country lad with only a peasant background! In 1765 at the age of sixteen Laplace left the \"School of the Duke of Orleans\" in Beaumont and went to the University of Caen, where he appears to have studied for five years and was a member of the Sphinx. The \u00c9cole Militaire of Beaumont did not replace the old school until 1776./nHis parents, Pierre Laplace and Marie-Anne Sochon, were from comfortable families. The Laplace family was involved in agriculture until at least 1750, but Pierre Laplace senior was also a cider merchant and syndic of the town of Beaumont./nPierre Simon Laplace attended a school in the village run at a Benedictine priory, his father intending that he be ordained in the Roman Catholic Church. At sixteen, to further his father's intention, he was sent to the University of Caen to read theology.[8]/nAt the university, he was mentored by two enthusiastic teachers of mathematics, Christophe Gadbled and Pierre Le Canu, who awoke his zeal for the subject. Here Laplace's brilliance as a mathematician was quickly recognised and while still at Caen he wrote a memoir Sur le Calcul integral aux differences infiniment petites et aux differences finies. This provided the first intercourse between Laplace and Lagrange. Lagrange was the senior by thirteen years, and had recently founded in his native city Turin a journal named Miscellanea Taurinensia, in which many of his early works were printed and it was in the fourth volume of this series that Laplace's paper appeared. About this time, recognising that he had no vocation for the priesthood, he resolved to become a professional mathematician. Some sources state that he then broke with the church and became an atheist.[citation needed]  Laplace did not graduate in theology but left for Paris with a letter of introduction from Le Canu to Jean le Rond d'Alembert who at that time was supreme in scientific circles.[8][9]/nAccording to his great-great-grandson,[6] d'Alembert received him rather poorly, and to get rid of him gave him a thick mathematics book, saying to come back when he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care./nAnother account is that Laplace solved overnight a problem that d'Alembert set him for submission the following week, then solved a harder problem the following night. D'Alembert was impressed and recommended him for a teaching place in the \u00c9cole Militaire.[10]/nWith a secure income and undemanding teaching, Laplace now threw himself into original research and for the next seventeen years, 1771\u20131787, he produced much of his original work in astronomy.[11]/nFrom 1780 to 1784, Laplace and French chemist Antoine Lavoisier collaborated on several experimental investigations, designing their own equipment for the task.[12] \nIn 1783 they published their joint paper, Memoir on Heat, in which they discussed the kinetic theory of molecular motion.[13]\nIn their experiments they measured the specific heat of various bodies, and the expansion of metals with increasing temperature. They also measured the boiling points of ethanol and ether under pressure./nLaplace further impressed the Marquis de Condorcet, and already by 1771 Laplace felt entitled to membership in the French Academy of Sciences. However, that year admission went to Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde and in 1772 to Jacques Antoine Joseph Cousin. Laplace was disgruntled, and early in 1773 d'Alembert wrote to Lagrange in Berlin to ask if a position could be found for Laplace there. However, Condorcet became permanent secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie in February and Laplace was elected associate member on 31 March, at age\u00a024.[14] In 1773 Laplace read his paper on the invariability of planetary motion in front of the Academy des Sciences. That March he was elected to the academy, a place where he conducted the majority of his science.[15]/nOn 15 March 1788,[16][6] at the age of thirty-nine, Laplace married Marie-Charlotte de Courty de Romanges, an eighteen-year-old girl from a \"good\" family in Besan\u00e7on.[17] The wedding was celebrated at Saint-Sulpice, Paris. The couple had a son, Charles-\u00c9mile (1789\u20131874), and a daughter, Sophie-Suzanne (1792\u20131813).[18][19]/nLaplace's early published work in 1771 started with differential equations and finite differences but he was already starting to think about the mathematical and philosophical concepts of probability and statistics.[20] However, before his election to the Acad\u00e9mie in 1773, he had already drafted two papers that would establish his reputation. The first, M\u00e9moire sur la probabilit\u00e9 des causes par les \u00e9v\u00e9nements was ultimately published in 1774 while the second paper, published in 1776, further elaborated his statistical thinking and also began his systematic work on celestial mechanics and the stability of the Solar System. The two disciplines would always be interlinked in his mind. \"Laplace took probability as an instrument for repairing defects in knowledge.\"[21] Laplace's work on probability and statistics is discussed below with his mature work on the analytic theory of probabilities./nSir Isaac Newton had published his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 in which he gave a derivation of Kepler's laws, which describe the motion of the planets, from his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning, unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace's scientific life.[22] It is now generally regarded that Laplace's methods on their own, though vital to the development of the theory, are not sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability of the Solar System,[23] and indeed, the Solar System is understood to be chaotic, although it happens to be fairly stable./nOne particular problem from observational astronomy was the apparent instability whereby Jupiter's orbit appeared to be shrinking while that of Saturn was expanding. The problem had been tackled by Leonhard Euler in 1748 and Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1763 but without success.[24] In 1776, Laplace published a memoir in which he first explored the possible influences of a purported luminiferous ether or of a law of gravitation that did not act instantaneously. He ultimately returned to an intellectual investment in Newtonian gravity.[25] Euler and Lagrange had made a practical approximation by ignoring small terms in the equations of motion. Laplace noted that though the terms themselves were small, when integrated over time they could become important. Laplace carried his analysis into the higher-order terms, up to and including the cubic. Using this more exact analysis, Laplace concluded that any two planets and the Sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his work on the stability of the Solar System.[26] Gerald James Whitrow described the achievement as \"the most important advance in physical astronomy since Newton\".[22]/nLaplace had a wide knowledge of all sciences and dominated all discussions in the Acad\u00e9mie.[27] Laplace seems to have regarded analysis merely as a means of attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he took but little trouble to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for him if he could by any means solve the particular question he was discussing.[11]/nWhile Newton explained the tides by describing the tide-generating forces and Bernoulli gave a description of the static reaction of the waters on Earth to the tidal potential, the dynamic theory of tides, developed by Laplace in 1775,[28] describes the ocean's real reaction to tidal forces.[29] Laplace's theory of ocean tides took into account friction, resonance and natural periods of ocean basins. It predicted the large amphidromic systems in the world's ocean basins and explains the oceanic tides that are actually observed.[30][31]/nThe equilibrium theory, based on the gravitational gradient from the Sun and Moon but ignoring the Earth's rotation, the effects of continents, and other important effects, could not explain the real ocean tides.[32][33][34][30][35][36][37][38][39]/nSince measurements have confirmed the theory, many things have possible explanations now, like how the tides interact with deep sea ridges and chains of seamounts give rise to deep eddies that transport nutrients from the deep to the surface.[40] The equilibrium tide theory calculates the height of the tide wave of less than half a meter, while the dynamic theory explains why tides are up to 15 meters.[41] Satellite observations confirm the accuracy of the dynamic theory, and the tides worldwide are now measured to within a few centimeters.[42][43] Measurements from the CHAMP satellite closely match the models based on the TOPEX data.[44][45][46] Accurate models of tides worldwide are essential for research since the variations due to tides must be removed from measurements when calculating gravity and changes in sea levels.[47]/nIn 1776, Laplace formulated a single set of linear partial differential equations, for tidal flow described as a barotropic two-dimensional sheet flow. Coriolis effects are introduced as well as lateral forcing by gravity. Laplace obtained these equations by simplifying the fluid dynamic equations. But they can also be derived from energy integrals via Lagrange's equation./nFor a fluid sheet of average thickness D, the vertical tidal elevation \u03b6, as well as the horizontal velocity components u and v (in the latitude \u03c6 and longitude \u03bb directions, respectively) satisfy Laplace's tidal equations:[48]/nwhere \u03a9 is the angular frequency of the planet's rotation, g is the planet's gravitational acceleration at the mean ocean surface, a is the planetary radius, and U is the external gravitational tidal-forcing potential./nWilliam Thomson (Lord Kelvin) rewrote Laplace's momentum terms using the curl to find an equation for vorticity. Under certain conditions this can be further rewritten as a conservation of vorticity./nDuring the years 1784\u20131787 he published some papers of exceptional power. Prominent among these is one read in 1783, reprinted as Part II of Th\u00e9orie du Mouvement et de la figure elliptique des plan\u00e8tes in 1784, and in the third volume of the M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste. In this work, Laplace completely determined the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is memorable for the introduction into analysis of spherical harmonics or Laplace's coefficients, and also for the development of the use of what we would now call the gravitational potential in celestial mechanics./nIn 1783, in a paper sent to the Acad\u00e9mie, Adrien-Marie Legendre had introduced what are now known as associated Legendre functions.[11] If two points in a plane have polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) and (r ', \u03b8'), where r ' \u2265 r, then, by elementary manipulation, the reciprocal of the distance between the points, d, can be written as:/nThis expression can be expanded in powers of r/r ' using Newton's generalised binomial theorem to give:/nThe sequence of functions P0k(cos \u03c6) is the set of so-called \"associated Legendre functions\" and their usefulness arises from the fact that every function of the points on a circle can be expanded as a series of them.[11]/nLaplace, with scant regard for credit to Legendre, made the non-trivial extension of the result to three dimensions to yield a more general set of functions, the spherical harmonics or Laplace coefficients. The latter term is not in common use now.[11]\n:\u200ap. 340ff/nThis paper is also remarkable for the development of the idea of the scalar potential.[11] The gravitational force acting on a body is, in modern language, a vector, having magnitude and direction. A potential function is a scalar function that defines how the vectors will behave. A scalar function is computationally and conceptually easier to deal with than a vector function./nAlexis Clairaut had first suggested the idea in 1743 while working on a similar problem though he was using Newtonian-type geometric reasoning. Laplace described Clairaut's work as being \"in the class of the most beautiful mathematical productions\".[49] However, Rouse Ball alleges that the idea \"was appropriated from Joseph Louis Lagrange, who had used it in his memoirs of 1773, 1777 and 1780\".[11] The term \"potential\" itself was due to Daniel Bernoulli, who introduced it in his 1738 memoire Hydrodynamica. However, according to Rouse Ball, the term \"potential function\" was not actually used (to refer to a function V of the coordinates of space in Laplace's sense) until George Green's 1828 An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism.[50][51]/nLaplace applied the language of calculus to the potential function and showed that it always satisfies the differential equation:[11]/nAn analogous result for the velocity potential of a fluid had been obtained some years previously by Leonhard Euler.[52][53]/nLaplace's subsequent work on gravitational attraction was based on this result. The quantity \u22072V has been termed the concentration of V and its value at any point indicates the \"excess\" of the value of V there over its mean value in the neighbourhood of the point.[54] Laplace's equation, a special case of Poisson's equation, appears ubiquitously in mathematical physics. The concept of a potential occurs in fluid dynamics, electromagnetism and other areas. Rouse Ball speculated that it might be seen as \"the outward sign\" of one of the a priori forms in Kant's theory of perception.[11]/nThe spherical harmonics turn out to be critical to practical solutions of Laplace's equation. Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates, such as are used for mapping the sky, can be simplified, using the method of separation of variables into a radial part, depending solely on distance from the centre point, and an angular or spherical part. The solution to the spherical part of the equation can be expressed as a series of Laplace's spherical harmonics, simplifying practical computation./nLaplace presented a memoir on planetary inequalities in three sections, in 1784, 1785, and 1786. This dealt mainly with the identification and explanation of the perturbations now known as the \"great Jupiter\u2013Saturn inequality\". Laplace solved a longstanding problem in the study and prediction of the movements of these planets. He showed by general considerations, first, that the mutual action of two planets could never cause large changes in the eccentricities and inclinations of their orbits; but then, even more importantly, that peculiarities arose in the Jupiter\u2013Saturn system because of the near approach to commensurability of the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.[4][55]/nIn this context commensurability means that the ratio of the two planets' mean motions is very nearly equal to a ratio between a pair of small whole numbers. Two periods of Saturn's orbit around the Sun almost equal five of Jupiter's. The corresponding difference between multiples of the mean motions, (2nJ \u2212 5nS), corresponds to a period of nearly 900\u00a0years, and it occurs as a small divisor in the integration of a very small perturbing force with this same period. As a result, the integrated perturbations with this period are disproportionately large, about 0.8\u00b0 degrees of arc in orbital longitude for Saturn and about 0.3\u00b0 for Jupiter./nFurther developments of these theorems on planetary motion were given in his two memoirs of 1788 and 1789, but with the aid of Laplace's discoveries, the tables of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn could at last be made much more accurate. It was on the basis of Laplace's theory that Delambre computed his astronomical tables.[11]/nLaplace now set himself the task to write a work which should \"offer a complete solution of the great mechanical problem presented by the Solar System, and bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that empirical equations should no longer find a place in astronomical tables.\"[4] The result is embodied in the Exposition du syst\u00e8me du monde and the M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste.[11]/nThe former was published in 1796, and gives a general explanation of the phenomena, but omits all details. It contains a summary of the history of astronomy. This summary procured for its author the honour of admission to the forty of the French Academy and is commonly esteemed one of the masterpieces of French literature, though it is not altogether reliable for the later periods of which it treats.[11]/nLaplace developed the nebular hypothesis of the formation of the Solar System, first suggested by Emanuel Swedenborg and expanded by Immanuel Kant, a hypothesis that continues to dominate accounts of the origin of planetary systems. According to Laplace's description of the hypothesis, the Solar System had evolved from a globular mass of incandescent gas rotating around an axis through its centre of mass. As it cooled, this mass contracted, and successive rings broke off from its outer edge. These rings in their turn cooled, and finally condensed into the planets, while the Sun represented the central core which was still left. On this view, Laplace predicted that the more distant planets would be older than those nearer the Sun.[11][56]/nAs mentioned, the idea of the nebular hypothesis had been outlined by Immanuel Kant in 1755,[56] and he had also suggested \"meteoric aggregations\" and tidal friction as causes affecting the formation of the Solar System. Laplace was probably aware of this, but, like many writers of his time, he generally did not reference the work of others.[6]/nLaplace's analytical discussion of the Solar System is given in his M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste published in five volumes. The first two volumes, published in 1799, contain methods for calculating the motions of the planets, determining their figures, and resolving tidal problems.[4] The third and fourth volumes, published in 1802 and 1805, contain applications of these methods, and several astronomical tables. The fifth volume, published in 1825, is mainly historical, but it gives as appendices the results of Laplace's latest researches. Laplace's own investigations embodied in it are so numerous and valuable that it is regrettable to have to add that many results are appropriated from other writers with scanty or no acknowledgement, and the conclusions\u00a0\u2014 which have been described as the organised result of a century of patient toil\u00a0\u2014 are frequently mentioned as if they were due to Laplace.[11]/nJean-Baptiste Biot, who assisted Laplace in revising it for the press, says that Laplace himself was frequently unable to recover the details in the chain of reasoning, and, if satisfied that the conclusions were correct, he was content to insert the constantly recurring formula, \"Il est ais\u00e9 \u00e0 voir que ... \" (\"It is easy to see that ...\"). The M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste is not only the translation of Newton's Principia into the language of the differential calculus, but it completes parts of which Newton had been unable to fill in the details. The work was carried forward in a more finely tuned form in F\u00e9lix Tisserand's Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste (1889\u20131896), but Laplace's treatise will always remain a standard authority.[11]\nIn the years 1784\u20131787, Laplace produced some memoirs of exceptional power. The significant among these was one issued in 1784, and reprinted in the third volume of the M\u00e9chanique c\u00e9leste.[citation needed] In this work he completely determined the attraction of a spheroid on a particle outside it. This is known for the introduction into analysis of the potential, a useful mathematical concept of broad applicability to the physical sciences./nLaplace also came close to propounding the concept of the black hole. He suggested that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not even light could escape from their surface (see escape velocity).[57][1][58][59] However, this insight was so far ahead of its time that it played no role in the history of scientific development.[60]/nIn 1806, Laplace bought a house in Arcueil, then a village and not yet absorbed into the Paris conurbation. The chemist Claude Louis Berthollet was a neighbour \u2013 their gardens were not separated[61] \u2013 and the pair formed the nucleus of an informal scientific circle, latterly known as the Society of Arcueil. Because of their closeness to Napoleon, Laplace and Berthollet effectively controlled advancement in the scientific establishment and admission to the more prestigious offices. The Society built up a complex pyramid of patronage.[62] In 1806, Laplace was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences./nIn 1812, Laplace issued his Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s in which he laid down many fundamental results in statistics. The first half of this treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half with statistical methods and applications. Laplace's proofs are not always rigorous according to the standards of a later day, and his perspective slides back and forth between the Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes astray.[63] In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability. This book bears the same relation to the Th\u00e9orie des probabilit\u00e9s that the Syst\u00e8me du monde does to the M\u00e9chanique c\u00e9leste.[11] In its emphasis on the analytical importance of probabilistic problems, especially in the context of the \"approximation of formula functions of large numbers,\" Laplace's work goes beyond the contemporary view which almost exclusively considered aspects of practical applicability.[64] Laplace's Th\u00e9orie analytique remained the most influential book of mathematical probability theory to the end of the 19th century. The general relevance for statistics of Laplacian error theory was appreciated only by the end of the 19th century. However, it influenced the further development of a largely analytically oriented probability theory./nIn his Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s (1814), Laplace set out a mathematical system of inductive reasoning based on probability, which we would today recognise as Bayesian. He begins the text with a series of principles of probability, the first seven being:/nOne well-known formula arising from his system is the rule of succession, given as principle seven. Suppose that some trial has only two possible outcomes, labelled \"success\" and \"failure\". Under the assumption that little or nothing is known a priori about the relative plausibilities of the outcomes, Laplace derived a formula for the probability that the next trial will be a success./nwhere s is the number of previously observed successes and n is the total number of observed trials. It is still used as an estimator for the probability of an event if we know the event space, but have only a small number of samples./nThe rule of succession has been subject to much criticism, partly due to the example which Laplace chose to illustrate it. He calculated that the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow, given that it has never failed to in the past, was/nwhere d is the number of times the sun has risen in the past. This result has been derided as absurd, and some authors have concluded that all applications of the Rule of Succession are absurd by extension. However, Laplace was fully aware of the absurdity of the result; immediately following the example, he wrote, \"But this number [i.e., the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow] is far greater for him who, seeing in the totality of phenomena the principle regulating the days and seasons, realizes that nothing at the present moment can arrest the course of it.\"[65]/nThe method of estimating the ratio of the number of favourable cases to the whole number of possible cases had been previously indicated by Laplace in a paper written in 1779. It consists of treating the successive values of any function as the coefficients in the expansion of another function, with reference to a different variable.[4] The latter is therefore called the probability-generating function of the former.[4] Laplace then shows how, by means of interpolation, these coefficients may be determined from the generating function. Next he attacks the converse problem, and from the coefficients he finds the generating function; this is effected by the solution of a finite difference equation.[11]/nThe fourth chapter of this treatise includes an exposition of the method of least squares, a remarkable testimony to Laplace's command over the processes of analysis. In 1805 Legendre had published the method of least squares, making no attempt to tie it to the theory of probability. In 1809 Gauss had derived the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then, turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works seem to have spurred Laplace to complete work toward a treatise on probability he had contemplated as early as 1783.[63]/nIn two important papers in 1810 and 1811, Laplace first developed the characteristic function as a tool for large-sample theory and proved the first general central limit theorem. Then in a supplement to his 1810 paper written after he had seen Gauss's work, he showed that the central limit theorem provided a Bayesian justification for least squares: if one were combining observations, each one of which was itself the mean of a large number of independent observations, then the least squares estimates would not only maximise the likelihood function, considered as a posterior distribution, but also minimise the expected posterior error, all this without any assumption as to the error distribution or a circular appeal to the principle of the arithmetic mean.[63] In 1811 Laplace took a different non-Bayesian tack. Considering a linear regression problem, he restricted his attention to linear unbiased estimators of the linear coefficients. After showing that members of this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the \"best\" linear estimators. Here it is \"best\" in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution. His derivation included the joint limiting distribution of the least squares estimators of two parameters.[63]/nIn 1814, Laplace published what may have been the first scientific articulation of causal determinism:[66]/nWe may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be the present to it./nThis intellect is often referred to as Laplace's demon (in the same vein as Maxwell's demon) and sometimes Laplace's Superman (after Hans Reichenbach). Laplace, himself, did not use the word \"demon\", which was a later embellishment. As translated into English above, he simply referred to: \"Une intelligence ... Rien ne serait incertain pour elle, et l'avenir comme le pass\u00e9, serait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 ses yeux.\"/nEven though Laplace is generally credited with having first formulated the concept of causal determinism, in a philosophical context the idea was actually widespread at the time, and can be found as early as 1756 in Maupertuis' 'Sur la Divination'.[68] As well, Jesuit scientist Boscovich first proposed a version of scientific determinism very similar to Laplace's in his 1758 book Theoria philosophiae naturalis.[69]/nAs early as 1744, Euler, followed by Lagrange, had started looking for solutions of differential equations in the form:[70]/nThe Laplace transform has the form:/nThis integral operator transforms a function of time (\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t}\n\n) into a function of a complex variable (\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n), usually interpreted as complex frequency./nAmong the other discoveries of Laplace in pure and applied mathematics are:/nLaplace built upon the qualitative work of Thomas Young to develop the theory of capillary action and the Young\u2013Laplace equation./nLaplace in 1816 was the first to point out that the speed of sound in air depends on the heat capacity ratio. Newton's original theory gave too low a value, because it does not take account of the adiabatic compression of the air which results in a local rise in temperature and pressure. Laplace's investigations in practical physics were confined to those carried on by him jointly with Lavoisier in the years 1782 to 1784 on the specific heat of various bodies.[11]/nIn his early years, Laplace was careful never to become involved in politics, or indeed in life outside the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. He prudently withdrew from Paris during the most violent part of the Revolution.[71]/nIn November 1799, immediately after seizing power in the coup of 18 Brumaire, Napoleon appointed Laplace to the post of Minister of the Interior.[4] The appointment, however, lasted only six weeks, after which Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother, was given the post.[4] Evidently, once Napoleon's grip on power was secure, there was no need for a prestigious but inexperienced scientist in the government.[72] Napoleon later (in his M\u00e9moires de Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne) wrote of Laplace's dismissal as follows:[11]/nGeometrician of the first rank, Laplace was not long in showing himself a worse than average administrator; from his first actions in office we recognized our mistake. Laplace did not consider any question from the right angle: he sought subtleties everywhere, conceived only problems, and finally carried the spirit of \"infinitesimals\" into the administration./nGrattan-Guinness, however, describes these remarks as \"tendentious\", since there seems to be no doubt that Laplace \"was only appointed as a short-term figurehead, a place-holder while Napoleon consolidated power\".[72]/nAlthough Laplace was removed from office, it was desirable to retain his allegiance. He was accordingly raised to the senate, and to the third volume of the M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste he prefixed a note that of all the truths therein contained the most precious to the author was the declaration he thus made of his devotion towards the peacemaker of Europe.[4] In copies sold after the Bourbon Restoration this was struck out. (Pearson points out that the censor would not have allowed it anyway.) In 1814 it was evident that the empire was falling; Laplace hastened to tender his services to the Bourbons, and in 1817 during the Restoration he was rewarded with the title of marquis./nAccording to Rouse Ball, the contempt that his more honest colleagues felt for his conduct in the matter may be read in the pages of Paul Louis Courier. His knowledge was useful on the numerous scientific commissions on which he served, and, says Rouse Ball, probably accounts for the manner in which his political insincerity was overlooked.[11]/nRoger Hahn in his 2005 biography disputes this portrayal of Laplace as an opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he had followed the debacle of Napoleon's Russian campaign with serious misgivings. The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear for the safety of their son \u00c9mile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but it was clear that he had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: \"On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [Napoleon] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh! I see that you have grown thin\u2014Sire, I have lost my daughter\u2014Oh! that's not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.'\"[73]/nIn the second edition (1814) of the Essai philosophique, Laplace added some revealing comments on politics and governance. Since it is, he says, \"the practice of the eternal principles of reason, justice and humanity that produce and preserve societies, there is a great advantage to adhere to these principles, and a great inadvisability to deviate from them\".[74][75] Noting \"the depths of misery into which peoples have been cast\" when ambitious leaders disregard these principles, Laplace makes a veiled criticism of Napoleon's conduct: \"Every time a great power intoxicated by the love of conquest aspires to universal domination, the sense of liberty among the unjustly threatened nations breeds a coalition to which it always succumbs.\" Laplace argues that \"in the midst of the multiple causes that direct and restrain various states, natural limits\" operate, within which it is \"important for the stability as well as the prosperity of empires to remain\". States that transgress these limits cannot avoid being \"reverted\" to them, \"just as is the case when the waters of the seas whose floor has been lifted by violent tempests sink back to their level by the action of gravity\".[76][77]/nAbout the political upheavals he had witnessed, Laplace formulated a set of principles derived from physics to favour evolutionary over revolutionary change:/nLet us apply to the political and moral sciences the method founded upon observation and calculation, which has served us so well in the natural sciences. Let us not offer fruitless and often injurious resistance to the inevitable benefits derived from the progress of enlightenment; but let us change our institutions and the usages that we have for a long time adopted only with extreme caution. We know from past experience the drawbacks they can cause, but we are unaware of the extent of ills that change may produce. In the face of this ignorance, the theory of probability instructs us to avoid all change, especially to avoid sudden changes which in the moral as well as the physical world never occur without a considerable loss of vital force.[78]/nIn these lines, Laplace expressed the views he had arrived at after experiencing the Revolution and the Empire. He believed that the stability of nature, as revealed through scientific findings, provided the model that best helped to preserve the human species. \"Such views,\" Hahn comments, \"were also of a piece with his steadfast character.\"[77]/nIn the Essai philosophique, Laplace also illustrates the potential of probabilities in political studies by applying the law of large numbers to justify the candidates\u2019 integer-valued ranks used in the Borda method of voting, with which the new members of the Academy of Sciences were elected. Laplace\u2019s verbal argument is so rigorous that it can easily be converted into a formal proof.[79][80]/nLaplace died in Paris on 5 March 1827, which was the same day Alessandro Volta died. His brain was removed by his physician, Fran\u00e7ois Magendie, and kept for many years, eventually being displayed in a roving anatomical museum in Britain. It was reportedly smaller than the average brain.[6] Laplace was buried at P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris but in 1888 his remains were moved to Saint Julien de Mailloc in the canton of Orbec and reinterred on the family estate.[81] The tomb is situated on a hill overlooking the village of St Julien de Mailloc, Normandy, France./nA frequently cited but potentially apocryphal interaction between Laplace and Napoleon purportedly concerns the existence of God. Although the conversation in question did occur, the exact words Laplace used and his intended meaning are not known. A typical version is provided by Rouse Ball:[11]/nLaplace went in state to Napoleon to present a copy of his work, and the following account of the interview is well authenticated, and so characteristic of all the parties concerned that I quote it in full. Someone had told Napoleon that the book contained no mention of the name of God; Napoleon, who was fond of putting embarrassing questions, received it with the remark, 'M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.' Laplace, who, though the most supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on every point of his philosophy, drew himself up and answered bluntly, Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypoth\u00e8se-l\u00e0. (\"I had no need of that hypothesis.\") Napoleon, greatly amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed, Ah! c'est une belle hypoth\u00e8se; \u00e7a explique beaucoup de choses. (\"Ah, it is a fine hypothesis; it explains many things.\")/nAn earlier report, although without the mention of Laplace's name, is found in Antommarchi's The Last Moments of Napoleon (1825):[82]/nJe m'entretenais avec L ..... je le f\u00e9licitais d'un ouvrage qu'il venait de publier et lui demandais comment le nom de Dieu, qui se reproduisait sans cesse sous la plume de Lagrange, ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une seule fois sous la sienne.  C'est, me r\u00e9pondit-il, que je n'ai pas eu besoin de cette hypoth\u00e8se.  (\"While speaking with L ..... I congratulated him on a work which he had just published and asked him how the name of God, which appeared endlessly in the works of Lagrange, didn't occur even once in his.  He replied that he had no need of that hypothesis.\")/nIn 1884, however, the astronomer Herv\u00e9 Faye[83][84] affirmed that this account of Laplace's exchange with Napoleon presented a \"strangely transformed\" (\u00e9trangement transform\u00e9e) or garbled version of what had actually happened. It was not God that Laplace had treated as a hypothesis, but merely his intervention at a determinate point:/nIn fact Laplace never said that. Here, I believe, is what truly happened. Newton, believing that the secular perturbations which he had sketched out in his theory would in the long run end up destroying the Solar System, says somewhere that God was obliged to intervene from time to time to remedy the evil and somehow keep the system working properly. This, however, was a pure supposition suggested to Newton by an incomplete view of the conditions of the stability of our little world. Science was not yet advanced enough at that time to bring these conditions into full view. But Laplace, who had discovered them by a deep analysis, would have replied to the First Consul that Newton had wrongly invoked the intervention of God to adjust from time to time the machine of the world (la machine du monde) and that he, Laplace, had no need of such an assumption. It was not God, therefore, that Laplace treated as a hypothesis, but his intervention in a certain place./nLaplace's younger colleague, the astronomer Fran\u00e7ois Arago, who gave his eulogy before the French Academy in 1827,[85] told Faye of an attempt by Laplace to keep the garbled version of his interaction with Napoleon out of circulation. Faye writes:[83][84]/nI have it on the authority of M. Arago that Laplace, warned shortly before his death that that anecdote was about to be published in a biographical collection, had requested him [Arago] to demand its deletion by the publisher. It was necessary to either explain or delete it, and the second way was the easiest. But, unfortunately, it was neither deleted nor explained./nThe Swiss-American historian of mathematics Florian Cajori appears to have been unaware of Faye's research, but in 1893 he came to a similar conclusion.[86] Stephen Hawking said in 1999,[66] \"I don't think that Laplace was claiming that God does not exist. It's just that he doesn't intervene, to break the laws of Science.\"/nThe only eyewitness account of Laplace's interaction with Napoleon is from the entry for 8 August 1802 in the diary of the British astronomer Sir William Herschel:[87]/nThe first Consul then asked a few questions relating to Astronomy and the construction of the heavens to which I made such answers as seemed to give him great satisfaction. He also addressed himself to Mr Laplace on the same subject, and held a considerable argument with him in which he differed from that eminent mathematician. The difference was occasioned by an exclamation of the first Consul, who asked in a tone of exclamation or admiration (when we were speaking of the extent of the sidereal heavens): 'And who is the author of all this!' Mons. De la Place wished to shew that a chain of natural causes would account for the construction and preservation of the wonderful system. This the first Consul rather opposed. Much may be said on the subject; by joining the arguments of both we shall be led to 'Nature and nature's God'./nSince this makes no mention of Laplace's saying, \"I had no need of that hypothesis,\" Daniel Johnson[88] argues that \"Laplace never used the words attributed to him.\" Arago's testimony, however, appears to imply that he did, only not in reference to the existence of God./nRaised a Catholic, Laplace appears in adult life to have inclined to deism (presumably his considered position, since it is the only one found in his writings). However, some of his contemporaries thought he was an atheist, while a number of recent scholars have described him as agnostic./nFaye thought that Laplace \"did not profess atheism\",[83] but Napoleon, on Saint Helena, told General Gaspard Gourgaud, \"I often asked Laplace what he thought of God. He owned that he was an atheist.\"[89] Roger Hahn, in his biography of Laplace, mentions a dinner party at which \"the geologist Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard was staggered by Laplace's bold denunciation of the existence of God\". It appeared to Guettard that Laplace's atheism \"was supported by a thoroughgoing materialism\".[90] But the chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, who knew Laplace well in the 1820s, wrote that Laplace \"provided materialists with their specious arguments, without sharing their convictions\".[91][92]/nHahn states: \"Nowhere in his writings, either public or private, does Laplace deny God's existence.\"[93] Expressions occur in his private letters that appear inconsistent with atheism.[4] On 17 June 1809, for instance, he wrote to his son, \"Je prie Dieu qu'il veille sur tes jours. Aie-Le toujours pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 ta pens\u00e9e, ainsi que ton p\u00e8re et ta m\u00e8re [I pray that God watches over your days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your mother].\"[84][94] Ian S. Glass, quoting Herschel's account of the celebrated exchange with Napoleon, writes that Laplace was \"evidently a deist like Herschel\".[95]/nIn Exposition du syst\u00e8me du monde, Laplace quotes Newton's assertion that \"the wondrous disposition of the Sun, the planets and the comets, can only be the work of an all-powerful and intelligent Being\".[96] This, says Laplace, is a \"thought in which he [Newton] would be even more confirmed, if he had known what we have shown, namely that the conditions of the arrangement of the planets and their satellites are precisely those which ensure its stability\".[97] By showing that the \"remarkable\" arrangement of the planets could be entirely explained by the laws of motion, Laplace had eliminated the need for the \"supreme intelligence\" to intervene, as Newton had \"made\" it do.[98] Laplace cites with approval Leibniz's criticism of Newton's invocation of divine intervention to restore order to the Solar System: \"This is to have very narrow ideas about the wisdom and the power of God.\"[99] He evidently shared Leibniz's astonishment at Newton's belief \"that God has made his machine so badly that unless he affects it by some extraordinary means, the watch will very soon cease to go\".[100]/nIn a group of manuscripts, preserved in relative secrecy in a black envelope in the library of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences and published for the first time by Hahn, Laplace mounted a deist critique of Christianity. It is, he writes, the \"first and most infallible of principles ... to reject miraculous facts as untrue\".[101] As for the doctrine of transubstantiation, it \"offends at the same time reason, experience, the testimony of all our senses, the eternal laws of nature, and the sublime ideas that we ought to form of the Supreme Being\". It is the sheerest absurdity to suppose that \"the sovereign lawgiver of the universe would suspend the laws that he has established, and which he seems to have maintained invariably\".[102]/nLaplace also ridiculed the use of probability in theology. Even following Pascal's reasoning presented in Pascal's wager, it is not worth making a bet, for the hope of profit \u2013 equal to the product of the value of the testimonies (infinitely small) and the value of the happiness they promise (which is significant but finite) \u2013 must necessarily be infinitely small.[103]/nIn old age, Laplace remained curious about the question of God[104] and frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Th\u00e9odore Maurice.[105] He told Maurice that \"Christianity is quite a beautiful thing\" and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit of supernatural events.[104] After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, \"You know that I do not share your [religious] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you.\" When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his \"brilliant discoveries\", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, \"Ah! We chase after phantoms [chim\u00e8res].\"[106] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate \"vanity\" of earthly pursuits.[107] Laplace received the last rites from the cur\u00e9 of the Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res (in whose parish he was to be buried)[92] and the cur\u00e9 of Arcueil.[107]/nAccording to his biographer, Roger Hahn, it is \"not credible\" that Laplace \"had a proper Catholic end\", and he \"remained a skeptic\" to the very end of his life.[108] Laplace in his last years has been described as an agnostic.[109][110][111]/nIn 1470 the humanist scholar Bartolomeo Platina wrote[112] that Pope Callixtus III had asked for prayers for deliverance from the Turks during a 1456 appearance of Halley's Comet. Platina's account does not accord with Church records, which do not mention the comet. Laplace is alleged to have embellished the story by claiming the Pope had \"excommunicated\" Halley's comet.[113] What Laplace actually said, in Exposition du syst\u00e8me du monde (1796), was that the Pope had ordered the comet to be \"exorcised\" (conjur\u00e9). It was Arago, in Des Com\u00e8tes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (1832), who first spoke of an excommunication.[114][115][116]", "61522640": "Jean-Pierre Gazeau (born 10 October 1945) is a French physicist and mathematician who works in the field of symmetry in quantum physics.[1] His research has focused on coherent states; beta numeration for quasicrystals, and more generally for aperiodic order; and de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space times.

His name is associated with the University of Buenos Aires, but first and foremost with the University of Chicago, where Calder\u00f3n and his mentor, the analyst Antoni Zygmund, developed the theory of singular integral operators.[1][2][3][4] This created the \"Chicago School of (hard) Analysis\" (sometimes simply known as the \"Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund School\").[1][2][4][5][6]/nCalder\u00f3n's work ranged over a wide variety of topics: from singular integral operators to partial differential equations, from interpolation theory to Cauchy integrals on Lipschitz curves, from ergodic theory to inverse problems in electrical prospection.[1][3] Calder\u00f3n's work has also had a powerful impact on practical applications including signal processing, geophysics, and tomography.[1][3]/nAlberto Pedro Calder\u00f3n was born on September 14, 1920, in Mendoza, Argentina, to Don Pedro Calder\u00f3n, a physician (urologist), and Hayd\u00e9e. He had several siblings, including a younger brother, Calixto Pedro Calder\u00f3n, also a mathematician. His father encouraged his mathematical studies. After his mother's unexpected death when he was twelve, he spent two years at the Montana Knabeninstitut, a boys' boarding school near Z\u00fcrich in Switzerland, where he was mentored by Save Bercovici, who interested him in mathematics. He then completed his high school studies in Mendoza.[citation needed]/nPersuaded by his father that he could not make a living as a mathematician, he entered the University of Buenos Aires, where he studied engineering. After graduating in civil engineering in 1947, he got a job in the research laboratory of the geophysical division of the state-owned oil company, the YPF (Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales).[citation needed]/nWhile still working at YPF, Calder\u00f3n became acquainted with the mathematicians at the University of Buenos Aires: Julio Rey Pastor, the first professor in the Institute of Mathematics, his assistant Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Dom\u00ednguez (who became his mentor and friend), Luis Santal\u00f3 and Manuel Balanzat. At the YPF Lab Calder\u00f3n studied the possibility of determining the conductivity of a body by making electrical measurements at the boundary; he did not publish his results until 1980, in his short Brazilian paper.[7] see also On an inverse boundary value problem and the Commentary by Gunther Uhlmann.[8] It pioneered a new area of mathematical research in inverse problems./nCalder\u00f3n then took up a post at the University of Buenos Aires. Antoni Zygmund of the University of Chicago, arrived there in 1948 at the invitation of Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Dom\u00ednguez and Calder\u00f3n was assigned as his assistant. Zygmund invited Calder\u00f3n to work with him, and in 1949 Calder\u00f3n arrived in Chicago with a Rockefeller Fellowship. He was encouraged by Marshall Stone to obtain a doctorate, and with three recently published papers as dissertation, Calder\u00f3n obtained his PhD in mathematics under Zygmund's supervision in 1950./nThe collaboration reached fruition in the Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund theory of singular integrals, and lasted more than three decades. The memoir of 1952[9] was influential for the Chicago School of hard analysis. The Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund decomposition lemma, invented to prove the weak-type continuity of singular integrals of integrable functions, became a standard tool in analysis and probability theory. The Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund Seminar at the University of Chicago ran for decades./nCalder\u00f3n contributed to the theory of differential equations, with his proof of uniqueness in the Cauchy problem[10] using algebras of singular integral operators, his reduction of elliptic boundary value problems to singular integral equations on the boundary (the \"method of the Calder\u00f3n projector\"),[11] and the role played by algebras of singular integrals, through the work of Calder\u00f3n's student R. Seeley, in the initial proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem,[12] see also the Commentary by Paul Malliavin.[8] The development of pseudo-differential operators by Kohn-Nirenberg and H\u00f6rmander also owed much to Calder\u00f3n and his collaborators, R. Vaillancourt and J. Alvarez-Alonso./nAlso, Calder\u00f3n insisted that the focus should be on algebras of singular integral operators with non-smooth kernels to solve actual problems arising in physics and engineering, where lack of smoothness is a natural feature. It led to what is now known as the \"Calder\u00f3n program\", with major parts: Calder\u00f3n's study of the Cauchy integral on Lipschitz curves,[13] and his proof of the boundedness of the \"first commutator\".[14] These papers stimulated research by other mathematicians in the following decades; see also the later paper by the Calder\u00f3n brothers[8][15] and the Commentary by Y. Meyer.[8]/nWork by Calder\u00f3n in interpolation theory opened up a new area of research,[16] see also the Commentary by Charles Fefferman and Elias M. Stein,[8] and in ergodic theory, his basic paper[17] (see also the Commentary by Donald L. Burkholder,[8] and[18]) formulated a transference principle that reduced the proof of maximal inequalities for abstract dynamical systems to the case of the dynamical system on the integers, on the reals or, more generally, on the acting group./nIn his academic career, Calder\u00f3n taught at many different universities, but primarily at the University of Chicago and the University of Buenos Aires. Calder\u00f3n together with his mentor and collaborator Zygmund, maintained close ties with Argentina and Spain, and through their doctoral students and their visits, strongly influenced the development of mathematics in these countries.[8]/nHe was also visiting professor at universities including the University of Buenos Aires, Cornell University, Stanford University, National University of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, University of Paris (Sorbonne), Aut\u00f3noma and Complutense Universities, Madrid, University of Rome and G\u00f6ttingen University./nCalder\u00f3n was recognized internationally for his outstanding contributions to Mathematics as attested to by his numerous prizes and membership in various academies.[1][3]  He gave many invited addresses to universities and learned societies.

In 2007, the Inverse Problems International Association (IPIA) instituted the Calder\u00f3n Prize, named in honor of Alberto P.

From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the spectral graph theory to the future graph theorist./nSpectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Historically, algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. Her work initiated a geometric approach to spectral graph theory  with connections to differential geometry. According to the biography Fan Rong K Chung Graham, \"Spectral graph theory studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties.\"./nIn 1997, the American Mathematical Society published Chung's book Spectral graph theory. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study Spectral graph theory for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung's study in the spectral graph theory brings this \u201calgebraic connectivity\u201d of graphs into a new and higher level.[4]/nFan Chung's work in random graph models shed new light on the field of network science. Many real-world large information networks (such as Internet Graphs, Call Graphs, and Collaboration Graphs, etc.) have been observed to be well approximated by a power law distribution. Fan Chung's work in the Chung-Lu model, pioneered the theory of treating random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, including the power law graphs. Her work provides a solid framework for quantitative and rigorous analysis for modeling and analyzing large complex networks. It also often serves as a popular benchmark for comparing new graph models in network science./nIn 2006, the American Mathematics Society and the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences co-published Fan Chung and Linyuan Lu's book Complex Graphs and Networks.[13] The book gave a well-structured exposition for using combinatorial, probabilistic, spectral methods as well as other new and improved tools to analyze real-world large information networks./nFan Chung, together with Ronald Graham and Richard Wilson, introduced a strong notion of equivalence among graph properties through the control of error bounds and developed the theory of quasi-random graphs. In a series of research papers (with several coauthors), she showed that a large family of graph properties is equivalent in the sense that if a graph satisfies any one of the properties, it must satisfy all of them. The set of equivalent quasi-random properties includes a surprisingly diverse collection of properties, and therefore provides efficient methods for validating graph properties. Many (but not all)  random graph properties are quasi-random. The notion of quasi-randomness has been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs  and graph limits.  In general, the theory of quasi-randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives./nA basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with Paul Erd\u0151s, Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.", "15418147": "Hansraj Gupta (9 October 1902 \u2013 23 November 1988) was an Indian mathematician specialising in number theory, in particular the study of the partition function./nGupta was born 9 October 1902 in Rawalpindi, then part of British India.

He also published several papers giving simple but insightful geometric derivations for the Lorentz transformations.[3]/nAfter his return to Madras (Chennai) from the Institute for Advanced Study in 1958, Ramakrishnan began a Theoretical Physics Seminar in his family home Ekamra Nivas (house with a mango tree). In the seminar he presented lectures on the latest advances in theoretical physics to a small group of students, and invited leading scientists from the world to address the students. In 1960, nobel laureate Niels Bohr visited India and was impressed by the small group of students trained by Ramakrishnan.[3] While in India, Bohr visited Dr. Ramakrishnan's family home, and inspired the creation of an institute for advanced research.[3][4] With Bohr's recommendation and with support from the then prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru and C.Subramaniam, Alladi Ramakrishan set out to create the institute. Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Matscience) was thus created in 1962 with Ramakrishnan as the director. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, nobel laureate and professor at University of Chicago inaugurated the Institute at the Presidency College in the then Madras. Chandrasekhar also agreed to be an Honorary Professor of Astrophysics at the institute and addressed its first students.[5]/nRamakrishnan travelled and lectured extensively during his years at Matscience, holding lectures at over 200 centers of learning. He was unusually generous with providing opportunity and leave for his Ph.D. students to travel to centers of learning abroad, firmly believing that this was of benefit to his students and that research was an international activity, even if this brought with it the risk of losing talented students to other institutions. After retiring, Ramakrishnan continued to teach and inspire. In the last decades of his life, several high school students and undergraduates came to his home in Madras to learn with him, subsequently pursuing higher studies in the United States towards a career of research.[3]/nRamakrishnan was married to Lalitha Ramakrishnan, the daughter of mathematics professor H. Subramani Iyer. His son Krishnaswami Alladi is  a professor of mathematics at the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.[3] Ramakrishnan was a connoisseur of Carnatic music and strongly believed that art and science can go hand in hand.[4] He died on 7 June 2008 at his son's home in Gainesville, Florida.[6]", "38454090": "G.

There, Tangian received his habilitation in general economics in 2008 and professor title in 2009. Basing on this course, Tangian has published two monographs on the mathematical theory of democracy.[9][10]/nCombining the social choice and public choice approaches, Tangian's theory mathematically studies the fundamental concept to modern democracies \u2013 that of political representation.[9][10] For this purpose, several indices of representativeness are introduced and used for both theoretical analysis and applications.[11][12][13]/nThe method developed within the framework of the Mathematical theory of democracy assumes that instead of casting votes for candidates by name, electors give Yes/No-answers to political questions as raised in the candidates' manifestos.[14] The balance of public opinion on these issues thus identified is then used to find the most representative candidates and form the most representative parliament.[15][16][17][18][19]/nFor decision models, Tangian has developed several methods for constructing objective functions (= composite indices that embody decision-makers' preferences).[20][21] In particular, they are applied to optimize budgets for 16 Westphalian universities[22] and the European subsidies to 271 German regions for equalizing unemployment rates.[23]/nTangian's ten empirical models of flexicurity \u2014 the European policy intended to compensate the flexibilization of employment by social security measures \u2014 show that it fails to meet expectations.[8] Alternatively, the job quality indicators developed within this research[24] are proposed for the workplace tax that, by analogy with the green tax, should charge employers for bad working conditions considered \"social pollution\".[25]/nAccording to Tangian, the current rise in inequality is caused, among other things, by the increasing productivity, which enables to underpay workers in so-called \"labor equivalents\", maintaining nevertheless an impression of fair pay, and use the surplus profit to enrich the upper strata of the society.[26]/nThe approach implements Tangian's principle of correlativity of perception for structuring data without knowing the structures, which is based on memory-saving representations.[5][27][28] This model is used for polyphonic voice separation/chord recognition and tempo tracking under variable tempo.[29][30]/nTangian has proposed to segment the musical text with respect to the segment functions and show the segments using tempo envelopes, dynamics and other execution techniques. All of these are displayed in a conditional \"orchestral score\".[31]\nThis idea is also applied to theatrical performance and its notation.[32]/nIn the 2000s, Tangian has developed algorithms for finding rhythmic canons and fugues, i.e. polyphonic structures generated by one or two rhythmic patterns that in their interaction produce a regular pulse train, however, with no coinciding time events from different voices.[33][34][35][36] As harmony algorithms, 2D and 3D proximity maps for major and minor keys and chords have been developed.[37]/nTangian belongs to the Armenian noble family Melik-Tangyan, which is mentioned in Armenian chronicles since the 10th century.[38]\nTangian's father, Sema Tanguiane, was the UNESCO Assistant Director General for Education from 1975 to 1987.

According to this measure, the Borda count is the least inconsistent possible positional voting scheme, while plurality voting is the most inconsistent.[3] However, other voting theorists such as Steven Brams, while agreeing with Saari that plurality voting is a bad system, disagree with his advocacy of the Borda count, because it is too easily manipulated by tactical voting.[4][6] Saari also applies similar methods to a different problem in political science, the apportionment of seats to electoral districts in proportion to their populations.[3] He has written several books on the mathematics of voting.[S94][S95a][S01a][S01b][S08]/nIn economics, Saari has shown that natural price mechanisms that set the rate of change of the price of a commodity proportional to its excess demand can lead to chaotic behavior rather than converging to an economic equilibrium, and has exhibited alternative price mechanisms that can be guaranteed to converge. However, as he also showed, such mechanisms require that the change in price be determined as a function of the whole system of prices and demands, rather than being reducible to a computation over pairs of commodities.[SS][S85][S95b]/nIn celestial mechanics, Saari's work on the n-body problem \"revived the singularity theory\" of Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Paul Painlev\u00e9, and proved Littlewood's conjecture that the initial conditions leading to collisions have measure zero.[7] He also formulated the \"Saari conjecture\", that when a solution to the Newtonian n-body problem has an unchanging moment of inertia relative to its center of mass, its bodies must be in relative equilibrium.[8] More controversially, Saari has taken the position that anomalies in the rotation speeds of galaxies, discovered by Vera Rubin, can be explained by considering more carefully the pairwise gravitational interactions of individual stars instead of approximating the gravitational effects of a galaxy on a star by treating the rest of the galaxy as a continuous mass distribution (or, as Saari calls it, \"star soup\"). In support of this hypothesis, Saari showed that simplified mathematical models of galaxies as systems of large numbers of bodies arranged symmetrically on circular shells could be made to form central configurations that rotate as a rigid body rather than with the outer bodies rotating at the speed predicted by the total mass interior to them. According to his theories, neither dark matter nor modifications to the laws of gravitational force are needed to explain galactic rotation speeds. However, his results do not rule out the existence of dark matter, as they do not address other evidence for dark matter based on gravitational lenses and irregularities in the cosmic microwave background.[9] His works in this area include two more books.[SX][S05]/nOverviewing his work in these diverse areas, Saari has argued that his contributions to them are strongly related. In his view, Arrow's impossibility theorem in voting theory, the failure of simple pricing mechanisms, and the failure of previous analysis to explain the speeds of galactic rotation stem from the same cause: a reductionist approach that divides a complex problem (a multi-candidate election, a market, or a rotating galaxy) into multiple simpler subproblems (two-candidate elections for the Condorcet criterion, two-commodity markets, or the interactions between individual stars and the aggregate mass of the rest of the galaxy) but, in the process, loses information about the initial problem making it impossible to combine the subproblem solutions into an accurate solution to the whole problem.[S15] Saari credits some of his research success to a strategy of mulling over research problems on long road trips, without access to pencil or paper.[10]/nSaari is also known for having some discussion with Theodore J. Kaczynski in 1978, prior to the mail bombings that led to Kaczynski's 1996 arrest.[11]/nSaari grew up in a Finnish American copper mining community in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, the son of two labor organizers there.

Belevitch's father was arrested before he could follow and was deported to Siberia, where he died without ever seeing his son.[1]/nIn 1926 Belevitch, while still a small child, emigrated with his mother to Belgium.[2]/nBelevitch was educated in French in Belgium, until July 1936 at the Notre-Dame de la Paix College at Namur.  In 1937, aged 16, he enrolled at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain where he studied electrical and mechanical engineering, graduating in 1942.[3][4] Belevitch gained his PhD in applied sciences at the same university in 1945.  His sponsor was Charles Lambert Manneback and his second advisor was Wilhelm Cauer, the founder of the field of network synthesis.[5][6]/nFrom 1953 until 1985 Belevitch lectured at the university.  He taught circuit theory and other mathematical subjects related to electrical science.  In 1960 he became a special professor (buitengewoon hoogleraar).[7]  Although Belevitch worked as an electrical engineer, his primary interest was mathematics, especially algebra.  There was a tradition in Belgium of the most gifted mathematicians entering engineering rather than pure mathematics or physics.  Belevitch showed his mathematical leanings by preferring the use of blackboard and chalk to any audio-visual aids during lectures.  He even lectured in this way when presenting the opening lecture to a large audience at an international conference at the IEE in London.[8]/nAfter graduating in 1942, Belevitch joined the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company (BTMC) in Antwerp, originally part of the International Bell Telephone Company headquartered in Brussels but, along with their other European holdings, sold to International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) in 1925.  At BTMC Belevitch became head of the transmission department.  It was here that he came into contact with Wilhelm Cauer who became a great influence on him.  Cauer was one of the leading circuit theorists of the day and at the time worked for Mix & Genest in Berlin, a sister company under the ITT umbrella.  Cauer died during the Second World War but Belevitch long after continued to consider his works to be the highest authority on matters of circuit theory.[9]/nFrom 1951 Belevitch was involved in the design of electronic computers which BTMC were developing for the Belgian government.  The purpose of this program was to \"catch up\" with the advances made in the English-speaking world during the war.  It resulted in the construction of the Machine math\u00e9matique IRSIA-FNRS.[note 1]  From 1952 Belevitch represented the electrical engineering aspect of this project.  In 1955 Belevitch became director of the Belgian Computing Centre (Comit\u00e9 d'\u00c9tude et d'Exploitation des Calculateurs \u00c9lectroniques) in Brussels which operated this computer for the government.  Initially, only the 17-rack prototype was operational.  One of the first tasks to which it was put was the calculation of Bessel functions.  The full 34-rack machine was moved from Antwerp and put into service in 1957.  Belevitch used this machine to investigate transcendental functions.[10]/nIn 1963 Belevitch became head of the newly formed Laboratoire de Recherche MBLE[note 2] (later Philips Research Laboratories Belgium) under the Philips director of research Hendrik Casimir in Eindhoven.  This facility specialised in applied mathematics for Philips and was heavily involved in computing research.  Belevitch stayed in this post until his retirement in November 1984.[11]/nBelevitch died on 26 December 1999.  He is survived by a daughter, but not his wife.[12]/nBelevitch is best known for his contributions to circuit theory, particularly the mathematical basis of filters, modulators, coupled lines, and non-linear circuits.  He was on the editorial board of the International Journal of Circuit Theory from its foundation in 1973. He also made major contributions in information theory, electronic computers, mathematics and linguistics.[13]/nBelevitch dominated international conferences and was prone to asking searching questions of the presenters of papers, often causing them some discomfort.  The organiser of one conference at Birmingham University in 1959 made Belevitch the chairman of the session in which the organiser gave his own presentation.  It seems he did this to restrain Belevitch from asking questions.  Belevitch stopped attending conferences in the mid-1970s with the exception of the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems in Montreal in 1984 in order to receive the IEEE Centennial Medal.[14]/nIt was in his 1945 dissertation that Belevitch first introduced the important idea of the scattering matrix[note 3] (called repartition matrix by Belevitch).  This work was reproduced in part in a later paper by Belevitch, Transmission Losses in 2n-terminal Networks.  Belgium was occupied by Nazi Germany for most of World War II and this prevented Belevitch from any communication with American colleagues.  It was only after the war that it was discovered that the same idea, under the scattering matrix name, had independently been used by American scientists developing military radars.  The American work by Montgomery, Dicke and Purcell was published in 1948.  Belevitch in his work had applied scattering matrices to lumped-element circuits and was certainly the first to do so, whereas the Americans were concerned with the distributed-element circuits used at microwave frequencies in radar.[15]/nBelevitch produced a textbook, Classical Network Theory, first published in 1968 which comprehensively covered the field of passive one-port, and multiport circuits.  In this work he made extensive use of the now-established S parameters from the scattering matrix concept, thus succeeding in welding the field into a coherent whole.  The eponymous Belevitch's theorem, explained in this book, provides a method of determining whether or not it is possible to construct a passive, lossless circuit from discrete elements (that is, a circuit consisting only of inductors and capacitors) that represents a given scattering matrix.[16]/nBelevitch introduced the mathematical concept of conference matrices in 1950, so called because they originally arose in connection with a problem Belevitch was working on concerning telephone conferencing.  However, they have applications in a range of other fields as well as being of interest to pure mathematics.  Belevitch was studying setting up telephone conferencing by connecting together ideal transformers.  It turns out that a necessary condition for setting up a conference with n telephone ports and ideal signal loss is the existence of an n\u00d7n conference matrix.  Ideal signal loss means the loss is only that due to splitting the signal between conference subscribers \u2013 there is no dissipation within the conference network.[17]/nThe existence of conference matrices is not a trivial question; they do not exist for all values of n.  Values of n for which they exist are always of the form 4k+2 (k integer) but this is not, by itself, a sufficient condition.  Conference matrices exist for n of 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 26, 30, 38 and 42.  They do not exist for n of 22 or 34.  Belevitch obtained complete solutions for all n up to 38 and also noted that n=66 had multiple solutions.[18]/nBelevitch wrote a comprehensive summary of the history of circuit theory.  He also had an interest in transmission lines, and published several papers on the subject.  They include papers on skin effects and coupling between lines (\"crosstalk\") due to asymmetry.[19]/nBelevitch first introduced the great factorization theorem in which he gives a factorization of paraunitary matrices.  Paraunitary matrices occur in the construction of filter banks used in multirate digital systems.  Apparently, Belevitch's work is obscure and difficult to understand.  A much more frequently cited version of this theorem was later published by P. P. Vaidyanathan.[20]/nBelevitch was educated in French but continued to speak Russian to his mother until she died.  In fact, he was able to speak many languages, and could read even more.  He studied Sanskrit and the etymology of Indo-European languages.[21]/nBelevitch wrote a book on human and machine languages in which he explored the idea of applying the mathematics of information theory to obtain results regarding human languages.  The book highlighted the difficulties for machine understanding of language for which there was some naive enthusiasm amongst cybernetics researchers in the 1950s.[22]/nBelevitch also wrote a paper, On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution,[23] which gives a derivation for the well-known empirical relationship, Zipf's law.  This law, and the more complex Mandelbrot law, provide a relationship between the frequency of word occurrence in languages and the word's rank.  In the simplest form of Zipf's law, frequency is inversely proportional to rank.  Belevitch expressed a large class of statistical distributions (not only the normal distribution) in terms of rank and then expanded each expression into a Taylor series.  In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law.  Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in Mandelbrot's law.  This gives some insight into the reason why Zipf's law has been found experimentally to hold in such a wide variety of languages.[24]/nBelevitch played a part in developing a mathematical test for determining the controllability of linear control systems.  A system is controllable if it can be moved from one state to another through the system state space in a finite time by application of control inputs.  This test is known as the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus, or PBH, test.  There is also a PBH test for determining the observability of a system \u2013 that is, the ability to determine the state of a system in finite time solely from the system's own outputs.[25]/nThe PBH test was originally discovered by Elmer G. Gilbert in 1963, but Gilbert's version only applied to systems that could be represented by a diagonalizable matrix.  The test was subsequently generalised by Vasile M. Popov (in 1966), Belevitch (in Classical Network Theory, 1968) and Malo Hautus in 1969.[26]/nBelevitch was a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and was vice-chair of the Benelux section when it was formed in 1959.[27]  He was awarded the IEEE Centennial Medal, and in 1993, the Society Award (now called Mac Van Valkenburg Award) of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.[28]  He was also a member of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences.[29]/nBelevitch received an honorary doctoral degree in 1975 from the Technical University of Munich, and another from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1978.  He was also rewarded with Belgian royal medals.[30]/nSince 2003, the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society has instituted a Vitold Belevitch award for work in circuit theory.  The award is presented biennially at the European Conference on Circuit Theory & Design.[31]/nBelevitch was a prolific publisher with around 4000 pages of scientific output.  He was publishing throughout his career right up to, and beyond, his retirement in 1984.[32]", "61391712": "Kaumudi Jinraj Joshipura is an Indian American Epidemiologist, Biostatistician, Dentist & Scientist.

Alexander Crum Brown Road in Edinburgh's King's Buildings complex is named after him./nCrum Brown was born at 4 Bellevue Terrace[1] in Edinburgh. His mother, Margaret Fisher Crum (d.1841), was the sister of the chemist Walter Crum, and his father, Rev Dr John Brown (1784-1858), was minister of Broughton Place Church[2] in the east end of Edinburgh's New Town.[3][4] His half brother was the physician and essayist John Brown./nFor five years he studied at the Royal High School, then for one year at Mill Hill School in London. In 1854, he entered the University of Edinburgh where he first studied Arts and then Medicine. He was gold medallist in Chemistry and Natural Philosophy and graduated with an MA in 1858. Continuing his medical studies, he received his MD in 1861.[5] At this time he was also studying for a science degree at the University of London, and in 1862 became the first Doctor of Science at the University of London. After his graduation as from the University of Edinburgh he continued studying chemistry in Germany, first under Robert Bunsen at the University of Heidelberg, and then at the University of Marburg under Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe.[6]/nIn 1863, he returned to the University of Edinburgh as an extra-academical lecturer in chemistry. In 1869, he was appointed the Professor of Chemistry[7] holding the chair until his retirement in 1908. In his application for this position he was supported by famous chemists such as Baeyer, Beilstein, Bunsen, Butlerov, Erlenmeyer, Hofmann, Kolbe, Volhard and W\u00f6hler.[7] One of his students was Arthur Conan Doyle.[8] The Crum Brown Chair of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh was established in 1967 in his honour.[9]/nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1863, was awarded its Keith Medal for 1873\u201375. He served as the Society's vice president from 1905 to 1911.[2] His address at the time of joining the Society was given as 8 Belgrave Crescent in the west end of Edinburgh.[10] In 1867 he was elected a member of the Harveian Society of Edinburgh and served as one of its secretaries from 1881-1903. He was president of the Society in 1899.[11]  In 1883 he was elected a member of the Aesculapian Club.[12]/nEach year, the Hope Scholarship was awarded to the four students at the University of Edinburgh who achieved the highest marks (at first sitting) in the first-term examinations in Chemistry. The Hope Scholars were entitled to free use of the laboratory facilities during the following term. In 1870, Edith Pechey, one of the Edinburgh Seven, came third in the class, beaten by two male students sitting the exam for the second time, so under the terms of the Hope Scholarship, she had first claim on a scholarship. Fearing that awarding the prize to a woman would be both an affront to many of his esteemed colleagues in the Medical Faculty and a provocation to the male students, Crum Brown chose to award the Hope Scholarship to men whose names appeared lower on the list./nThis had important consequences. It made national headlines in The Times and drew attention to the difficulties being encountered by a small group of women studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh./n\"[Miss Pechey] has done her sex a service, not only by vindicating their intellectual ability in an open competition with men, but still more by the temper and courtesy with which she meets her disappointment\" [13]/nCrum Brown's pioneering work concerned the development of a system of representing chemical compounds in diagrammatic form. In 1864 he began to draw pictures of molecules, in which he enclosed the symbols for atoms in circles, and used dashed lines to connect the atomic symbols together in a way that satisfied each atom's valence. The results of his influential work were published in 1864[6][14] and reprinted in 1865.[15]/nAlthough Crum Brown apparently never contemplated the practice of medicine, his training as a medical student gave him an interest in physiology and pharmacology. This led him to collaborate during 1867\u20138 with T. R. Fraser, a distinguished medical graduate, in a pioneering investigation of fundamental importance into the connection between chemical constitution and physiological action. Their method \"consists in performing upon a substance a chemical operation which shall introduce a known change into its constitution, and then examining and comparing the physiological action of the substance before and after the change.\" The change considered was the addition of ethyl iodide to various alkaloids and comparison of the iodides (and the corresponding sulfates) thus obtained with the hydrochlorides of the original alkaloids. Striking regularities were observed, amongst others \"that when a nitrile [tertiary] base possesses a strychnialike action, the salts of the corresponding ammonium [quaternary] bases have an action identical with curare [poison].\"[6]/nHe discovered the carbon double bond of ethylene, which was to have important implications for the modern plastics industry. He also made significant contributions to pharmacology, and worked with physiology, phonetics, mathematics and crystallography.[6]/nDuring the 1880s, Crum Brown studied combinations of colours, inks, and designs which helped the Bank of Scotland manufacture bank notes that would be impossible to fabricate using photography. The forgery-proof bank notes were completed in 1885. In November 1888 however, forgeries of these bank notes were discovered in Glasgow and Edinburgh, in which the culprit was found in 1889 to be John Hamilton Gray Mitchell, who had made the fake noted using traditional artistic mediums. The Bank of Scotland amended the bank notes' design.[16]/nIn 1912, he introduced the name of kerogen to cover the insoluble organic matter in oil shale.[17]/nAlthough physically not particularly robust, he was rarely ill. He spent much of his holiday time walking in the Scottish Highlands and in Europe./nIn 1866, he married Jane Bailie Porter (d.1910). Porter was the sister of  William Archer Porter, James Porter and Margaret Archer Porter, who married physicist Peter Tait./nHe remained intellectually active until his death in Edinburgh in 1922.[6]/nCrum Brown died 28 October 1922, and is buried on the obscured southern terrace of Dean Cemetery./nWilliam Brassey Hole's sketch of Crum Brown in a laboratory in 1884, is held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.[18]/nIn 2015 the City of Edinburgh Council agreed a request by the University of Edinburgh to name a street within the King's Buildings complex after Crum Brown./nThis article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain: J.W.

His name is usually associated with the law of refraction of light known as Snell's law.[5]/nThe lunar crater Snellius is named after Willebrord Snellius. The Royal Netherlands Navy has named three survey ships after Snellius, including a currently-serving vessel./nWillebrord Snellius was born in Leiden, Netherlands. In 1613 he succeeded his father, Rudolph Snel van Royen (1546\u20131613) as professor of mathematics at the University of Leiden.[6]/nIn 1615, Snellius, after the work of Eratosthenes in Ptolemaic Egypt in the 3rd century BC, probably was the first to try to do a large-scale experiment to measure the circumference of the earth using triangulation.[7][8] He was helped in his measurements by two of his students, the Austrian barons Erasmus and Casparus Sterrenberg. In several cities he also received support of friends among the city leaders (regenten). In his work The terrae Ambitus vera quantitate (1617) under the author's name (\"The Dutch Eratosthenes\") Snellius describes the methods he used. He came up with an estimate of 28,500 Rhineland rods \u2013 in modern units 107.37 km[9] for one degree of latitude. 360 times 107.37 then gives a circumference of the Earth of 38,653\u00a0km. The actual circumference is 40,075 kilometers, so Snellius underestimated the circumference of the earth by 3.5%./nSnellius came to his result by calculating the distances between a number of high points in the plain west and southwest of the Netherlands using triangulation. In order to carry out these measurements accurately Snellius had a large quadrant built, with which he could accurately measure angles in tenths of degrees. This quadrant can still be seen in the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. In a network of fourteen cities a total of 53 triangulation measurements were made. In his calculations Snellius made use of a solution for what is now called the Snellius\u2013Pothenot problem./nBy necessity Snellius's high points were nearly all church spires. There were hardly any other tall buildings at that time in the west of the Netherlands. More or less ordered from north to south and/or in successive order of measuring, Snellius used a network of fourteen measure points: Alkmaar\u00a0: St. Laurenskerk; Haarlem\u00a0: Sint-Bavokerk; Leiden\u00a0: a then new part (built in 1599) of the City walls;[10] The Hague\u00a0: Sint-Jacobskerk; Amsterdam\u00a0: Oude Kerk; Utrecht\u00a0: Cathedral of Utrecht; Zaltbommel\u00a0: Sint-Maartenskerk; Gouda\u00a0: Sint Janskerk; Oudewater\u00a0: Sint-Michaelskerk; Rotterdam\u00a0: Sint-Laurenskerk; Dordrecht\u00a0: Grote Kerk; Willemstad\u00a0: Koepelkerk; Bergen-op-Zoom\u00a0: Gertrudiskerk; Breda\u00a0: Grote Kerk/nThe actual distance between the two church spires in Alkmaar and Breda, two places nearly on the same meridian,[11] is 116.1 kilometers.[12] The difference in latitude between Alkmaar (52\u00b0 37' 57\" N) and Breda (51\u00b0 35' 20\" N) is 1.0436 degree. Assuming Snellius corrected for this he must have calculated a distance of 107.37 * 1.0436 = 112.05 kilometers between the Sint-Laurenskerk in Alkmaar and the Grote Kerk in Breda./nSnellius was also a distinguished mathematician, producing a new method for calculating \u03c0\u2014the first such improvement since ancient times. He rediscovered the law of refraction in 1621.[13]/nIn addition to the Eratosthenes Batavus, he published Cyclometricus, de circuli dimensione (1621), and Tiphys Batavus (1624). He also edited Coeli et siderum in eo errantium observationes Hassiacae (1618), containing the astronomical observations of Landgrave William IV of Hesse. A work on trigonometry (Doctrina triangulorum) authored by Snellius was published a year after his death.[6]/nSnellius died in Leiden in October 1626, at the age of 46 from an illness diagnosed as colic.[14] His grave can be seen in the Pieterskerk, Leiden./nSnellius Glacier in Antarctica is named after Willebrord Snellius.", "32523108": "Morris William Hirsch (born June 28, 1933) is an American mathematician, formerly at the University of California, Berkeley./nA native of Chicago, Illinois, Hirsch attained his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1958, under supervision of Edwin Spanier and Stephen Smale.[1] His thesis was entitled Immersions of Manifolds.

Wenninger OSB (October 31, 1919[1]\u2013 February 17, 2017) was an American mathematician who worked on constructing polyhedron models, and wrote the first book on their construction.[1]/nBorn to German immigrants in Park Falls, Wisconsin, Joseph Wenninger always knew he was going to be a priest.  From an early age, it was understood that his brother Heinie would take after their father and become a baker, and that Joe, as he was then known, would go into the priesthood.[1]/nWhen Wenninger was thirteen, after graduating from the parochial school in Park Falls, Wisconsin, his parents saw an advertisement in the German newspaper Der Wanderer that would help to shape the rest of his life.  The ad was for a preparatory school in Collegeville, Minnesota, associated with the Benedictine St. John's University.[1]/nWhile admitting to feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that this was where he needed to be.  He was a student in a section of the prep school that functioned as a \"minor seminary\" \u2013 later moving on into St. John's where he studied philosophy and theology, which led into the priesthood.[1]/nWhen Fr. Wenninger became a Benedictine monk, he took on his monastic name Magnus, meaning \"Great\".  At the start of his career, Wenninger did not set out on a path one might expect would lead to his becoming the great polyhedronist that he is known as today. Rather, a few chance happenings and seemingly minor decisions shaped a course for Wenninger that led to his groundbreaking studies.[1]/nShortly after becoming a priest, Wenninger's Abbot informed him that their order was starting up a school in the Bahamas.  It was decided that Wenninger would be assigned to teach at that school.  In order to do this, it was necessary that he get a master's degree. Wenninger was sent to the University of Ottawa, in Canada, to study educational psychology. There he studied symbolic logic under Thomas Greenwood of the philosophy department. His thesis title was \"The Concept of Number According to Roger Bacon and Albert the Great\".[1]/nAfter completing his degree, Wenninger went to the school in the Bahamas, where he was asked by the headmaster to choose between teaching English or math. Wenninger chose math, since it seemed to be more in line with the topic of his MA thesis. However, not having taken many math courses in college, Wenninger admits to being able to teach by staying a few pages ahead of the students. He taught Algebra, Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.[1]/nAfter ten years of teaching, Wenninger felt he was becoming a bit stale.  At the suggestion of his headmaster, Wenninger attended the Columbia Teachers College in summer sessions over a four-year period in the late fifties. It was here that his interest in the \"New Math\" was formed and his studies of the polyhedra began.[1]/nWenninger died at the age of 97, at St John's Abbey on Friday, February 17, 2017.[2][3]/nWenninger's first publication on the topic of polyhedra was the booklet entitled, \"Polyhedron Models for the Classroom\", which he wrote in 1966. He wrote to H. S. M. Coxeter and received a copy of Uniform polyhedra which had a complete list of all 75 uniform polyhedra. After this, he spent a great deal of time building various polyhedra. He made 65 of them and had them on display in his classroom. At this point, Wenninger decided to contact a publisher to see if there was any interest in a book. He had the models photographed and wrote the accompanying text, which he sent off to Cambridge University Press in London. The publishers indicated an interest in the book only if Wenninger built all 75 of the uniform polyhedra.[1]/nWenninger did complete the models, with the help of R. Buckley of Oxford University who had done the calculations for the snub forms by computer. This allowed Wenninger to build these difficult polyhedra with the exact measurements for lengths of the edges and shapes of the faces. This was the first time that all of the uniform polyhedra had been made as paper models. This project took Wenninger nearly ten years, and the book, Polyhedron Models, was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1971, largely due to the exceptional photographs taken locally in Nassau.[1]/nFrom 1971 onward, Wenninger focused his attention on the projection of the uniform polyhedra onto the surface of their circumscribing spheres. This led to the publication of his second book, Spherical Models in 1979, showing how regular and semiregular polyhedra can be used to build geodesic domes. He also exchanged ideas with other mathematicians, Hugo Verheyen and Gilbert Fleurent.[1]/nIn 1981, Wenninger left the Bahamas and returned to St. John's Abbey. His third book, Dual Models, appeared in 1983.

Engraved under his bust is the inscription \"Johannes Blagravius, totus mathematicus, cum matre sepultus\".[8][9]:309/nIn his will, Blagrave left his lease on lands at Southcot to his nephew, the regicide Daniel Blagrave. He left money to more than eighty of his relatives.

Describing, in detail, an advanced universal astrolabe of Blagrave's design - incorporating the designs of earlier astrolabists. The 'jewel' consisted of four movable parts - Mater, Rete, Label, and Rule - which were lavishly illustrated in the book's frontispiece and engraved plates. The 'jewel's' uses were described in the third book as being used for anything from trigonometry, to navigation, to astrology; in Blagrave's words from the 'jewel' one could draw \"so infinite a number of conclusions, more than I thinke I shall ever have time to write\".[7][13][14][15] The astrolabe contains some significant similarities to the universal astrolabe of Andalusian astrolabist Ali ibn Khalaf and David A. King has suggested that Blagrave copied his design for the 'Jewel' from ibn Khalaf.[16]/nAnother of Blagrave's works, The art of dyalling, is notable as it contains one of the earliest descriptions of the construction of a sundial.[17]/nAside from his mathematical work, Blagrave was also a prominent student of astrology - as evidenced in his book's advertisements of the astrological capabilities of his astronomical instruments. Genealogist Lady Russell reports that Blagrave influenced the prominent hermeticist William Backhouse (who he taught mathematics) towards the study of astrology in a manuscript he wrote to him[9]:124 but future scholars, such as J.

Specifically, he was found guilty of murder, bodily harm and two cases of kidnapping.[31][32][33][34][35] The verdict marked the first time that an elected head of state has been extradited to his home country, tried, and convicted of human rights violations./nIn July 2009, Fujimori was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment for embezzlement after he admitted to giving $15\u00a0million from the Peruvian treasury to Montesinos.[36] Two months later, he pleaded guilty in a fourth trial to bribery and received an additional six-year term.[37] Transparency International determined the money embezzled by the Fujimori government \u2013 about $600\u00a0million or about $861 million in 2021 \u2013 to be the seventh-most for a head of government active within 1984\u20132004.[38][39] Under Peruvian law, all the resultant sentences must run concurrently; thus, the maximum length of imprisonment remained 25 years.[40]/nIn December 2017, Fujimori was pardoned by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, shortly after Fujimori's son, Congressman Kenji Fujimori, helped President Kuczynski survive an impeachment vote.[41][42] The pardon was overturned by Peru's Supreme Court on 3 October 2018, and Fujimori was sent back to prison in January 2019.[43][44][45] The Constitutional Court of Peru in a 4\u20133 ruling on 17 March 2022 reinstated the pardon.[46] On 8 April 2022, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights overruled the Constitutional Court and ordered Peru not to release Fujimori.[47] The Constitutional Court ordered on 5 December 2023 that he be immediately released.[48]/nHis daughter Keiko Fujimori, who is active in Peruvian politics and has run for President several times, has said that she would pardon her father should she be elected./nAccording to government records, Fujimori was born on 28 July 1938, in Miraflores, a district of Lima.[49] His parents, Naoichi Fujimori (original surname Minami, adopted by a childless relative; 1897\u20131971) and Mutsue Inomoto (1913\u20132009), were natives of Kumamoto, Japan, who migrated to Peru in 1934.[50][51]/nIn July 1997, the news magazine Caretas alleged that Fujimori was born in Japan, in his father's hometown of Kawachi, Kumamoto Prefecture.[52] Because Peru's constitution requires the president to have been born in Peru, this would have made Fujimori ineligible to be president.[50] The magazine, which had been sued for libel by Vladimiro Montesinos seven years earlier,[53] reported that Fujimori's birth and baptismal certificates might have been altered.[52] Caretas also alleged that Fujimori's mother declared having two children when she entered Peru;[52] Fujimori is the second of four children.[54] Caretas' contentions were hotly contested in the Peruvian media; the magazine S\u00ed described the allegations as \"pathetic\" and \"a dark page for [Peruvian] journalism\".[55] Latin American scholars Cynthia McClintock and Fabi\u00e1n Vallas note that the issue appeared to have died down among Peruvians after the Japanese government announced in 2000 that \"Fujimori's parents had registered his birth in the Japanese consulate in Lima\".[50] The Japanese government determined that he was also a Japanese citizen because of his parents' registration in the koseki.[56]/nFujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Merced[57] and La Rectora School.[58] Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptized and raised Roman Catholic. Aside from Spanish, he also spoke Japanese, due to it being the primary language in his childhood home.[59] In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La Gran Unidad Escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima.[60]/nHe went on to undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an agricultural engineer. The following year he lectured on mathematics at the university. In 1964 he went to study physics at the University of Strasbourg in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee[61] in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969./nIn 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, and a son, Kenji, who would later follow their father into politics./nIn recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the National Agrarian University offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called \"Concertando\" from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, Channel 7.[62]/nDuring the presidency of Alan Garc\u00eda, the economy had entered a period of hyperinflation and the political system was in crisis due to the country's internal conflict, leaving Peru in \"economic and political chaos\".[63]  The Peruvian armed forces grew frustrated with the inability of the Garc\u00eda administration to handle the nation's crises and began to draft Plan Verde as a plan to overthrow his government.[13][14] According to Rospigliosi, lawyer and friend of Fujimori, Vladimiro Montesinos, was not initially involved with Plan Verde, but his ability to resolve issues for the military resulted with the armed forces tasking Montesinos with implementing the plan with Fujimori,[11] while Schulte-Bockholt would say that both General Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza and Montesinos were responsible for the relationship between the armed forces and Fujimori.[14] Mario Vargas Llosa later reported that United States Ambassador to Peru, Anthony C. E. Quainton, personally told him that allegedly leaked documents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) purportedly being supportive of Fujimori's candidacy were authentic.[64] Rend\u00f3n writes that the United States supported Fujimori because of his relationship with Montesinos, who had previously been charged with spying on the Peruvian military for the CIA.[14][64]/nDuring the second round of elections, Fujimori originally received support from left-wing groups and those close to the Garc\u00eda government, exploiting the popular distrust of the existing Peruvian political establishment and the uncertainty about the proposed neoliberal economic reforms of his opponent, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.[65] Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a dark horse candidate under the banner of Cambio 90 (\"cambio\" means \"change\") defeating Vargas Llosa in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president Alan Garc\u00eda and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party (APRA)./nDuring the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed El Chino, which translates to \"the Chinese guy\" or \"the Chinaman\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called chino in Peru, as elsewhere in Spanish Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always pleased by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.[66] With his election victory, he became just the second person of East Asian descent to become leader of a Latin American nation, after Fulgencio Batista (varied descent) of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henk Chin A Sen of Suriname.[67]/nAccording to Oiga, the armed forces finalized plans on 18 June 1990 involving multiple scenarios for a coup to be executed on 27 July 1990, the day prior to Fujimori's inauguration.[68] The magazine noted that in one of the scenarios, titled \"Negotiation and agreement with Fujimori. Bases of negotiation: concept of directed Democracy and Market Economy\", Fujimori was to be directed on accepting the military's plan at least twenty-four hours before his inauguration.[68] Rospigliosi states \"an understanding was established between Fujimori, Montesinos and some of the military officers\" involved in Plan Verde prior to Fujimori's inauguration.[15] Montesinos and SIN officials would ultimately assume the armed force's position in the plan, placing SIN operatives into military leadership roles.[11] Fujimori would go on to adopt many of the policies outlined in Plan Verde.[14][15]/nAfter taking office, Fujimori abandoned the economic platform he promoted during his campaign, adopting more aggressive neoliberal policies than those espoused by his competitor in the election.[69] During his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as \"Fujishock\". It was Fujimori's stated objective to pacify the nation and restore economic balance. This program bore little resemblance to his campaign platform and was in fact more drastic than anything Vargas Llosa had proposed.[70] Hernando de Soto, the founder of one of the first neoliberal organizations in Latin America, Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD), began to receive assistance from Ronald Reagan's administration, with the National Endowment for Democracy's Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE) providing his ILD with funding and education for advertising campaigns.[71][72][73] Between 1988 and 1995, de Soto and the ILD were mainly responsible for some four hundred initiatives, laws, and regulations that led to significant changes in Peru's economic system.[74][75] Under Fujimori, de Soto served as \"the President's personal representative\", with The New York Times describing de Soto as an \"overseas salesman\" for Fujimori in 1990, writing that he had represented the government when meeting with creditors and United States representatives.[74] Others dubbed de Soto as the \"informal president\" for Fujimori.[71] De Soto proved to be influential to Fujimori, who began to repeat de Soto's advocacy for deregulating the Peruvian economy.[76] The IMF was content with Peru's measures, and guaranteed loan funding for Peru.[77] Inflation rapidly began to fall and foreign investment capital flooded in.[77] \nNonetheless, the Fujishock succeeded in restoring Peru to the global economy, though not without immediate social cost; international business participated in crony capitalism with the government.[78][79] The privatization campaign involved selling off of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, and replacing the country's troubled currency, the inti, with the Nuevo Sol.[63]  Fujimori's initiative relaxed private sector price controls, drastically reduced government subsidies and government employment, eliminated all exchange controls, and also reduced restrictions on investment, imports, and capital.[78] Tariffs were radically simplified, the minimum wage was immediately quadrupled, and the government established a $400 million poverty relief fund.[78] The latter seemed to anticipate the economic agony to come: the price of electricity quintupled, water prices rose eightfold, and gasoline prices 3,000%.[70][78]/nDuring Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, the FREDEMO, remained in control of both chambers of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, hampering the enactment of economic reform. Fujimori also had difficulty combatting the Maoist Shining Path (Spanish: Sendero Luminoso) guerrilla organization due largely to what he perceived as intransigence and obstructionism in Congress. By March 1992, the Congress met with the approval of only 17% of the electorate, according to one poll; in the same poll, the president's approval stood at 42%.[80]/nFujimori and his military handlers had planned for a coup during his preceding two years in office.[81][14][68] In response to the political deadlock, Fujimori, with the support of the military, on 5 April 1992, carried out a self-coup,[82] also known as the autogolpe (auto-coup) or Fujigolpe (Fuji-coup) in Peru. Congress was shut down by the military, the constitution was suspended and the judiciary was dissolved.[83] Without political obstacles, the military was able to implement the objectives outlined in Plan Verde[14][81][68] while Fujimori served as a figurehead leader to project an image that Peru was supporting a liberal democracy.[5][10] Montesinos would go on to adopt the actual function of Peru's government.[10]/nAccording to numerous polls, the coup was welcomed by the public[84] as evidenced by favorable public opinion in several independent polls; in fact, public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly in the wake of the coup.[84][85] Fujimori often cited this public support in defending the coup, which he characterized as \"not a negation of real democracy, but on the contrary... a search for an authentic transformation to assure a legitimate and effective democracy.\"[84] Fujimori believed that Peruvian democracy had been nothing more than \"a deceptive formality \u2013 a fa\u00e7ade\".[84] He claimed the coup was necessary to break with the deeply entrenched special interests that were hindering him from rescuing Peru from the chaotic state in which Garc\u00eda had left it.[86]/nFujimori's coup was immediately met with near-unanimous condemnation from the international community.[84] The Organization of American States denounced the coup and demanded a return to \"representative democracy\",[87] despite Fujimori's claim that the coup represented a \"popular uprising\".[84] Foreign ministers of OAS member states reiterated this condemnation of the autogolpe.[85] They proposed an urgent effort to promote the reestablishment of \"the democratic institutional order\" in Peru.[88] Negotiations between the OAS, the government, and opposition groups initially led Alberto Fujimori to propose a referendum to ratify the auto-coup, but the OAS rejected this. Fujimori then proposed scheduling elections for a Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), which would draft a new constitution to be ratified by a national referendum. Despite a lack of consensus among political forces in Peru regarding this proposal, an ad hoc OAS meeting of ministers nevertheless endorsed this scenario in mid-May. Elections for the Democratic Constituent Congress were held on 22 November 1992.[85]/nVarious states individually condemned the coup. Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations, and Argentina withdrew its ambassador. Chile joined Argentina in requesting Peru's suspension from the Organization of American States. International lenders delayed planned or projected loans, and the United States, Germany and Spain suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Peru. The coup appeared to threaten the reinsertion strategy for economic recovery, and complicated the process of clearing Peru's arrears with the International Monetary Fund./nFujimori, in turn, would later receive most of the participants of the Venezuelan coup attempt of November 1992 as political asylees, who had fled to Peru after its failure.[89]/nPeruvian\u2013U.S. relations earlier in Fujimori's presidency had been dominated by questions of coca eradication and Fujimori's initial reluctance to sign an accord to increase his military's eradication efforts in the lowlands. Fujimori's autogolpe became a major obstacle to relations, as the United States immediately suspended all military and economic aid, with exceptions for counter-narcotic and humanitarian funds.[90] Two weeks after the self-coup, however, the George H. W. Bush administration changed its position and officially recognized Fujimori as the legitimate leader of Peru, partly because he was willing to implement economic austerity measures, but also because of his adamant opposition to the Shining Path.[91]/nWith FREDEMO dissolved and APRA leader Alan Garc\u00eda exiled to Colombia, Fujimori sought to legitimize his position. He called elections for a Democratic Constitutional Congress, to serve as a legislature and as a constituent assembly. The APRA and Popular Action attempted a boycott of this election, but the Christian People's Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP, Partido Comunista del Peru, or \"Peruvian Communist Party\") and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. Fujimori supporters won a majority of the seats in this body and drafted a new constitution in 1993. In a referendum, the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a margin of less than five percent.[92]/nOn 13 November 1993, General Jaime Salinas led a failed military coup. Salinas asserted that his intentions were to turn Fujimori over to be tried for violating the Peruvian constitution.[93]/nIn 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife Susana Higuchi in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title First Lady in August 1994, appointing their eldest daughter as First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a \"tyrant\" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.[94]/nIn Fujimori's first term of office, over 3,000 Peruvians were killed in political murders.[95][needs context]/nThe 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former UN Secretary-General Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, won only 21 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majority in the newly unicameral Congress. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the Peruvian military or police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.[96]/nDuring his second term, Fujimori along with Ecuadorian President Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n, signed a peace agreement with Ecuador over a border dispute that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, which had been unresolved since the 1929 Treaty of Lima.[97]/nThe 1995 election was the turning point in Fujimori's career. Peruvians began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press. However, before he was sworn in for a second term, Fujimori stripped two universities of their autonomy and reshuffled the national electoral board. This led his opponents to call him \"Chinochet,\" a reference to his previous nickname and to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.[98] Modeling his rule after Pinochet, Fujimori reportedly enjoyed this nickname.[99]/nAccording to a poll by the Peruvian Research and Marketing Company conducted in 1997, 40.6% of Lima residents considered President Fujimori an authoritarian.[100][101][102]/nIn addition to the fate of democracy under Fujimori, Peruvians were becoming increasingly interested in the myriad allegations of criminality that involved Fujimori and his chief of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), Vladimiro Montesinos. Using SIN, Fujimori gained control of the majority of the armed forces, with Financial Times stating that \"[i]n no other country in Latin America did a president have so much control over the armed forces\".[95]/nA 2002 report by Health Minister Fernando Carbone later suggested that Fujimori was involved in the forced sterilizations of up to 300,000 indigenous women between 1996 and 2000, as part of a population control program.[24] A 2004 World Bank publication said that in this period Montesinos' abuse of the power Fujimori granted him \"led to a steady and systematic undermining of the rule of law\".[103]/nThe 1993 constitution limited a presidency to two terms. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of \"authentic interpretation\" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000. A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.[104] In late 1999, Fujimori announced that he would run for a third term. Peruvian electoral bodies, which were politically sympathetic to Fujimori, accepted his argument that the two-term restriction did not apply to him, as it was enacted while he was already in office.[105]/nExit polls showed Fujimori fell short of the 50% required to avoid an electoral runoff, but the first official results showed him with 49.6% of the vote, just short of outright victory. Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%\u201420,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, Alejandro Toledo, called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing \"No to fraud!\" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff./nIn the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the total votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 37.0% of the total votes cast in the first round to 17.7% of the votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 8.1% of the total votes cast in the first round to 31.1% of total votes in the second round.[106] The large percentage of invalid votes in this election suggests that many Peruvians took Toledo's advice and spoiled their ballots./nAlthough Fujimori won the runoff with only a bare majority (but 3/4 valid votes), rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace. As a conciliatory gesture, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate Federico Salas as prime minister. However, opposition parties in Congress refused to support this move, and Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving Vladimiro Montesinos broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station Canal N broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for defecting to Fujimori's Peru 2000 party. The video was presented by Fernando Olivera, leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies[who?] (nicknamed by the Peruvian press El Patriota)./nFujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections, in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to Brunei to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On 16 November, Valent\u00edn Paniagua took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential resignation via fax. Congress refused to accept his resignation, instead voting 62\u20139 to remove Fujimori from office on the grounds that he was \"permanently morally disabled.\"/nOn 19 November, government ministers presented their resignations en bloc. Fujimori's first vice president, Francisco Tudela, had broken with Fujimori and resigned a few days earlier. This left second vice president Ricardo M\u00e1rquez Flores as next in line for the presidency. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; M\u00e1rquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April 2001 elections./nAlberto Fujimori was accused of a series of embezzlement of public funds, abuse of power and corruption during almost 10 years as president (1990\u20132000), especially when he gained greater control after the self-coup. The network operated as a kleptocracy in three spheres: business, politics and the military.[107]/nWith multimillion-dollar annual expenditures in 1992 (five billion dollars in public spending plus another five billion in state enterprises),9 part of the funds were diverted to political and military institutions. According to the National Anti-Corruption Initiative (INA) in 2001, they corresponded to 30\u201335% of the average budget expenditure in each year, and 4% of the average annual GDP during the same period.[108]/nOne of those responsible for maintaining an image of apparent honesty and government approval was Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), who systematically bribed politicians, judges and the media. That criminal network also involved authorities of his government; furthermore, due to privatisation and the arrival of foreign capital, companies close to the Ministry of Economy were allowed to use state money for public works tenders, as in the cases of AeroPer\u00fa, JJC Contratistas Generales (of the Camet Dickmann family) and the Banco de Cr\u00e9dito.[109]/nAlthough in 1999 the opposition made a public denunciation that ended in the resignation of five ministers, this network was later revealed in 2000, just before the president resigned, when the Swiss embassy in Peru informed the then Minister of Justice Alberto Bustamante and the attorney general Jos\u00e9 Ugaz of more than 40 million dollars coming from Montesinos, in which he was denounced for \"illicit enrichment to the detriment of the Peruvian state\". Ugaz was in charge of the investigation until 2002.[109]/nAccording to Transparency International in 2004, Fujimori was listed as the seventh most corrupt former leader in history.[110]/nWhen Fujimori came to power, much of Peru was dominated by the Maoist insurgent group Sendero Luminoso (\"Shining Path\"), and the Marxist\u2013Leninist group T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). In 1989, 25% of Peru's district and provincial councils opted not to hold elections, owing to a persistent campaign of assassination, over the course of which over 100 officials had been killed by the Shining Path in that year alone. That same year, more than one-third of Peru's courts lacked a justice of the peace due to Shining Path intimidation. Labor union leaders and military officials were also assassinated throughout the 1980s.[111]/nBy the early 1990s, some parts of the country were under the control of the insurgents, in territories known as \"zonas liberadas\" (\"liberated zones\"), where inhabitants lived under the rule of these groups and paid them taxes.[112] When the Shining Path arrived in Lima, it organized \"paros armados\" (\"armed strikes\"), which were enforced by killings and other forms of violence. The leadership of the Shining Path largely consisted of university students and teachers.[113] Two previous governments, those of Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry and Alan Garc\u00eda, at first neglected the threat posed by the Shining Path, then launched an unsuccessful military campaign to eradicate it, undermining public faith in the state and precipitating an exodus of elites.[114]/nBy 1992, Shining Path guerrilla attacks had claimed an estimated 20,000 lives over preceding 12 years.[citation needed] On 16 July 1992, the Tarata bombing, in which several car bombs exploded in Lima's wealthiest district, killed over 40 people; the bombings were characterized by one commentator as an \"offensive to challenge President Alberto Fujimori.\"[115] The bombing at Tarata was followed up with a \"weeklong wave of car bombings ... Bombs hit banks, hotels, schools, restaurants, police stations and shops ... [G]uerrillas bombed two rail bridges from the Andes, cutting off some of Peru's largest copper mines from coastal ports.\"[116]/nFujimori has been credited by many Peruvians[who?] with ending the fifteen-year insurgency of the Shining Path. As part of his anti-insurgency efforts, Fujimori granted the military broad powers to arrest suspected insurgents and try them in secret military courts with few legal rights. This measure has often been criticized for compromising the fundamental democratic and human right to an open trial wherein the accused faces the accuser. Fujimori contended that these measures were both justified and also necessary. Members of the judiciary were too afraid to charge the alleged insurgents, and judges and prosecutors had very legitimate fears of reprisals against them or their families.[117] At the same time, Fujimori's government armed rural Peruvians, organizing them into groups known as \"rondas campesinas\" (\"peasant patrols\")./nInsurgent activity was in decline by the end of 1992,[118] and Fujimori took credit for this abatement, claiming that his campaign had largely eliminated the insurgent threat. After the 1992 auto-coup, the intelligence work of the DINCOTE (National Counter-Terrorism Directorate) led to the capture of the leaders from MRTA and the Shining Path, including notorious Shining Path leader Abimael Guzm\u00e1n. Guzm\u00e1n's capture was a political coup for Fujimori, who used it to great effect in the press; in an interview with documentarian Ellen Perry, Fujimori even notes that he specially ordered Guzm\u00e1n's prison jumpsuit to be white with black stripes, to enhance the image of his capture in the media.[119]/nCritics charge that to achieve the defeat of the Shining Path, the Peruvian military engaged in widespread human rights abuses, and that the majority of the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents./nThe Japanese embassy hostage crisis began on 17 December 1996, when fourteen MRTA militants seized the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima during a party, taking hostage some four hundred diplomats, government officials, and other dignitaries. The action was partly in protest of prison conditions in Peru. During the four-month standoff, the Emerretistas gradually freed all but 72 of their hostages. The government rejected the militants' demand to release imprisoned MRTA members and secretly prepared an elaborate plan to storm the residence, while stalling by negotiating with the hostage-takers.[120]/nOn 22 April 1997, a team of military commandos, codenamed \"Chav\u00edn de Huantar\", raided the building. One hostage, two military commandos, and all 14 MRTA insurgents were killed in the operation.[121] Images of President Fujimori at the ambassador's residence during and after the military operation, surrounded by soldiers and liberated dignitaries, and walking among the corpses of the insurgents, were widely televised. The conclusion of the four-month-long standoff was used by Fujimori and his supporters to bolster his image as tough on terrorism.[122]/nSeveral organizations criticized Fujimori's methods against the Shining Path and the MRTA. Amnesty International said \"the widespread and systematic nature of human rights violations committed during the government of former head of state Alberto Fujimori (1990\u20132000) in Peru constitute crimes against humanity under international law.\"[123] Fujimori's alleged association with death squads is currently[when?] being studied by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, after the court accepted the case of \"Cantuta vs Per\u00fa\".[citation needed]/nThe 1991 Barrios Altos massacre by members of the death squad Grupo Colina, made up solely of members of the Peruvian armed forces, was one of the crimes that Peru cited in its request to Japan for his extradition in 2003./nReportedly following socioeconomic objectives calling for the \"total extermination\" of \"culturally backward and economically impoverished groups\" determined by the Peruvian military in Plan Verde,[124][125][126][127] from 1996 to 2000, the Fujimori government oversaw a massive forced sterilization campaign known as the National Program for Reproductive Health and Family Planning (PNSRPF). According to Back and Zavala, the plan was an example of ethnic cleansing as it targeted indigenous and rural women.[127] The United Nations and other international aid agencies supported this campaign. USAID provided funding and training until it was exposed by objections by churches and human rights groups.[128] The Nippon Foundation, headed by Ayako Sono, a Japanese novelist and personal friend of Fujimori, supported as well.[129][130] In the four-year Plan Verde period, over 215,000 people, mostly women, entirely indigenous, were forced or threatened into sterilization and 16,547 men were forced to undergo vasectomies during these years, most of them without a proper anesthetist, in contrast to 80,385 sterilizations and 2,795 vasectomies over the previous three years.[24]/nThe success of the military operation in the Japanese embassy hostage crisis was tainted by subsequent allegations that at least three and possibly eight of the insurgents were summarily executed by the commandos after surrendering. In 2002, the case was taken up by public prosecutors, but the Peruvian Supreme Court ruled that the military tribunals had jurisdiction. A military court later absolved them of guilt, and the \"Chav\u00edn de Huantar\" soldiers led the 2004 military parade. In response, in 2003 MRTA family members lodged a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) accusing the Peruvian state of human rights violations, namely that the MRTA insurgents had been denied the \"right to life, the right to judicial guarantees and the right to judicial protection\". The IACHR accepted the case and is currently[when?] studying it.[131] Peruvian Minister of Justice Maria Zavala has stated that this verdict[clarification needed] by the IACHR supports the Peruvian government's extradition of Fujimori from Chile. Though the IACHR verdict does not directly implicate Fujimori, it does fault the Peruvian government for its complicity in the 1992 Cantuta University killings.[132]/nAlberto Fujimori left Peru in November 2000 to attend a regional summit in Brunei.  He then traveled on to Japan.  Once there, he announced plans to remain in the country and faxed his resignation letter to Congress./nAfter Congress rejected Fujimori's faxed resignation, they relieved Fujimori of his duties as president and banned him from Peruvian politics for a decade. He remained in self-imposed exile in Japan,[133] where he resided with his friend, the famous Catholic novelist Ayako Sono.[134] Several senior Japanese politicians have supported Fujimori,[135] partly because of his decisive action in ending the 1996\u201397 Japanese embassy crisis./nAlejandro Toledo, who assumed the Peruvian presidency in 2001, spearheaded the criminal case against Fujimori. He arranged meetings with the Supreme Court, tax authorities, and other powers in Peru to \"coordinate the joint efforts to bring the criminal Fujimori from Japan.\" His vehemence in this matter at times compromised Peruvian law: forcing the judiciary and legislative system to keep guilty sentences without hearing Fujimori's defense; not providing Fujimori with representation when Fujimori was tried in absentia; and expelling pro-Fujimori congressmen from the parliament without proof of the accusations against those congressmen. These expulsions were later reversed by the judiciary.[136]/nThe Peruvian Congress authorized charges against Fujimori in August 2001. Fujimori was alleged to be a coauthor, along with Vladimiro Montesinos, of the death-squad killings at Barrios Altos in 1991 and La Cantuta in 1992, respectively.[137] At the behest of Peruvian authorities, Interpol issued an arrest order for Fujimori on charges that included murder, kidnapping, and crimes against humanity./nMeanwhile, the Peruvian government found that Japan was not amenable to the extradition of Fujimori; a protracted diplomatic debate ensued, when Japan showed itself unwilling to accede to the extradition request. Fujimori had been granted Japanese citizenship after his arrival in the country, and the Japanese government maintained that Japanese citizens would not be extradited.[138]/nIn September 2003, Congressman Dora D\u00e1vila, joined by Minister of Health Luis Soari, denounced Fujimori and several of his ministers for crimes against humanity, for allegedly having overseen forced sterilizations during his regime. In November, Congress approved an investigation of Fujimori's involvement in the airdrop of Kalashnikov rifles into the Colombian jungle in 1999 and 2000 for guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Fujimori maintained he had no knowledge of the arms-trading, and blamed Montesinos. By approving the charges, Congress lifted the immunity granted to Fujimori as a former president, so that he could be criminally charged and prosecuted./nCongress also voted to support charges against Fujimori for the detention and disappearance of 67 students from the central Andean city of Huancayo and the disappearance of several residents from the northern coastal town of Chimbote during the 1990s. It also approved charges that Fujimori mismanaged millions of dollars from Japanese charities, suggesting that the millions of dollars in his bank account were far too much to have been accumulated legally.[139]/nIn 2004, the Special Prosecutor established to investigate Fujimori released a report alleging that the Fujimori administration had obtained US$2\u00a0billion though graft.[140] Most of this money came from Vladimiro Montesinos' web of corruption.[140] The Special Prosecutor's figure of two billion dollars is considerably higher than the one arrived at by Transparency International, an NGO that studies corruption. Transparency International listed Fujimori as having embezzled an estimated US$600\u00a0million or about $861 million in 2021, which would rank seventh in the list of money embezzled by heads of government active within 1984\u20132004.[38][39][141]/nFujimori dismissed the judicial proceedings underway against him as \"politically motivated\", citing Toledo's involvement. Fujimori established a new political party in Peru, S\u00ed Cumple, working from Japan. He hoped to participate in the 2006 presidential elections, but in February 2004, the Constitutional Court dismissed this possibility, because the ex-president was specifically barred by Congress from holding any office for ten years. Fujimori saw the decision as unconstitutional, as did his supporters such as ex-congress members Luz Salgado, Martha Ch\u00e1vez and Fern\u00e1n Altuve, who argued it was a \"political\" maneuver and that the only body with the authority to determine the matter was the Jurado Nacional de Elecciones (JNE). Valent\u00edn Paniagua disagreed, suggesting that the Constitutional Court finding was binding and that \"no further debate is possible\".[142][143]/nFujimori's S\u00ed Cumple (roughly translated, \"He Keeps His Word\") received more than 10% in many country-level polls, contending with APRA for the second place slot,[144] but did not participate in the 2006 elections after its participation in the Alliance for the Future (initially thought as Alliance S\u00ed Cumple) had not been allowed./nBy March 2005, it appeared that Peru had all but abandoned its efforts to extradite Fujimori from Japan. In September of that year, Fujimori obtained a new Peruvian passport in Tokyo and announced his intention to run in the upcoming 2006 national election.[138] He arrived in Chile in November 2005, but hours after his arrival there he was arrested. Peru then requested his extradition./nWhile under house arrest in Chile, Fujimori announced plans to run in Japan's Upper House elections in July 2007 for the far-right People's New Party.[145][146][147][148] Fujimori was extradited from Chile to Peru in September 2007./nOn 7 April 2009, a three-judge panel convicted Fujimori on charges of human rights abuses, declaring that the \"charges against him have been proven beyond all reasonable doubt\".[149] The panel found him guilty of ordering the Grupo Colina death squad to commit the November 1991 Barrios Altos massacre and the July 1992 La Cantuta massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 25 people,[150] as well as for taking part in the kidnappings of Peruvian opposition journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer.[151][152] As of 2009 Fujimori's conviction is the only instance of a democratically elected head of state being tried and convicted of human rights abuses in his own country.[153] Later on 7 April, the court sentenced Fujimori to 25 years in prison.[32] Likewise, the Court found him guilty of aggravated kidnapping, under the aggravating circumstance of cruel treatment, to the detriment of journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer Ampudia. The Special Criminal Chamber determined that the sentence had expired on 10 February 2032.[154] On 2 January 2010, the sentence to 25 years in prison for human rights violations was confirmed.[155]/nHe faced a third trial in July 2009 over allegations that he illegally gave $15\u00a0million in state funds to Vladimiro Montesinos, former head of the National Intelligence Service, during the two months prior to his fall from power. Fujimori admitted paying the money to Montesinos but claimed that he had later paid back the money to the state.[156] On 20 July, the court found him guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to a further seven-and-a-half years in prison.[156][157]/nA fourth trial took place in September 2009 in Lima.[157] Fujimori was accused of using Montesinos to bribe and tap the phones of journalists, businessmen and opposition politicians \u2013 evidence of which led to the collapse of his government in 2000.[157][158] Fujimori admitted the charges but claimed that the charges were made to damage his daughter's presidential election campaign.[158] The prosecution asked the court to sentence Fujimori to eight years imprisonment with a fine of $1.6\u00a0million plus $1\u00a0million in compensation to ten people whose phones were bugged.[158] Fujimori pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment on 30 September 2009.[157] Under Peruvian law, all prison sentences run concurrently./nOn 3 May 2016, the Constitutional Court of Peru rejected the nullity of Alberto Fujimori's conviction. Alberto Fujimori was to continue to be sentenced to 25 years, which was imposed on him for responsibility in the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta massacres./nPress reports in late 2012 indicated that Fujimori was suffering from tongue cancer and other medical problems. His family asked President Ollanta Humala for a pardon.[159] President Humala rejected a pardon in 2013, saying that Fujimori's condition was not serious enough to warrant it.[160] In July 2016, with three days left in his term, President Humala said that there was insufficient time to evaluate a second request to pardon Fujimori, leaving the decision to his successor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.[161][162] On 24 December 2017, President Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds.[163] Kuczynski's office stated that the hospitalized 79-year-old Fujimori had a \"progressive, degenerative and incurable disease\". The pardon kicked off at least two days of protests and led at least three congressmen to resign from Kuczynski's party. A spokesman for Popular Force alleged there was a pact that, in exchange for the pardon, Popular Force members helped Kuczynski fight ongoing impeachment proceedings.[41]/nOn 20 February 2018, the National Criminal Chamber ruled that it did not apply the resolution that granted Fujimori the right of grace for humanitarian reasons. Therefore, the former president had to face the process for the Pativilca Case with a simple appearance.[164] On 3 October 2018, the Peruvian Supreme Court reversed Fujimori's pardon and ordered his return to prison.[165] He was rushed to a hospital and returned to prison on 23 January 2019.[44] His pardon was formally annulled on 13 February 2019.[45]/nThe Constitutional Court of Peru, in a 4\u20133 ruling on 17 March 2022, reinstated the pardon, though it was not clear if or when he may be released.[46] Those ruling in approval of Fujimori's release argued that a pardon, no matter how unconstitutional it may be, can be issued by the President of Peru and that previous rulings annulling the pardon were \"subjective\".[166] Constitutional Court judges ruling in favor of releasing Fujimori ignored the Inter-American Court of Human Rights' opinion that criticized Kuczynski's reported pardon pact with Fujimori's son and pointed out that the disease cited in the pardon was possibly diagnosed by Fujimori's personal doctor, not an independent physician.[166]/nOn 8 April 2022, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights overruled the Constitutional Court and ordered Peru not to release Fujimori.[47]/nOn 5 December 2023, he was ordered to be released immediately following an order by the Constitutional Court of Peru. This followed a previous order by the court that mandated the decision in the hands of a lower court in Ica, which returned the case to the Constitutional Court citing lack of authority.[7] The following day, he was released from Barbadillo prison in Lima, whereupon he was met by his children Keiko and Kenji as well as a crowd of supporters.[8]/nIn May 2023, the Supreme Court of Chile ordered Fujimori to testify regarding forced sterilizations that occurred between 1996 and 2000 during his government, with Chile attempting to decide if they would expand extradition charges against Fujimori to include the sterilizations, which would allow him to be prosecuted in Peru.[167] On 19 May 2023, Fujimori participated in a video call from Barbadillo Prison with justice officials in Chile defending his actions regarding sterilizations.[168]/nFujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the Garc\u00eda years. While it is generally agreed that the \"Fujishock\" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated./nNeoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial \"orthodox\" phase (1990\u201392) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a \"pragmatic\" phase (1993\u201398) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final \"watered-down\" phase (1999\u20132000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their clientelist policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.[169]/nHigh growth during Fujimori's first term petered out during his second term. \"El Ni\u00f1o\" phenomena had a tremendous impact on the Peruvian economy during the late 1990s.[170] Nevertheless, total GDP growth between 1992 and 2001, inclusive, was 44.60%, that is, 3.76% per annum; total GDP per capita growth between 1991 and 2001, inclusive, was 30.78%, that is, 2.47% per annum. Also, studies by INEI, the national statistics bureau[171] show that the number of Peruvians living in poverty increased dramatically (from 41.6% to more than 70%) during Alan Garc\u00eda's term, but decreased greatly (from more than 70% to 54%) during Fujimori's term. Furthermore, FAO reported Peru reduced undernourishment by about 29% from 1990 to 1992 to 1997\u201399.[172]/nPeru was reintegrated into the global economic system, and began to attract foreign investment. The mass selloff of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephone, mobile telephone, and internet services, respectively. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company at a cost of $607 for a residential line.[173][174] A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days. Peru's Physical land based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000,[175] and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line. Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization).[176] Privatization also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea Gas Project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.[177]/nFujimori has been described as a dictator.[6][178] His government was permeated by a network of corruption organized by his associate Montesinos.[179][180][181] Fujimori's style of government has also been described as \"populist authoritarianism\". Numerous governments[182] and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, welcomed the extradition of Fujimori to face human rights charges.[183] As early as 1991, Fujimori had himself vocally denounced what he called \"pseudo-human rights organizations\" such as Amnesty International and Americas Watch, for allegedly failing to criticize the insurgencies targeting civilian populations throughout Peru against which his government was struggling.[184]/nSome analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years actually reflects a greater rate of extraction of nonrenewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.[185][186][187][188] Peru's mining legislation, they claim, has served as a role model for other countries that wish to become more mining-friendly.[189]/nFujimori's privatization program also remains shrouded in controversy and opposed by many Peruvians. A congressional investigation in 2002, led by socialist opposition congressman Javier Diez Canseco, stated that of the US$9\u00a0billion raised through the privatizations of hundreds of state-owned enterprises, only a small fraction of this income ever benefited the Peruvian people.[citation needed]/nThe sole instance of organized labor's success in impeding reforms, namely the teacher's union resistance to education reform, was based on traditional methods of organization and resistance: strikes and street demonstrations.[169]/nIn the 2004 Global Corruption Report, Fujimori made into the list of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders. He was listed seventh and he was said to have amassed $600\u00a0million, but despite years of incarceration and investigation, none of these supposed stolen funds have ever been located in any bank account anywhere in the world.[190][191]/nFujimori did have support within Peru. The Universidad de Lima March 2003 poll, taken while he was in Japan, found a 41% approval rating for his administration.[192] A poll conducted in March 2005 by the Instituto de Desarrollo e Investigaci\u00f3n de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas (IDICE) indicated that 12.1% of the respondents intended to vote for Fujimori in the 2006 presidential election.[193] A poll conducted on 25 November 2005, by the Universidad de Lima indicated a high approval (45.6%) rating of the Fujimori period between 1990 and 2000, attributed to his counterinsurgency efforts (53%).[194] An article from La Razon, a Peruvian newspaper, stated in 2003 that: \"Fujimori is only guilty of one big crime and it is that of having been successful in a country of failed politicians, creators of debt, builders of mirages, and the downright opportunistic.\"/nAccording to a more recent Universidad de Lima survey, Fujimori still retains public support, ranking fifth in personal popularity among other political figures. Popular approval for his decade-long presidency (1990\u20132000) has reportedly grown (from 31.5% in 2002 to 49.5% in May 2007).[195] Despite accusations of corruption and human rights violations, nearly half of the individuals interviewed in the survey approved of Fujimori's presidential regime.[citation needed] In a 2007 Universidad de Lima survey of 600 Peruvians in Lima and the port of Callao, 82.6% agreed that the former president should be extradited from Chile to stand trial in Peru.[196]/nThe Lima-based newspaper Per\u00fa 21 ran an editorial noting that even though the Universidad de Lima poll results indicate that four out of every five interviewees believe that Fujimori is guilty of some of the charges against him, he still enjoys at least 30% of popular support and enough approval to restart a political career./nIn the 2006 congressional elections, his daughter Keiko was elected to the congress with the highest vote count. She came in second place in the 2011 Peruvian presidential election with 23.2% of the vote,[197] and lost the June runoff against Ollanta Humala.[198] She again ran for President in the 2016 election, narrowly losing the runoff to Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, and again in the 2021 election, losing the runoff to Pedro Castillo.", "23938052": "Jan Waszkiewicz (June 24, 1944 \u2013 March 25, 2021)[3][4] was a Polish politician[5] and regional official, academic, and marshal of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship./nHe graduated from the University of Wroc\u0142aw in 1966.

Other stars include Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Mahershala Ali, Aldis Hodge, and Glen Powell./nPrincipal photography began in March 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia and wrapped up in May 2016. Other filming locations included several other locations in Georgia, including East Point, Canton, Monroe, Columbus, and Madison./nHidden Figures had a limited release on December 25, 2016, by 20th Century Fox, before going wide in North America on January 6, 2017. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances (particularly Henson, Spencer and Mon\u00e1e), the writing, direction, cinematography, emotional tone, and historical accuracy, although some argued it featured a white savior narrative. The film was a commercial success, grossing $236 million worldwide against its $25 million production budget. Deadline Hollywood noted it as one of the most profitable releases of 2016, and estimated that it made a net profit of $95.5 million.[4]/nThe film was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 2016[5] and received various awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture./nKatherine Johnson works at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, in 1961, alongside her colleagues Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan, as lowly \"computers\", performing math calculations without being told what they are for. All of them are African-American women; the unit is segregated by race and sex. White supervisor Vivian Mitchell assigns Katherine to assist Al Harrison's Space Task Group, given her skills in analytic geometry. She becomes the first Black woman on the team; head engineer Paul Stafford is especially dismissive./nMary is assigned to the space capsule heat shield team, where she immediately identifies a design flaw. Encouraged by her team leader Karl Zielinski, a Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivor, Mary applies for a NASA engineer position. She is told by Mitchell that, regardless of her mathematics and physical science degree, the position requires additional courses. Mary files a petition for permission to attend all-white Hampton High School, despite her husband's opposition. Pleading her case in court, she wins over the local judge by appealing to his sense of history, allowing her to attend night classes./nKatherine meets African-American National Guard Lt. Col. Jim Johnson, who voices skepticism about women's mathematical abilities. He later apologizes and begins spending time with Katherine and her three daughters. The Mercury 7 astronauts visit Langley, and astronaut John Glenn goes out of his way to greet the West Area women. Katherine impresses Harrison by solving a complex mathematical equation from redacted documents, as the Soviet Union's successful launch of Yuri Gagarin increases pressure to send American astronauts into space./nHarrison confronts Katherine about her \"breaks,\" unaware that she is forced to walk half a mile (800 meters) to use the nearest bathroom assigned to \"Colored\" people. She angrily explains the discrimination she faces at work, which leads Harrison to knock down the \"Colored Bathroom\" sign and abolish bathroom segregation. He allows Katherine to be included in high-level meetings to calculate the space capsule's re-entry point. Stafford makes Katherine remove her name from reports, insisting that \"computers\" cannot author them, and her work is credited solely to Stafford./nInformed by Mitchell that there are no plans to assign a \"permanent supervisor for the colored group,\" Dorothy learns NASA has installed an IBM 7090 electronic computer that threatens to replace human computers. When a librarian scolds her for visiting the whites-only section, Dorothy takes a book about Fortran and teaches herself and her West Area co-workers programming. She visits the computer room, successfully starts the machine, and is promoted to supervise the Programming Department; she agrees to do so if thirty of her co-workers are transferred as well. Mitchell finally addresses her as \"Mrs. Vaughan\"./nMaking final arrangements for John Glenn's launch, the department no longer needs human computers; Katherine is reassigned to the West Area and marries Jim. On the day of the launch, discrepancies are found in the IBM 7090 calculations, and Katherine is asked to check the capsule's landing coordinates. She delivers the results to the control room, and Harrison allows her inside. After a successful launch and orbit, a warning indicates the capsule's heat shield may be loose. Mission Control decides to land Glenn after three orbits instead of seven, and Katherine supports Harrison's suggestion to leave the retro-rocket attached to help keep the heat shield in place. Friendship 7 lands successfully./nThough the mathematicians are ultimately replaced by electronic computers, a textual epilogue reveals Mary obtained her engineering degree and became NASA's first female African American engineer; Dorothy continued as NASA's first African American supervisor; and Katherine, accepted by Stafford as a report coauthor, went on to calculate the trajectories for the Apollo 11 and Space Shuttle missions.

Spencer was selected to play Dorothy Vaughan, one of the three lead mathematicians at NASA.[9] Kevin Costner was cast in the film to play the fictional head of the space program.[10] Singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e signed on to play the third lead mathematician, Mary Jackson.[11] Kirsten Dunst, Glen Powell, and Mahershala Ali were cast in the film: Powell to play astronaut John Glenn,[12] and Ali as Johnson's love interest.[13][14]/nPrincipal photography began in March 2016 on the campus of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia.[15] Scenes were also shot on location in Historic Downtown Canton, Georgia.[16] Filming also took place at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.[17] Jim Parsons was cast in the film to play the head engineer of the Space Task Group at NASA, Paul Stafford.[12] Pharrell Williams (a native of Virginia Beach, near Langley Research Center[18]) came on board as a producer on the film. He also wrote original songs and handled the music department and soundtrack of the film, with Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch.[19] Morehouse College mathematics professor Rudy L. Horne was brought in to be the on-set mathematician./nThe film, set at NASA Langley Research Center in 1961, depicts segregated facilities such as the West Area Computing unit, where an all-Black group of female mathematicians were originally required to use separate dining and bathroom facilities. However, in reality, Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to supervisor of West Computing much earlier, in 1949, becoming the first Black supervisor at the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and one of its few female supervisors. In 1958, when NACA became NASA, segregated facilities, including the West Computing office, were abolished.[20] Vaughan and many of the former West computers transferred to the new Analysis and Computation Division (ACD), a racially and gender-integrated group.[21]/nIt was Mary Jackson, not Katherine Johnson, who had difficulty finding a colored bathroom \u2014 in a 1953 incident she experienced while on temporary assignment in the East Area, a region of Langley unfamiliar to her and where few Blacks worked.[22] Katherine Johnson, for her part, was initially unaware that the bathrooms at Langley were segregated (in both its East and West areas during the NACA era), and used the \"whites-only\" bathrooms (many were not explicitly labeled as such) for years before anyone complained. She ignored the complaint, and the issue was dropped.[23][24]/nIn an interview with WHRO-TV, Johnson denied the feelings of segregation. \"I didn't feel the segregation at NASA, because everybody there was doing research. You had a mission and you worked on it, and it was important to you to do your job ... and play bridge at lunch. I didn't feel any segregation. I knew it was there, but I didn't feel it.\"[25]/nMary Jackson did not have to get a court order to attend night classes at the whites-only high school. She asked the city of Hampton for an exception, and it was granted. The school turned out to be run down and dilapidated, a hidden cost of running two parallel school systems.[26] She completed her engineering courses and earned a promotion to engineer in 1958.[27]/nKatherine Johnson worked mostly in Langley's West Area, not the East Area \u2014 working mainly in Building 1244 starting in mid-1953, and remaining in 1244 even after joining the Space Task Group, through at least the early 1960s and John Glenn's historic flight.[28][29][30]/nThe scene where a coffeepot labeled \"colored\" appears in Katherine Johnson's workplace did not happen in real life, and the book on which the film is based mentions no such incident./nKatherine Johnson carpooled with Eunice Smith, a nine-year West Area computer veteran at the time Johnson joined NACA. Smith was her neighbor and friend from her sorority and church choir.[31] The three Goble children were teenagers at the time of Katherine's marriage to Jim Johnson.[32]/nKatherine Johnson was assigned to the Flight Research Division in 1953, a move that soon became permanent. When the Space Task Group was created in 1958, engineers from the Flight Research Division formed the core of the group, and Johnson was included. She coauthored a research report published by NASA in 1960, the first time a woman in the Flight Research Division had received credit as an author of a research report.[33] Johnson gained access to editorial meetings as of 1958 simply through persistence, not because one particular meeting was critical.[34][35]/nThe Space Task Group was led by Robert Gilruth, not the fictional character Al Harrison, who was created to simplify a more complex management structure. The scene where Harrison smashes the Colored Ladies Room sign never happened, as in real life Johnson refused to walk the extra distance to use the colored bathroom and, in her words, \"just went to the white one.\"[36] Harrison also lets her into Mission Control to witness the launch. Neither scene happened in real life, and screenwriter Theodore Melfi said he saw no problem with adding the scenes, saying, \"There needs to be white people who do the right thing, there needs to be Black people who do the right thing, and someone does the right thing. And so who cares who does the right thing, as long as the right thing is achieved?\"[37]/nDexter Thomas of Vice News criticized Melfi's additions as creating the white savior trope: \"In this case, it means that a white person doesn't have to think about the possibility that, were they around back in the 1960s South, they might have been one of the bad ones.\"[38] The Atlantic's Megan Garber said that the film's \"narrative trajectory\" involved \"thematic elements of the white savior\".[39] Melfi said he found \"hurtful\" the \"accusations of a 'white savior' storyline\", saying:/nIt was very upsetting to me because I am at a place where I've lived my life colorless and I grew up in Brooklyn. I walked to school with people of all shapes, sizes, and colors, and that's how I've lived my life. So it's very upsetting that we still have to have this conversation. I get upset when I hear 'Black film,' and so does Taraji P. Henson ... It's just a film. And if we keep labeling something 'a Black film,' or 'a white film'\u2014 basically it's modern day segregation. We're all humans. Any human can tell any human's story. I don't want to have this conversation about Black film or white film anymore. I wanna have conversations about film./nThe Huffington Post's Zeba Blay said of Melfi's frustration:/nHis frustration is also a perfect example of how, when it comes to open dialogue about depictions of people of color on screen, it behooves white people (especially those who position themselves as 'allies') to listen ... the inclusion of the bathroom scene doesn't make Melfi a bad filmmaker, or a bad person, or a racist. But his suggestion that a feel-good scene like that was needed for the marketability and overall appeal of the film speaks to the fact that Hollywood at large still has a long way to go in telling Black stories, no matter how many strides have been made.[40]/nThe fictional characters Vivian Mitchell and Paul Stafford are composites of several team members and reflect common social views and attitudes of the time. Karl Zielinski is based on Mary Jackson's mentor, Kazimierz \"Kaz\" Czarnecki.[41]/nJohn Glenn, who was about a decade older than depicted at the time of launch, did ask specifically for Johnson[42] to verify the IBM calculations, although she had several days before the launch date to complete the process.[43]/nAuthor Margot Lee Shetterly has agreed that there are differences between her book and the movie, but found that to be understandable./nFor better or for worse, there is history, there is the book and then there's the movie. Timelines had to be conflated and [there were] composite characters, and for most people [who have seen the movie] have already taken that as the literal fact. ... You might get the indication in the movie that these were the only people doing those jobs, when in reality we know they worked in teams, and those teams had other teams. There were sections, branches, divisions, and they all went up to a director. There were so many people required to make this happen. ... It would be great for people to understand that there were so many more people. Even though Katherine Johnson, in this role, was a hero, there were so many others that were required to do other kinds of tests and checks to make [Glenn's] mission come to fruition. But I understand you can't make a movie with 300 characters. It is simply not possible.[44]/nJohn Glenn's flight was not terminated early as stated in the movie's closing subtitles. The MA-6 mission was planned for three orbits and landed at the expected time. The press kit published before launch states that \"The Mercury Operations Director may elect a one, two or three orbit mission.\"[45] The post-mission report also shows that retrofire was scheduled to occur on the third orbit.[46] Scott Carpenter's subsequent flight in May was also scheduled and flew for three orbits, and Wally Schirra's planned six-orbit flight in October required extensive modifications to the Mercury capsule's life-support system to allow him to fly a nine-hour mission.[47] The phrase \"go for at least seven orbits\" that is in the mission transcript refers to the fact that the Atlas booster had placed Glenn's capsule into an orbit that would be stable for at least seven orbits, not that he had permission to stay up that long./nThe Mercury Control Center was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida, not at the Langley Research Center in Virginia. The orbit plots displayed in the front of the room incorrectly show a six-orbit mission, which did not happen until Wally Schirra's MA-8 mission in October 1962. The movie also incorrectly shows NASA flight controllers monitoring live telemetry from the Soviet Vostok launch, which the Soviet Union would not have been sharing with NASA in 1961./nKatherine Johnson's Technical Note D-233, co-written with T.H. Skopinski, can be found on the NASA Technical Reports Server.[48]/nThe movie depicts the IBM 7090 as the first computer at Langley, but there were actually earlier[49]:\u200a138\u200a computers there, and Dorothy Vaughan had previously[49]:\u200a205\u2013206\u200a been programming for the IBM 704 in FORTRAN./nThe movie refers to an IBM 7090, but the console shown is for an IBM 7094, which came later./nThe film began a limited release on December 25, 2016, before a wide release on January 6, 2017.[50][51]/nAfter Hidden Figures was released on December 25, 2016, certain charities, institutions and independent businesses who regard the film as relevant to the cause of improving youth awareness in education and careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, organized free screenings of the film in order to spread the message of the film's subject matter.[52] A collaborative effort between Western New York STEM Hub, AT&T and the Girl Scouts of the USA allowed more than 200 Buffalo Public School students, Girl Scouts and teachers to see the film. WBFO's Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley stated the event was designed to help encourage a new generation of women to consider STEM careers. Research indicates that by 2020, there will be 2.4 million unfilled STEM jobs.[53] Aspiring astronaut Naia Butler-Craig wrote of the film: \"I can't imagine what that would have been like: 16-year-old, impressionable, curious and space-obsessed Naia finding out that Black women had something to do with getting Americans on the moon.\"[54]/nAlso, the film's principal actors (Henson, Spencer, Mon\u00e1e and Parsons), director (Melfi), producer/musical creator (Williams), and other non-profit outside groups have offered free screenings to Hidden Figures at several cinema locations around the world. Some of the screenings were open to all-comers, while others were arranged to benefit girls, women and the underprivileged. The campaign began as individual activism by Spencer, and made a total of more than 1,500 seats for Hidden Figures available, free of charge, to poor individuals and families. The result was seven more screenings for people who otherwise might not have been able to afford to see the film - in Atlanta (sponsored by Mon\u00e1e), in Washington, D.C. (sponsored by Henson), in Chicago (also Henson), in Houston (by Parsons), in Hazelwood, Missouri (by Melfi and actress/co-producer Kimberly Quinn), and in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia (both sponsored by Williams).[55]/nIn February 2017, AMC Theatres and 21st Century Fox announced that free screenings of Hidden Figures would take place in celebration of Black History Month in up to 14 select U.S. cities (including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami). The statement described the February charity screenings as building broader awareness of the film's true story of Black women mathematicians who worked at NASA during the Space Race.[56] 21st Century Fox and AMC Theatres also invited schools, community groups and non-profit organizations to apply for additional special screenings to be held in their towns. \"As we celebrate Black History Month and look ahead to Women's History Month in March, this story of empowerment and perseverance is more relevant than ever,\" said Liba Rubenstein, 21st Century Fox's Senior Vice President of Social Impact, \"We at 21CF were inspired by the grassroots movement to bring this film to audiences that wouldn't otherwise be able to see it - audiences that might include future innovators and barrier-breakers - and we wanted to support and extend that movement\".[57]/nPhilanthropic non-profit outside groups and other local efforts by individuals have offered free screenings of Hidden Figures by using crowdfunding platforms on the Internet, that allow people to raise money for free film screening events.[58][59] Dozens of other GoFundMe free screening campaigns have appeared since the film's general release, all by people wanting to raise money to pay for students to see the film.[58]/nIn 2019, The Walt Disney Company partnered with the U.S. Department of State on the third annual \"Hidden No More\" exchange program, which was inspired by the film and brings to the United States 50 women from around the world who have excelled in STEM careers such as spacecraft engineering, data solutions and data privacy, and STEM-related education.[60] The exchange program began in 2017 after local US embassies screened the film to their local communities. The support for the screenings was so positive that 48 countries decided to each nominate one women in STEM to represent their country on a three-week IVLP exchange program in the United States.[61]/nFollowing the 2017 Lego Ideas Contest, Denmark-based toy maker The Lego Group announced plans to manufacture a fan-designed Women of NASA figurine set of five female scientists, engineers and astronauts, as based on real women who have worked for NASA. The minifigures planned for inclusion in the set were Katherine Johnson, computer scientist Margaret Hamilton; astronaut, physicist and educator Sally Ride; astronomer Nancy Grace Roman; and astronaut and physician Mae Jemison (who is also African American). The finished set did not include Johnson. The Women of NASA set was released November 1, 2017.[62][63][64]/nThe Miracles' 1961 chart hit, \"Mighty Good Lovin'\", written by lead singer Smokey Robinson, is played in the film during the house party dance scene, and was also heard in the closing credits.[65][66]/nHidden Figures was released on Digital HD on March 28, 2017, and Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD, and DVD on April 11, 2017.[67] The film debuted at No. 3 on the home video sales chart.[68]/nHidden Figures grossed $169.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $66.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide gross of $236 million, against a production budget of $25 million.[3] Domestically, Hidden Figures was the highest-grossing Best Picture nominee at the 89th Academy Awards.[69] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $95.55 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top twenty most profitable release of 2016.[4]/nDuring its limited release in 25 theaters from December 25, 2016, to January 5, 2017, the film grossed $3 million.[3] In North America, Hidden Figures had its expansion alongside the opening of Underworld: Blood Wars and the wide expansions of Lion and A Monster Calls. It was expected to gross around $20 million from 2,471 theaters in its opening weekend, with the studio projecting a more conservative $15\u201317 million debut.[70] It made $1.2 million from Thursday night previews and $7.6 million on its first day. Initially, projections had the film grossing $21.8 million in its opening weekend, finishing second behind Rogue One: A Star Wars Story ($22 million). However the next day, final figures revealed the film tallied a weekend total of $22.8 million, beating Rogue One's $21.9 million.[71] In its second weekend, the film grossed $20.5 million (for a four-day MLK Weekend total of $27.5 million), again topping the box office.[72]/nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% based on 314 reviews, with an average rating of 7.64/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"In heartwarming, crowd-pleasing fashion, Hidden Figures celebrates overlooked\u2014and crucial\u2014contributions from a pivotal moment in American history.\"[73] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[74] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale,[75] one of fewer than 90 films in the history of the service to receive such a score.[71]/nSimon Thompson of IGN gave the film a rating of nine out of ten, writing, \"Hidden Figures fills in an all too forgotten, or simply too widely unknown, blank in US history in a classy, engaging, entertaining and hugely fulfilling way. Superb performances across the board and a fascinating story alone make Hidden Figures a solid, an accomplished and deftly executed movie that entertains, engages and earns your time, money and attention.\"[76] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote, \"the film's made with more heart than art and more skill than subtlety, and it works primarily because of the women that it portrays and the actresses who portray them. Best of all, you come out of the movie knowing who Katherine Johnson and Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson are, and so do your daughters and sons.\"[77]/nClayton Davis of Awards Circuit gave the film three and a half stars, saying \"Precisely marketed as terrific adult entertainment for the Christmas season, Hidden Figures is a faithful and truly beautiful portrait of our country's consistent gloss over the racial tensions that have divided and continue to plague the fabric of our existence.

The film is not to be missed.\"[78]/nOther reviews criticized the film for its fictional embellishments and conventional, feel-good style. Tim Grierson, writing for Screen International, states that \"Hidden Figures is almost patronisingly earnest in its depiction of sexism and racism. An air of do-gooder self-satisfaction hovers over the proceedings\",[79] while Jesse Hassenger at The A.V. Club comments that \"lack of surprise is in this movie's bones.\"[80] Eric Kohn of IndieWire argues that the film \"trivializes history; as a hagiographic tribute to its brilliant protagonists, it doesn't dig into the essence of their struggles\"[81] and similarly, Paul Byrnes concludes that \"When a film purports to be selling history, we're entitled to ask where the history went, even if it offers a good time instead.\"[82]/nAmong its many achievements, Octavia Spencer was particularly lauded for her portrayal of Dorothy Vaughan and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture and Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.

She then stayed at Bedford until 1916, initially as a lecturer in mathematics and physics. From 1892 to 1894 she also worked as 'resident helper' at the college, received free board and lodging in return. Later she also helped out in Greek and Latin classes./nLee was born on June 28, 1859 to William Lee(1821-1887) a master coach builder and Matilda Wren Baker(1822-1903).[5] Lee became a student at Bedford College, the first college to provide education for girls in United Kingdom. Due to increased demand, Lee attended the first higher mathematics education at Bedford from 1879 to 1890.[6] From about 1895 Lee attended Karl Pearson's statistics lectures at University College London and became interested in his application of statistical methods to evolutionary biology. Under his direction she studied for an advanced degree. Her research topic was an investigation of variation in cranial capacity in humans and its correlation with intellectual ability. Lee courted controversy with her first published paper on the subject in 1901 A study of the correlation of the human skull.[4] She examined three groups - women students from Bedford College, male faculty at University College, and a collection of distinguished male anatomists. The study demonstrated that there was no correlation between skull size and intelligence. Through a formula Lee calculated the cranial capacity from the anatomical measurements. The individuals in the groups were ranked in order of decreasing skull size, and identified by name. The dissertation was completed in 1899 and the findings caused considerable controversy. It was then an accepted theory in craniology that brain power increased with size, hence skull capacity was a measure of mental ability. As a consequence it was believed that men, who generally had larger heads than women, were mentally superior. Lee's findings shed doubt on that belief. Furthermore, one of the examiners of her dissertation was an anatomist with a low ranking in the skull capacity table of her study.[4] Lee's study drew considerable criticism from her thesis examiners and from eugenicist Francis Galton, who questioned the originality and the scientific quality of her work.[4] It was through Pearson's intervention that Lee was finally awarded a PhD in 1901. The following year Pearson published two papers which answered to the criticism that had been levelled at the findings of Lee's study. As there were no effective challenges this work was soon accepted.[7]/nFrom 1892 Lee worked in Pearson's biometric laboratory.[4] Initially as volunteer,[8] Lee eventually received a salary of \u00a390 a year and worked three days a week. Her duties included reducing data, computing correlation coefficients, creating histogram bar charts, and calculating new kind of chi-squared distribution statistics. In addition she did \"all the hundred and one things that need doing\" and acted as a laboratory secretary. Pearson funded her salary though a grant and showed embarrassment that compared to the salary of a female typist or stenographer Lee was not well paid. On the same grant Pearson also hired the sisters Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave and Frances Cave-Browne-Cave as part-time computers.[8] Lee held the paid position in the laboratory until 1907 and kept her lectureship at Bredford College until 1916. She carried out laboratory work in her spare time, or on a voluntary basis in Pearson's laboratory.[7]/nWhile working in the laboratory Lee had started to pursue her own research projects. She published four papers in her own name and contributed to 26 others.[8] Twice she declined to be listed as a co-author of a paper published by Pearson, arguing that she had only done the arithmetic. She was in the process of establishing a reputation as a statistician. For her dissertation she had developed a statistical model that estimated the cranial volume of living humans from external skull measurements.[8] Her research on the statistical analysis of within species variation, a branch of evolutionary biology, continued until 1910 and led her to publish a succession of papers in the Biometrika from 1902 onwards. Lee's work also contributed to the preparation of tabulated functions, which were frequently used by contemporary statisticians and biologists. Her first and second publication on tabulated functions was published in the Reports of the British Science Association in 1896 and 1899. Later works on the subject were published in the Biometrika between 1914 and 1927.[7]/nDuring the First World War Lee undertook statistical work for the government. From 1916 till 1918 she also calculated shell trajectories and compiled tables of all kinds for the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of the Munitions Inventions Department. Lee also worked on special computing projects for the Admiralty.[7]/nLee's salary at Bedford College had always been a \"women's wage\", and the pension scheme had started too late for her to join. When she retired she had little to live on. In 1923 Pearson and Margaret Tuke, the former principal of Bedford College, petitioned the Home Office. Pearson emphasised her considerable research contribution, and her \"services to the cause of scientific work\". She was awarded a Civil List pension of \u00a370 a year. She died in 1939 at the age of 80.[7]/nGloria Steinem has credited Lee with dealing one of several death blows to craniology in the early 20th century.[9] Flaws in craniology had been pointed out in the 19th century, but in the 1900s craniology was discredited by empirical data. The final blow came in 1909 when Franklin P. Mall applied statistical measures to the study of the frontal lobe and fissures of the human brain, which had been associated with racial and sex differences, in his paper On several anatomical characters of the human brain, said to vary according to race and sex, with especial reference to the weight of the frontal lobe.

In 1936 he matriculated at Tsing Hua University in Beijing./nOn 7 July 1937 Japanese and Chinese troops clashed near Peking. In late July further fighting broke out and the Japanese quickly captured Peking and Tientsin. Tsing Hua University was moved to Southwest China where it was amalgamated with Nankai and Peking universities. Wang had to journey to the new site of his university and begin his studies again. Perhaps the political events had a positive effect as far as mathematics was concerned since Wang changed his studies to mathematics when he took them up again at the re-established university.\nWang graduated in 1941 and began to study under S S Chern. He was awarded a master's degree in 1944 and began teaching in a school. However, after one year, he was awarded a British Council Scholarship to continue his studies in England.

Her progressive ideas on education, as expounded in The Preparation of the Child for Science, included encouraging children to explore mathematics through playful activities such as curve stitching. Her life is of interest to feminists as an example of how women made careers in an academic system that did not welcome them.[1]/nShe was born in England, the daughter of Reverend Thomas Roupell Everest, Rector of Wickwar, and Mary nee Ryall. Her uncle was George Everest, the surveyor and geographer after whom Mount Everest was named. She spent the first part of her life in France where she received an education in mathematics from a private tutor. On returning to England at the age of 11, she continued to pursue her interest in mathematics through self-instruction. Self-taught mathematician George Boole tutored her, and she visited him in Ireland where he held the position of professor of mathematics at Queen's College Cork. Upon the death of her father in 1855, they married and she moved to Cork. Mary greatly contributed as an editor to Boole's The Laws of Thought, a work on algebraic logic. She had five daughters with him./nShe was widowed in 1864, at the age of 32, and returned to England, where she was offered a post as a librarian at Queen's College on Harley Street, London. In August 1865, her address was listed as 68 Harley Street in a Deed of Assignment in which she disposed of her husband's former house in Ireland, acting as the Executrix of his will.[2] The deed was witnessed by \"John Knights, Porter at Queens College, Harley Street, London and Jane White, Housekeeper at 68 Harley Street, London\". As well as working as a librarian, she also tutored privately in mathematics and developed a philosophy of teaching that involved the use of natural materials and physical activities to encourage an imaginative conception of the subject. Her interest extended beyond mathematics to Darwinian theory, philosophy and psychology and she organised discussion groups on these subjects among others. At Queen's College, against the approval of the authorities, she organised discussion groups of students with the unconventional James Hinton, a promulgator of polygamy. This in part led to her mental breakdown and the dispersal of her children.[3]/nIn later life, she belonged to the circle of the Tolstoyan pacifist publisher, C. W. Daniel; she chose the name The Crank for his magazine because, she said, 'a crank was a little thing that made revolutions'.[4]/nMary took an active interest in politics, introducing her daughter Ethel to the Russian anti-tsarist cause under Sergei Stepniak. After the Boer war 1899-1902 she became more outspoken in her writings against imperialism, organised religion, the financial world and the tokenism she felt that Parliament represented. She opposed women's suffrage and probably for this reason has not generally been regarded as a feminist.[3] She died in 1916, at the age of 84./nBoole was a practitioner of homeopathic medicine.[5]/nMary first became interested in mathematics and teaching through her tutor in France, Monsieur Deplace. He helped her understand mathematics through questioning and journal writing. After marrying George Boole she began contributing to the scientific world by advising her husband in his work while attending his lectures, both of which were unheard of for a woman to do in that time period.[6] During this time she also shared ideas with Victoria Welby, another female scholar and dear friend. They discussed everything from logic and mathematics, to pedagogy, theology, and science.[7]/nHer teaching first began while working as a librarian. Mary would tutor students with new methods; using natural objects, such as sticks or stones. She theorized that using physical manipulations would strengthen the unconscious understanding of materials learned in a classroom setting.[6] One of her most notable contributions in the area of physical manipulations is curve stitching with the use of sewing cards, which she discovered as a form of amusement as a child.[8] This helped to encourage the connections of mathematical concepts to outside sources./nHer book Philosophy and Fun of Algebra explained algebra and logic to children in interesting ways, starting with a fable, and including bits of history throughout.[9] She references not only history, but also philosophy and literature, using a mystical tone to keep the attention of children.[10]  Mary encouraged the use of mathematical imagination with critical thinking and creativity. This, along with reflective journal writing and creating one's own formulas, was essential in strengthening comprehension and understanding. Cooperative learning was also important because students could share discoveries with each other in an environment of peer tutoring and develop new ideas and methods.[6]/nShe worked on promoting her husband's works, with great attention to mathematical psychology. George Boole's main focus was on psychologism, and Mary provided a more ideological view of his work. She supported the idea that arithmetic was not purely abstract as many believed, but more anthropomorphic. Pulsation was also important in her works and could be described as a sequence of mental attitudes, with her attention being analysis and synthesis.[8] She believed that Indian logic played a role in the development of modern logic by her husband George Boole and others.[11]/nBoole was interested in parapsychology and the occult, and was a convinced spiritualist. She was the first female member of the Society for Psychical Research which she joined in 1882. However, being the only female member at the time, she resigned after six months.[12]/nBoole was the author of the book The Message of Psychic Science for Mothers and Nurses. She revealed the manuscript to Frederick Denison Maurice who objected to its controversial ideas and this resulted in her losing her job as librarian at Queens College.[13] The book was not published until 1883.[14] It was later republished as The Message of Psychic Science to the World (1908)./nHer five daughters made their marks in a range of fields. Alicia Boole Stott (1860\u20131940) became an expert in four-dimensional geometry. Ethel Lilian (1864\u20131960) married the Polish revolutionary Wilfrid Michael Voynich and was the author of a number of works including The Gadfly. Mary Ellen married mathematician Charles Hinton and Margaret (1858\u20131935) was the mother of mathematician G. I. Taylor. Lucy Everest (1862\u20131905) was a talented chemist and became the first woman Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry.[15]Geoffrey Hinton is a great grandson of Boole, and is well known for research in Artificial Intelligence (AI).", "70468783": "James Barker Coykendall IV is an American mathematician./nCoykendall earned his bachelor's degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1989 and completed a doctorate at Cornell University in 1995.[1][2] His thesis, titled Normsets and Rings of Algebraic Integers, was overseen by Shankar Sen.[3][4] Coykendall's teaching career began the next year at North Dakota State University, where he was named James A.
