By the time he was six, they were orphans, their father dying in 1616 and their mother the following year. John Pell the elder had a fine library, which proved valuable to the young Pell as he grew up. He was educated at Steyning Grammar School and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of 13.[1] During his university career he became an accomplished linguist; even before taking a B.A. degree in 1629, he corresponded with Henry Briggs and other mathematicians. He was promoted by seniority to M.A. in 1630 and taught in the short-lived Chichester Academy set up by Samuel Hartlib.[2][3] On 3 July 1632 he married Ithamaria Reginald (also rendered as Ithamara or Ithumaria, with the surname Reginolles), sister of the writer and polymath Bathsua Makin.[4] They had four sons and four daughters. Ithumaria died in 1661. Some time before 1669 Pell remarried./nPell spent much of the 1630s working under Hartlib's influence, on topics in the area of pedagogy, encyclopedism and pansophy, combinatorics, and the legacy of Trithemius. By 1638 he had formulated a proposal for a universal language.[5] In mathematics, he concentrated on expanding the scope of algebra in the theory of equations, and on mathematical tables.[6] As part of a joint lobbying effort with Hartlib to find himself support to continue as a researcher, he had his short Idea of Mathematics printed in October 1638.[6] It brought interested responses from Johann Moriaen and Marin Mersenne.[7]/nHis reputation and the influence of Sir William Boswell, the English resident, with the States-General procured his election in 1644 to the chair of mathematics in Amsterdam, after an earlier attempt immediately after Martin van den Hove left for Leiden had failed.[8] From 1644 he worked on a polemical work, against Longomontanus. For this he put in a large effort soliciting help and testimonials: from Bonaventura Cavalieri, his patron Sir Charles Cavendish, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Mersenne, Claude Mydorge, and Gilles de Roberval. It finally appeared as Controversy with Longomontanus concerning the Quadrature of the Circle (1647).[9][10]/nIn 1646, on the invitation of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, Pell accepted a professorship at the new Orange College at Breda, where he taught until 1652. He realised that war between the English and the Dutch was imminent and that he would be in an extremely difficult position in Breda, so returned to England before the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in July 1652. After his return, Oliver Cromwell appointed Pell to a post teaching mathematics in London./nFrom 1654 to 1658 Pell acted as Cromwell's political agent in Zurich to the Protestant cantons of Switzerland; he cooperated with Samuel Morland, the English resident at Geneva.[11] Pell was described in Zurich by the English traveller Sir John Reresby in about 1656 as \"a strange unknown person, not unsuiting the people he was sent to, nor the master [Cromwell] he came from. They are here so strict in their religion, they suffer not the Venetian ambassador to hear mass in his own house.\"[12] Cromwell wanted to split the Protestant cantons of Switzerland off to join a Protestant League, with England at its head. However Pell's negotiations were long drawn out and he returned to England to deliver his report only shortly before Cromwell's death. He was unable to report as he waited in vain for an audience with the ailing Cromwell./nA mathematical pupil and disciple in Switzerland, from 1657, was Johann Heinrich Rahn, known as Rhonius.[13] Rahn is credited with the invention of the division sign (\u00f7) from one of the classic symbols for Obelus; it has also been attributed to Pell, who taught Rahn a three-column spreadsheet-style technique of tabulation of calculations, and acted as editor for Rahn's 1659 book Teutsche Algebra in which it appeared. This book by Rahn also contained what would become known as the \"Pell equation\".[14][15] Diophantine equations was a favourite subject with Pell; he lectured on them at Amsterdam. He is now best remembered, if perhaps erroneously, for the indeterminate equation/nwhich is known as Pell's equation. This problem was in fact proposed by Pierre de Fermat first to Bernard Fr\u00e9nicle de Bessy, and in 1657 to all mathematicians. Pell's connection with the problem is through Rahn. It consisted of publication of the solutions of John Wallis and Lord Brouncker in his edition of Thomas Branker's Translation of Rhonius's Algebra (1668); added to his earlier editorial contributions, whatever they were, to the 1659 algebra book written by Rahn (i.e. Rhonius).[16] This new edition by Pell of what was essentially Rahn's work included a great deal of additional material on number theory, amounting to a reply to the 1657 book Exercitationes mathematicae by Frans van Schooten. It is also notable for its inclusion of a Table of Incomposits, an early large factor table.[17]/nAfter his return to England, Pell took orders and in 1661 became rector of Fobbing in Essex. In 1663 he was given an honorary D. D. (Lambeth degree) and was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At the same time he was presented by Bishop Gilbert Sheldon to the rectory of Laindon, Essex; Sheldon expected him to treat the positions as sinecures.[10][18][19] He spent time visiting William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton, at Brereton Hall, having taught him mathematics at Breda, and after Brereton died in 1680 John Aubrey reported a very close friendship between the two men.[20]/nIn 1673 Pell met Leibniz in London, and was able to inform him that some of his mathematical work had been anticipated by Fran\u00e7ois Regnaud and Gabriel Mouton.[21][22] His devotion to mathematics seems to have interfered with his advancement in the Church and with his private life. For a time he was confined as a debtor in the King's Bench Prison. He lived, on the invitation of Dr Daniel Whistler, for a short time in 1682 at the College of Physicians, but died at the house of Mr Cothorne, reader of the church of St Giles-in-the Fields./nMany of Pell's manuscripts fell into the hands of Richard Busby, master of Westminster School, and afterwards came into the possession of the Royal Society; they are still preserved in nearly forty folio volumes in the British Library, which contain, not only Pell's own memoirs, but much of his correspondence with the mathematicians of his time./nHis chief works are:/nThe Idea was a short manifesto. It made three suggestions: a mathematical encyclopedia and bibliography; a complete mathematics research library and collection of instruments, with state sponsorship; and a three-volume comprehensive set of mathematical textbooks, able to convey the state of the art to any scholar.[23]/nJohn Pell's brother, Thomas Pell (1612/3\u20131669), was a physician who emigrated to New England in the 1630s. In 1654,[24] Thomas Pell signed a treaty with Chief Wampage and other Siwanoy Indian tribal members that granted him 50,000 acres (20,000\u00a0ha) of tribal land, including all or part of the Bronx and land to the west along Long Island Sound in what is now Westchester County, extending west to the Hutchinson River and north to Mamaroneck. Having no children, he left his estate to his nephew Sir John Pell (1643\u20131702), one of the mathematician's four sons, who travelled from England to New York and took up residence there as the first Lord of the Manor of Pelham. His descendants have continued to be prominent in American polity, including Ambassador and U.S. Representative Herbert Pell and U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell.

He introduced quasiconformal mappings and differential geometric methods into the study of Riemann surfaces. Teichm\u00fcller spaces are named after him./nBorn in Nordhausen, Teichm\u00fcller attended the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he graduated in 1935 under the supervision of Helmut Hasse. His doctoral dissertation was on operator theory, though this was his only work on functional analysis. His next few papers were algebraic, but he switched his focus to complex analysis after attending lectures given by Rolf Nevanlinna. In 1937, he moved to the University of Berlin to work with Ludwig Bieberbach. Bieberbach was the editor of Deutsche Mathematik and much of Teichm\u00fcller's work was published in the journal, which made his papers hard to find in modern libraries before the release of his collected works./nA member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and Sturmabteilung (SA), the military wing of the NSDAP, from 1931, Teichm\u00fcller agitated against his Jewish professors Richard Courant and Edmund Landau in 1933. He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in July 1939 and took part in the invasion of Norway in 1940 before being recalled to Berlin to undertake cryptographic work with the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht. In 1942, he was released from his military duties and returned to teach at the University of Berlin. After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, he gave up his position in Berlin to volunteer for combat on the Eastern Front. He was killed in action in September 1943./nSanford L. Segal, a professor of mathematics at the University of Rochester, in his 2003 book Mathematicians Under the Nazis said: \"Teichm\u00fcller was a gifted, brilliant, and seminal mathematician; he was also a dedicated Nazi.\"[1]/nPaul Julius Oswald Teichm\u00fcller was born in Nordhausen, and grew up in Sankt Andreasberg. His parents were Gertrude (n\u00e9e Dinse) and Adolf Julius Paul Teichm\u00fcller.[2] At the time of Oswald's birth, his father, a weaver, was 33 and his mother was 39; they had no further children.[3] His father was injured during World War I and died when Oswald was 12. According to Gertrude, when Oswald was three she discovered that he knew how to count and had learned to read on his own. After his father's death, she took him out of his school in Sankt Andreasberg which \"he had long outgrown\" and sent him to live with his aunt in Nordhausen, where he attended the Gymnasium.[4]/nTeichm\u00fcller received his Abitur in 1931, and enrolled at the University of G\u00f6ttingen as a \"brilliant but lonely student from the hinterlands.\"[4] Hans Lewy, a young instructor at G\u00f6ttingen at the time, later told anecdotes of the ungainly Teichm\u00fcller's brilliance.[5] Among Teichm\u00fcller's professors were Richard Courant, Gustav Herglotz, Edmund Landau, Otto Neugebauer and Hermann Weyl. He also joined the NSDAP in July 1931 and became a member of the Sturmabteilung in August 1931. On 2 November 1933 he organised the boycott of his Jewish professor Edmund Landau;[6] in 1994, Friedrich L. Bauer described Teichm\u00fcller as a \"genius\" but a \"fanatic Nazi\" who \"stood out with his agitation against Landau and Courant.\"[7] Teichm\u00fcller later met Landau in his office to discuss the boycott, and penned a letter, at Landau's request, regarding his motivation:/nI am not concerned with making difficulties for you as a Jew, but only with protecting \u2013 above all \u2013 German students of the second semester from being taught differential and integral calculus by a teacher of a race quite foreign to them. I, like everyone else, do not doubt your ability to instruct suitable students of whatever origin in the purely abstract aspects of mathematics. But I know that many academic courses, especially the differential and integral calculus, have at the same time educative value, inducting the pupil not only to a conceptual world but also to a different frame of mind. But since the latter depends very substantially on the racial composition of the individual, it follows that a German student should not be allowed to be trained by a Jewish teacher.[8]/nIn 1934, Teichm\u00fcller wrote a draft dissertation on operator theory, which he titled Operatoren im Wachsschen Raum.[9] The draft related to lectures he had received from Franz Rellich, but he did not bring his dissertation proposal to Rellich due to the fact Rellich was previously the assistant to the Jewish professor Richard Courant who fled Germany in 1933. Teichm\u00fcller instead brought it to Helmut Hasse. Operator theory was not in Hasse's area of expertise, so he sent it to Gottfried K\u00f6the. K\u00f6the's comments helped Teichm\u00fcller polish the dissertation, and Teichm\u00fcller submitted it for review on 10 June 1935 to his examining committee which consisted of Hasse, Herglotz and the G\u00f6ttingen physicist Robert Pohl. Teichm\u00fcller passed his doctoral exam on 28 June 1935 and was officially awarded his Ph.D in mathematics in November 1935.[10]/nAfter Teichm\u00fcller passed his doctoral exam in June 1935, Hasse petitioned for the university to appoint Teichm\u00fcller as an assistant professor in the mathematical department. In his letter he stated Teichm\u00fcller had \"extraordinary mathematical gifts\" and that his teaching style was \"painfully exact, in high degree suggestive, and impressive sort.\" Teichm\u00fcller received the position and began to devote himself more to mathematics at the expense of politics, which led fellow NSDAP members to describe him as \"eccentric\".[2]/nTeichm\u00fcller's doctoral dissertation was his only work on functional analysis, and his next few papers were algebraic, showing the influence Hasse had on him. In late 1936, he began to work on his habilitation thesis so that he could move to the University of Berlin to work with Ludwig Bieberbach, an outstanding mathematician, staunch supporter of the NSDAP and the editor of Deutsche Mathematik. Teichm\u00fcller's habilitation thesis, Untersuchungen \u00fcber konforme und quasikonforme Abbildungen, was not influenced by Hasse, but by the lectures of Rolf Nevanlinna, who was a visiting professor at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[11] Under the influence of Nevanlinna, Teichm\u00fcller moved away from algebra and developed an interest in complex analysis. He made four contributions to Deutsche Mathematik in 1936, three of them algebraic, but thereafter he published just one algebraic paper.[10]/nTeichm\u00fcller moved to Berlin in April 1937, and habilitated at the University of Berlin in March 1938. In Berlin with Bieberbach, Teichm\u00fcller had someone who shared his political views and who was also an exceptional mathematician, which led to two years of great productivity. Between April 1937 and July 1939, Teichm\u00fcller published seven papers in addition to his 197-page monograph on \"extremal quasiconformal mappings and quadratic differentials,\" which laid the basis for the theory of the Teichm\u00fcller space.[12]/nOn 18 July 1939, Teichm\u00fcller was drafted into the Wehrmacht. He was originally intended to do only eight weeks' training but World War II broke out before the eight weeks were up so he remained in the army and took part in Operation Weser\u00fcbung in April 1940. Afterwards, he was recalled to Berlin where he became involved in cryptographic work along with other mathematicians such as Ernst Witt, Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner and Wolfgang Franz in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht.[13]/nIn 1941, Bieberbach requested that Teichm\u00fcller be released from his military duties in order to continue teaching at the University of Berlin. This request was granted and he was able to teach at the university from 1942 to early 1943.[2] After the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, however, Teichm\u00fcller left his position in Berlin and volunteered for combat on the Eastern Front, entering a unit which became involved in the Battle of Kursk. In the beginning of August, he received furlough when his unit reached Kharkiv. His unit was surrounded by Soviet troops and largely wiped out by late August, but in early September he attempted to rejoin them. He is reported to have reached somewhere east of the Dnieper but west of Kharkiv (most likely Poltava), where he was killed in action on 11 September 1943.[1]/nIn his career, Teichm\u00fcller wrote 34 papers in the space of around 6 years. His early algebraic investigations dealt with the valuation theory of fields and the structure of algebras. In valuation theory, he introduced multiplicative systems of representatives of the residue field of valuation rings, which led to a characterisation of the structure of the whole field in terms of the residue field. In the theory of algebras, he started to generalise Emmy Noether's concept of crossed products from fields to certain kind of algebras, gaining new insights into the structure of p-algebras. Although from 1937 on his main interests shifted to geometric function theory, Teichm\u00fcller did not give up algebra; in a paper published in 1940, he explored further steps toward a Galois theory of algebras, resulting in the introduction of a group that was later recognised as a third Galois cohomology group./nAfter his habilitation in 1938, Teichm\u00fcller turned to questions in the variation of conformal structures on surfaces, raised earlier by Bernhard Riemann, Henri Poincar\u00e9, Felix Klein, and Robert Fricke. His most important innovation was the introduction of quasiconformal mappings to the field, using ideas first developed by Herbert Gr\u00f6tzsch and Lars Ahlfors in different contexts. Teichm\u00fcller's main conjecture stated that variation of conformal structure can be realised uniquely by extremal quasiconformal mappings. Teichm\u00fcller also established a connection between extremal quasiconformal mappings and regular quadratic differentials using a class of related reciprocal Beltrami differentials, which led him to another conjecture proclaiming the existence of a bicontinuous bijective correspondence \u03a6 between a space T1, of real parts of certain reciprocal Beltrami differentials and Mg, n the moduli space of all conformal structures considered. In fact, he proved the existence and injectivity of \u03a6./nTeichm\u00fcller also showed the existence of extremal quasiconformal mappings in the special case of certain simply connected plane regions. He then gave an existence proof for surface of type (g, 0) by a continuity argument from the uniformisation theorem and Finsler metrics. This was also intended as a first step toward a deeper investigation of moduli spaces; in one of his last papers he sketched an idea of how to endow moduli spaces with an analytic structure and how to construct an analytic fiber space of Riemann surfaces. Due to his early death, Teichm\u00fcller could not fully work out most of his ideas. However, they became seminal for later work by other mathematicians.[14]/nIn 1984, Swiss mathematician Kurt Strebel gave an overview of Lars Ahlfors and Frederick Gehring's 1982 work Oswald Teichm\u00fcller: Gesammelte Abhandlungen:/nIn 1936 Teichm\u00fcller published five papers about various algebraic topics, and three more in 1937. But it was already in that same year that two papers in function theory appeared, one on value distribution and the other on the type problem, using quasiconformal mappings. He was already an expert in the Nevanlinna theory and evidently greatly influenced by Ahlfors' contributions to it./nTeichm\u00fcller's habilitation thesis: Untersuchungen \u00fcber konforme und quasikonforme Abbildungen (\"Studies of conformal and quasiconformal mappings\"), which appeared in 1938, and the next paper: Ungleichungen zwischen den Koeffizienten schlichter Funktionen (\"Inequalities between the coefficients of simple functions\") can be considered as the beginning of his great contributions to function theory, which culminated in his masterpiece: Extremale quasikonforme Abbildungen und quadratische Differentiale (\"Extremal quasiconformal mappings and quadratic differentials\")\n(1939). In this monograph and its complement: Bestimmung der extremalen quasikonformen Abbildungen bei geschlossenen orientierten Riemannschen Fl\u00e4chen (\"Determination of extremal quasiconformal mappings with closed oriented Riemann surfaces\") (1943), Teichm\u00fcller laid the basis of what is now known as the theory of Teichm\u00fcller spaces. He further developed the theme in one of his last papers: Ver\u00e4nderliche Riemannsche Fl\u00e4chen (\"Variable Riemann surfaces\") (1944)./nThere are other things, like the extremal mappings of the pentagon (1941) or the Verschiebungssatz (\"The displacement law\") where he shows with great mastery how to deal with special problems. Some other papers on pure function theory, like Eine Versch\u00e4rfung des Dreikreisesatzes (\"A tightening of the three circles theorem\"), and on algebraic functions, round out the picture.[15]/nFrom 2007 to 2020, the European Mathematical Society published seven volumes of the Handbook of Teichm\u00fcller Theory.

His recent results include obtaining a \n\n\n\n3\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3}\n\n approximation algorithm for the capacitated facility location problem. The joint work with Fabian Chudak,[4] has resulted in improving the previous known \n\n\n\n5.69\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 5.69}\n\n approximation for the same problem. Their algorithm is based on a variant of randomized rounding called the randomized rounding with a backup, since a backup solution is incorporated to correct for the fact that the ordinary randomized rounding rarely generates a feasible solution to the associated set covering problem./nFor the incapacitated version of the facility location problem, again in a joint work with Chudak[5] he obtained a \n\n\n\n(\n1\n+\n2\n\n/\n\ne\n)\n\u2248\n1.736\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (1+2/e)\\approx 1.736}\n\n-approximation algorithm which was a significant improvement on the previously known approximation guarantees.\nThe improved algorithm works by rounding an optimal fractional solution of a linear programming relaxation and using the properties of the optimal solutions of the linear program and a generalization of a decomposition technique./nDavid Shmoys is an ACM Fellow, a SIAM Fellow, and a Fellow of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) (2013).

He is also known as a participant in urban protection and environmental actions (including the protection of historical buildings and green areas from construction business) in the Ramenka district, where the main complex of MSU is located.[5] Like a number of other representatives of the scientific and pedagogical community, he criticized and protested against the Law on Educational Activities.[6]/nFor his public activities, he was under pressure from the administration and twice, in 2013 and 2018, he was subjected to attempts to dismiss from the university, but thanks to the solidarity campaign, he was reinstated as a teacher of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of MSU.[7][8]/nLobanov himself supported political prisoners, including fellow mathematicians Dmitry Bogatov[9] and Azat Miftakhov,[10] as well as members of the editorial board of the student magazine \"DOXA\".[11]/nIn the municipal elections in Moscow in 2022, he supported such candidates as Konstantin Konkov, Arseniy Lytar, Denis Zhilin, Vladlena Mokrousova, Nikita Kozlov.[12]/nOn 23 June 2023, he was declared a foreign agent by the Russian government, and in July of the same year, he was fired from his post as docent of mechanics and mathematics at the Moscow State University. He announced that he was planning to leave Russia, and .[13]/nIn 2021 Lobanov was nominated by Communist Party of the Russian Federation (despite the fact that he is not a member of the party) and received the support from Smart Voting as a candidate for the State Duma of the Russian Federation in the 197th Kuntsevo single-mandate constituency. His main competitor was the candidate from the Moscow mayor's office, the TV presenter Yevgeny Popov, who was nominated by United Russia party and endorsed by Mayor Sergey Sobyanin./nAccording to the results of voting in precincts, Lobanov comfortably led by a margin of more than 10 thousand votes,[14] however, after the publication of the results of remote electronic voting (DEG), it turned out that he lost to Popov.[15][16] According to official data, he received 72,805 votes (31.65%) - the best indicator among all opposition candidates in Moscow districts./nMikhail Lobanov did not recognize the results of the elections, urging other opposition candidates to join the fight for annulment of the results. Lobanov took part in the CPRF rally on Pushkinskaya Square on the night of September 20.[17] Lobanov organized a meeting with State Duma member Denis Parfyonov in Ramenki on September 23 in order to promote cancellation of the results of remote electronic voting (DEG).[18]/nOn September 23 police visited Lobanov on the eve of the September 25 rally,[19] as well as other protest leaders.[20]/nIn terms of political views, he defines himself as a democratic socialist; among ideologically close foreign politicians, he names United States Senator Bernie Sanders and former leader of the British Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn.[21] The key points of his electoral program in 2021, using the leitmotif of \"fighting blatant economic and political inequality,\" were raising the minimum wage, increasing the progressive scale of taxation, increasing spending on education and science, canceling pension reform and lowering the retirement age, and protecting the environment. Lobanov's campaign was supported by independent trade unions (Confederation of Labour of Russia[22]) and a number of left-wing organizations (Russian Socialist Movement, Marxist Tendency,[23] Union of Democratic Socialists[24] and others)./nMikhail Lobanov opposes Russian invasion to Ukraine. On 7 June 2022 he was arrested by the police for anti-war banner \u00abNo War\u00bb.[25] In 24 June 2022, he was detained for fifteen days by Russian police and fined 40 000 rubles for having made statements on social media opposing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[26]", "20250709": "Anatoly Alexeyevich Karatsuba (his first name often spelled Anatolii) (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0301\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0443\u0301\u0431\u0430; Grozny, Soviet Union, 31 January 1937 \u2013 Moscow, Russia, 28 September 2008[1]) was a Russian mathematician working in the field of analytic number theory, p-adic numbers and Dirichlet series./nFor most of his student and professional life he was associated with the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, defending a D.Sc. there entitled \"The method of trigonometric sums and intermediate value theorems\" in 1966.[2] He later held a position at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences.[2]/nHis textbook Foundations of Analytic Number Theory went to two editions, 1975 and 1983.[2]/nThe Karatsuba algorithm is the earliest known divide and conquer algorithm for multiplication and lives on as a special case of its direct generalization, the Toom\u2013Cook algorithm.[3]/nThe main research works of Anatoly Karatsuba were published in more than 160 research papers and monographs.[4]/nHis daughter, Yekaterina Karatsuba, also a mathematician, constructed the FEE method./nAs a student of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Karatsuba attended the seminar of Andrey Kolmogorov and found solutions to two problems set up by Kolmogorov.

Artin initially conjectured a result, which would now be described as the p-adic field being a C2 field; in other words non-trivial representation of zero would occur if the number of variables was at least d2. This was shown not to be the case by an example of Guy Terjanian. Karatsuba showed that, in order to have a non-trivial representation of zero by a form, the number of variables should grow faster than polynomially in the degree d; this number in fact should have an almost exponential growth, depending on the degree.

He may be best known for his work in the field that would eventually be called Additive Combinatorics. Particularly notable was his \"ingenious\"[2] application of the Szemer\u00e9di\u2013Trotter theorem to improve the best known lower bound for the sum-product problem.[3] He also proved that any polynomial-time algorithm approximating the volume of convex bodies must have a multiplicative error, and the error grows exponentially on the dimension.[4] With Micha Sharir he set up a framework which eventually led Guth and Katz to the solution of the Erd\u0151s distinct distances problem.[5] (See below.)/nAfter graduating from the mathematics program at Fazekas Mih\u00e1ly Gimn\u00e1zium (i.e., \"Fazekas Mih\u00e1ly high school\" in Budapest, which is known for its excellence, especially in mathematics), Elekes studied mathematics at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University.

He received the Doctor of Mathematical Sciences title from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2001.[1]/nElekes started his mathematical work in combinatorial set theory, answering some questions posed by Erd\u0151s and Hajnal. One of his results states that if the set of infinite subsets of the set of natural numbers is split into countably many parts, then in one of them, there is a solution of the equation A\u222aB=C.[1][6] His interest later switched to another favorite topic of Erd\u0151s, discrete geometry and geometric algorithm theory. In 1986 he proved that if a deterministic polynomial algorithm computes a number V(K) for every convex body K in any Euclidean space given by a separation oracle such that V(K) always at least vol(K), the volume of K, then for every large enough dimension n, there is a convex body in the n-dimensional Euclidean space such that V(K)>20.99nvol(K). That is, any polynomial-time estimator of volume over K must be inaccurate by at least an exponential factor.[1][4]/nNot long before his death he developed new tools in Algebraic geometry and used them to obtain results in Discrete geometry, proving Purdy's Conjecture. Micha Sharir organized, extended and published Elekes's posthumous notes on these methods.[7] Then Nets Katz and Larry Guth used them to solve (apart from a factor of (log n) 1/2 ) the Erd\u0151s distinct distances problem, posed in 1946.[5]", "64782432": "D.

Francisca Em\u00edlia Pereira da Silva from Ponta Delgada; on his father's side, he was the grandson of Tom\u00e1s Ant\u00f3nio da Guarda Cabreira (1792\u20131834), a field marshal in the Miguelist army during the Portuguese Civil War, who had been granted the titles of Count of Lagos and Viscount of Vale da Mata by the Miguelist faction. Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira was the younger brother of Colonel Tom\u00e1s Cabreira (1865\u20131918), a Republican politician who taught Chemistry at the Lisbon Polytechnic School and who briefly occupied the office of Minister of Finance in 1914.[citation needed]/nAnt\u00f3nio Cabreira was baptized at the Church of Saint Mary of the Castle, on 17 February 1869.[1] As a child, Cabreira was taught by Fr. Francisco de Paula da Fonseca Neves, parish priest of Lumiar in Lisbon, but abandoned his studies at age 12 to accompany his father while he served as a lieutenant colonel in Porto and in Lagos. In 1885, at age 17, he enrolled in the National Lyceum of Faro, and from 1887 to 1889, went to study in Lisbon.[2] At age 21, after a medical committee turned him down as physically unfit for a military career like that of his father and grandfather, he started attending the marine engineering course at the Lisbon Polytechnic School: it was around this time that he became engaged in politics (a fact that once again forced him to interrupt his studies), having joined the Legitimist Party.[2] He quickly rose though the ranks and filled several positions in the party leadership, having successfully brought student grievances to public attention and lobbied for student welfare.[3] In 1891, Cabreira became the Political Editor of the periodical A Na\u00e7\u00e3o, the official organ of the Legitimist Party.[2]/nIn 1894, Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira established the Instituto Dezanove de Setembro (Nineteenth of September Institute; the birthday of Miguel, Duke of Braganza[4]), which provided primary and secondary education courses. Cabreira was at first occupied with the management of the institution; in 1899, he began teaching Rational Mechanics and Philosophy of Mathematics to the Institute's Science students.[5]/nIn the wake of the generalised nationalist sentiment brought about after the 1890 British Ultimatum, Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira became active in the Lisbon Geographic Society, vigorously promoting Portuguese colonialism.[5]/nIn the 1890s, Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira started publishing his numerous monographs that brought to light his mathematical discoveries and his novel viewpoints on philosophy and sociology: among these first works are An\u00e1lise Geom\u00e9trica de Duas Espirais Parab\u00f3licas (\"Geometric Analysis of Two Parabolic Spirals\", 1895), Sobre as Propriedades Geom\u00e9tricas da Espiral de Poinsot (\"On the Geometric Properties of Poinsot's Spiral\", 1896), Descoberta e Primeiras Propriedades Geom\u00e9tricas de uma Espiral Bin\u00f3mia do Primeiro Grau (\"Discovery and First Geometric Properties of a Binomial Spiral of the First Degree\", 1897). In 1896, the Geographic Society publicly lauded his first works as \"scientific successes\".[3] On 18 March 1897, he was simultaneous and unanimously elected a fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences and a foreign associate of the Academy of Sciences, Inscriptions, and Fine Arts of Toulouse. He later became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences and Letters of Montpellier (29 March 1898), of the Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Fine Arts of Dijon (3 March 1897), of the Academy of Political and Social Sciences of Venezuela (7 March  1922), a corresponding academic of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona (31 March 1909), and a corresponding academic of the International Academy of Letters and Sciences of Naples (6 April 1921).[2]/nHe was awarded a honorary doctorate in Mathematics by the University of Arizona on 18 June 1912, and was bestowed with the University of Amsterdam's Medal of Honour on 23 December 1933, on the occasion of its tricentennial.[2]/nIn 1907, Ant\u00f3nio Cabreira founded the Academy of Sciences of Portugal, as a competing institution to the old Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences. The new, short-lived Academy (dissolved in 1925), was a reflection of Cabreira's partisanship of absolutism and his loathing for the declining liberal monarchy and its institutions; the new Academy attracted valuable support from leading figures of the republican movement \u2014 unlikely allies but also oppositionists to the regime \u2014 chief among them prominent politicians (and later Presidents of the Republic) Te\u00f3filo Braga, Bernardino Machado, and Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida.[6] After the 1910 Revolution, the Republican authorities were quick to approve the statutes of the new Academy in an attempt to legitimise it into an official academy of the regime, but in due course, and especially after Braga's death in 1924, it started to lose its relative importance and fading into obscurity[7] as the old Lisbon Academy was gradually assimilated into the new regime./nNevertheless, the Academy was successively enlarged by the creation of \"Annexed Institutes\", with the intention of disseminating the Academy's \"patriotic and educational work\" throughout the Portuguese World.[8] These included:/nAnt\u00f3nio Cabreira was also responsible for the First Colonial Congress in 1900, and the First National Pedagogical Congress in 1908.[5] In 1920, Cabreira hosted the First National Archaeological Congress (Congresso Arqueol\u00f3gico Nacional),[5] held in Tavira. Even though it was sparsely attended by the Portuguese archaeologists, the Congress was notable for defending the principle of archaeological exploration across the country and the safeguarding and promotion of archaeological heritage, and for criticising the established practices of the National Archaeology Museum.[9]/nAntonio Cabreira had an inflated sense of his own academic importance and of the significance of his work. Due to his prolific published monographs on a vast array of different areas of knowledge, he soon created a public image of great intellectual dynamism and exaggerated cultural protagonism. This was heightened by his frequent self-congratulatory publications and speeches, particularly one delivered to the Lisbon Academy of Sciences in 1922 and published under the title Discurso Comemorativo das suas Bodas de Prata Acad\u00e9micas e Ep\u00edtome dos Trabalhos Apresentados na Academia das Ci\u00eancias de Lisboa (\"Commemorative Speech of His Academic Silver Jubilee and the Epitome of his Work Presented before the Lisbon Academy of Sciences\").[10]/nHis numerous published monographs frequently featured a title page framed by a sprawling full list of his honorary distinctions, mentioning each of his many memberships in national and international learned societies and were accompanied by fanciful photographic portraits of Cabreira in elaborate academic garb, decked in collars and decorations.[7]/nThis recurring posture inspired harsh criticism from some figures of the Portuguese cultural and academic scene, such as physician and politician Augusto de Vasconcelos, and the priest, theologian and Cam\u00f5es scholar Jos\u00e9 Maria Rodrigues. Rodolfo Guimar\u00e3es denounced the quality of Cabreira's work in the field of mathematics and did not go without answer: Cabreira refuted every last of Guimar\u00e3es's objections in two separate monographs (Quelques mots sur les math\u00e9matiques en Portugal, 1905; and Les Math\u00e9matiques en Portugal, 1910) \u2014 in which he defended his own mathematical work as \"original and important\".[10] Rather telling is Cabreira's response to the French Academy of Sciences's refusal to publish one of his papers, by arguing that its reception being registered in the Academy's comptes-rendus was in itself proof of its scientific merit:/n\"Le fait de la Note \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e dans les Comptes Rendus d\u00e9montre d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'existence de quelque valeur, puisque ni tous les travaux adress\u00e9s \u00e0 l'Acad\u00e9mie sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en sc\u00e9ance.

Francisca Em\u00edlia Cabreira, as well as those of his brother, Colonel Tom\u00e1s Cabreira. The imposing funerary monument is decorated with the arms attributed to the Counts of Lagos, and architectural motifs of lions, armillary spheres, and the crosses of the Military Order of Aviz and of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword.

In 1942, Cabreira donated the house in which he was born (located on a street that currently bears his name) to the local City Council, as a suitable place to hold the Municipal Archive; it serves that purpose to this day. His personal archive, as well as the furniture in his personal study, was left to the Lisbon Geographic Society.[12]/nAnt\u00f3nio Cabreira was the main founder and promoter of the Order of Saint Mary of the Castle (Ordem de Santa Maria do Castelo), established on 20 December 1921, a confraternal order with the stated goals of exalting the memory of Paio Peres Correia, the knight of the Reconquista who was responsible for the military campaign that saw the fortified city of Tavira reconquered from the Almohad Caliphate in 1242, and preserving the Church of Saint Mary of the Castle, the town's mother church.

His work, which involved the development of numerical models to simulate the intricate interactions among aerosols, clouds, and radiation, has enhanced the understanding of the role of stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols in shaping regional and global climate, including their influence on temperature, atmospheric and ocean circulation, and extreme weather events. Among several awards, he received the Highlight Award from the American Geophysical Union for his research publication titled \"The Impact of Aerosols on simulated ocean temperature and heat content in the 20th Century\".[9]/nFollowing his early studies of the climate impact of smoke from urban fires ignited by nuclear explosions, Stenchikov's research has focused on understanding the impacts of volcanic explosions on climate. A volcanic cloud in the aftermath of a strong explosive volcanic eruption could cover the entire Earth for several years, reflecting solar radiation and causing a long-lasting cooling effect.[10] Since 1850, volcanic eruptions have offset about 30% of ocean heat uptake forced by greenhouse gas warming.[11] He found that along with global cooling, volcanic impacts can cause large-scale changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, forcing the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, accelerating Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, increasing the polar sea-ice extent[12] and prolonging El Ninos.[13][14] Despite the global nature of volcanic forcing, the climate responses have pronounced regional signatures, such as winter warming in Siberia and freezing winters in the Middle East.[15] He conducted new simulations of the Toba super-eruption, a particularly devastating event that occurred in Sumatra around 75,000 years ago and emitted in the atmosphere about 2 billion tons of sulfur dioxide.[16][17][18] He modified a regional atmospheric chemistry model, WRF-Chem, to capture the initial stage of the volcanic cloud formed after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. The simulations showed that in the first week after the eruption, the volcanic cloud rose into the stratosphere at a rate of 1\u00a0km/day, driven initially by ash's solar absorption and later by sulfate aerosol absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation. This profoundly affected the long-term evolution and radiative impact of the volcanic cloud.[18]/nTo study climate change and variability, Stenchikov has calculated the future climate projections employing the global high-resolution atmospheric model (HiRAM) with a spatial resolution of 25x25 km2 and performed climate downscaling using nested regional model WRF-Chem with fine grid spacing down to 3\u00a0km.[19][20] To add to physical consistency in modeling the Middle East climate, he coupled the regional atmospheric model (WRF-Chem) with the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS), accounting for aerosol and atmospheric chemistry processes, and conducted the first coupled regional simulations of the impact of tropospheric dust and stratospheric volcanic aerosols on the Middle East and the Red Sea.[21] His research highlighted that a combination of coupled atmospheric and oceanic simulations and ground-based aerosol measurements[22][23][24] are the best tools for informing governments when they have to make critical decisions regarding air quality and climate change. His recent research suggested that forestation of the Red Sea Arabian coastal plain was unlikely to increase precipitation in the breezes zone. However, decreasing land-surface albedo by deploying solar panels could potentially generate 1.5 Gt of rainwater annually to meet the needs of 5 million people.[24]/nIn desert regions like the Middle East, dust profoundly impacts the environment, climate, air quality, and human health. In addition, dust affects the efficiency of solar energy devices by reducing the downward solar flux and settling on their optically active surfaces. Stenchikov demonstrated that the desert climate is extremely sensitive to radiative forcing,[25] the change in Earth's energy balance associated with greenhouse gas emissions, desertification, urbanization, and shrinking vegetation cover. This effect is influenced by an abundance of particulates, including sand, dust, and anthropogenic pollutants, suspended in the air, collectively named aerosols.[26][27] The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) contribute to over half of global dust emissions,[28] and dust significantly influences the regional radiative balance and atmospheric circulation.[29][30][31] The prolonged drought and social conflicts led to the growth of dust aerosol optical depth, which characterizes the radiative effect of aerosols.[32] Over the past three decades, observations and computer simulations have shown that the Arabian Peninsula's average temperature has been increasing by about 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C per decade, exceeding almost twice the trend observed in the northern hemisphere.[33] The analysis shows that atmospheric heating in the middle troposphere caused by Saharan dust alters Hadley and Walker circulation, moving the rain belt north in the summer and increasing precipitation in the Sahel.[34] He highlighted that the radiative surface cooling of the Southern Red Sea due to accumulated dust layers reaches 40 W/m2, affecting the circulation and energy balance of the sea - an effect that had not been previously recognized.[35] In recent research, he stated that the natural and anthropogenic aerosol mix could severely affect air quality.[36] The interaction between dust and anthropogenic aerosols alters the aerosol's optical properties, radiative forcing, and their interaction with clouds.[37][38] The direct radiative forcing from aerosols diminishes the pace of regional warming, but its future projections are largely unknown.[27]", "24641679": "Robin Thomas (August 22, 1962 \u2013 March 26, 2020) was a mathematician working in graph theory at the Georgia Institute of Technology./nThomas received his doctorate in 1985 from Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic), under the supervision of Jaroslav Ne\u0161et\u0159il.[3] He joined the faculty at Georgia Tech in 1989, and became a Regents' Professor there,[4][5]\nbriefly serving as the department Chair./nOn March 26, 2020, he died of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis at the age of 57 after 12 years of struggle with the illness.[2][6]/nThomas was awarded the Fulkerson Prize for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics twice,[7] in 1994 as co-author of a paper on the Hadwiger conjecture,[8] and in 2009 for the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem.[9]\nIn 2011 he was awarded the Karel Jane\u010dek Foundation Neuron Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Mathematics.[10] In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.[11]\nHe was named a SIAM Fellow in 2018.[12]  The January 2023 issue of the Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B was a tribute to his work.[13]/nThis article about an American mathematician is a stub.

The first is a very general Lusin type theorem for gradients asserting that every Borel vector field can be realized as the gradient of a continuously differentiable function outside a closed subset of a priori prescribed (small) measure.[1] The second asserts the rank-one property of the distributional derivatives of functions with bounded variation, thereby verifying a conjecture of De Giorgi.[2] This theorem has found several applications, as for instance in the Ambrosio's proof of an open problem posed by Di Perna and Lions concerning the well-posedness of the continuity equation involving BV vector fields.[3] This result is nowadays commonly known as Alberti's rank-one theorem and its proof rests of a very delicate use of sophisticated tools from geometric measure theory; in particular, it makes use of the concept of tangent measure to another measure.[4][5] Subsequently, Alberti has given contributions to the study of various aspects of Ginzburg-Landau vortices and of the continuity equation.[6]/nAlberti has been awarded the Caccioppoli prize in 2002 and has been an invited speaker at the fourth European Congress of Mathematics.", "27689116": "Huzihiro Araki (\u8352\u6728 \u4e0d\u4e8c\u6d0b, Araki Fujihiro, 28 July 1932[1] \u2013 16 December 2022[2]) was a Japanese mathematical physicist and mathematician who worked on the foundations of quantum field theory, on quantum statistical mechanics, and on the theory of operator algebras.[3]/nAraki is the son of the University of Kyoto physics professor Gentar\u014d Araki, with whom he studied and with whom in 1954 he published his first physics paper.

He also supplied important contributions in the mathematical theory of operator algebras, classifying the type-III factors of von Neumann algebras.[5] Araki originated the concept of relative entropy of states of von Neumann algebras. In the 1970s he showed the equivalence in quantum thermodynamics of, on the one hand, the KMS condition (named after Ryogo Kubo, Paul C. Martin, and Julian Schwinger) for the characterization of quantum mechanical states in thermodynamic equilibrium with, on the other hand, the variational principle for quantum mechanical spin systems on lattices.[6] With Yanase he worked on the foundations of quantum mechanics, i.e. the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which describes restrictions that conservation laws impose upon the physical measuring process.[7] Stated in more precise terms, they proved that an exact measurement of an operator, which additively replaces the operator with a conserved size, is impossible.

He was known for his contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, part of a group that included Lorentz, Einstein, Minkowski, Thomson, Rutherford, Sommerfeld, R\u00f6ntgen, von Laue, Bohr, de Broglie, Ehrenfest and Schwarzschild./nPaul Epstein's parents, Siegmund Simon Epstein and Sarah Sophia (Lurie) Epstein were of a middle class Jewish family. He said that his mother recognized his potential at the age of four years and predicted that he would be a mathematician. He went to the Hochschule in Minsk, and from 1901 to 1905 studied mathematics and physics at the Imperial University of Moscow under Pyotr Nikolaevich Lebedev. In 1909 he graduated, and became a Privatdozent at the University of Moscow. In 1910 he went to Munich, Germany, to do research under Arnold Sommerfeld, who was his advisor, and Epstein was granted a Ph.D. on a problem in the theory of diffraction of electromagnetic waves.[1] from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, in 1914.[2] At the outbreak of World War I he was in Munich, and considered an \"enemy alien\". Thanks to Sommerfeld's intervention he was allowed to stay in Munich as a private citizen, and could continue with his research. By that time Epstein became interested in the quantum theory of atomic structure. In 1916, he published a seminal paper explaining the Stark effect using the Bohr Sommerfeld (\"old\") quantum theory.[3]\nAfter the war he went to Zurich, where he remained for two years. He moved to Leiden in 1921, to become Hendrik Lorentz' and Paul Ehrenfest's assistant. Shortly afterwards he was recruited by Robert Millikan to come to the California Institute of Technology, where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1922 he published 3 papers on Bohr's quantum mechanics in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik and one in the Physical Review. In 1926 he published the paper \"The Stark Effect from the Point of View of Schrodinger's Quantum Theory\" in the Physical Review, as well as \"The New Quantum Theory and the Zeeman Effect\" (1926), and \"The Magnetic Dipole in Undulatory Mechanics\" (1927)./nIn 1920 Epstein calculated the effect of Polflucht as a possible causing force of Wegener's continental drift. His value was about 10^-6 of the gravitational force. Some years later other geophysicists could show that the Polflucht force is far too weak to cause plate tectonics. The toughness of the sublayers of the Earth's crust is much more stronger than assumed by Epstein./nIn 1924, Epstein calculated the drag on a sphere moving in a gas in the rarefied (i.e., high, or at least not small, Knudsen number) flow regime (Epstein, Phys. Rev., 23, 710 (1924)). This calculation was an important ingredient in improved measurements of the charge of the\nelectron in the Millikan oil drop experiment, as cited and described as \"masterly\" by Millikan himself in his review paper of 1930 (Millikan, Phys. Rev., 35, 1231 (1930)). Epstein's important result is now known as Epstein drag in honor of his work./nIn 1930 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

After World War II, concerned that some young American intellectuals were becoming attracted to communism, he joined the American Committee for Cultural Freedom and in 1951 he served as one of the three US delegates to the seminar the Congress held in Strasbourg./nAs well as quantum theory, Epstein also published papers in other fields. Examples include \"\"Zur Theorie des Radiometers\" (1929), \"Reflection of Waves in an Inhomogeneous Absorbing Medium\" (1930) and \"On the Air Resistance of Projectiles\" (1931). Other subjects that he worked on were the settling of gases in the atmosphere, the theory of vibrations of shells and plates and the absorption of sound in fogs and suspensions.

His early research dealt with functional analysis, potential theory, integral equations, and mathematical economics./nIn 1934, he moved to University of California, Berkeley to chair the mathematics department.[5] Here, Evans was tasked with improving the department, including the initiation of a graduate program. Much of his success was due to his ability to recruit many notable research mathematicians, including Hans Lewy, Jerzy Neyman, and Alfred Tarski.[1] His own research work was in potential theory and mathematics applied to economics. He chaired Berkeley's department until 1949 and retired in 1955,[5] eventually becoming the namesake of Evans Hall at Berkeley./nEvans first work in mathematical economics, entitled A Simple Theory of Competition[6] a restatement of Augustine Cournot's monopoly/duopoly model. Evans expanded Cournot's work in significantly by exploring the analytical implications of a variety of different assumptions as to the behavior and objectives of either the monopolist or the duopolists. His following work, The Dynamics of Monopoly,[7] published in 1924, was one of the first to apply the calculus of variations to economic theory. He frames the same monopolist problem now in an intertemporal framework, that is, instead of seeking immediate profit-maximization, the monopolist aims to make his profits as maximum through an interval of time. His work was followed by his Ph.D. advisee Charles Roos who generalized his monopoly model to a case with multiple competing firms. Roos also managed to express this model within a general equilibrium framework.[8] Roos would also be one of the three founders of the Econometric Society alongside Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch and American economist Irving Fisher. Evans participated in the foundation of the Society and became one of its first fellows./nThe first economist to take notice of Evans' work was Harold Hotelling. He met personally with Evans at a meeting of the American Mathematical Society and was immediately impressed by the scope of his work which he deemed to be a \"dawning economic theory\" that would bear \"to the older theories the relations which the Hamiltonian dynamics and the thermodynamics of entropy bear to their predecessors\".[9] At this time, economics was not seen as a mathematical science, and many economists were even doubtful if mathematics could be useful for social sciences in general. As a result, Evans and Roos found only a small audience properly equipped to understand their works. Even so, the more mathematically inclined economists and mathematicians E. B. Wilson, Irving Fisher, Henry Schultz, and Paul Samuelson[10] all recognized the importance of their theory./nEvans main contribution to mathematical economics came in the form of his 1930 textbook Mathematical Introduction to Economics,[11] published by Mc Graw Hill. The book's reception, however, failed to meet Evans' expectations.[3] British economist Arthur L. Bowley, in particular, was very critical stating that the book would be of no use either to the mathematician nor to the economist.[12] R. G. D. Allen, a colleague of Bowley, also criticized the book for not presenting a general economic theory and focusing too much on the resolution of particular problems.[13] Some positive reviews came from Roos and Hotelling, the latter going as far as saying that the book helped \"lay a groundwork upon which future contributions to political economy of first-rate importance may be expected to be based\".[14]/nDespite the mixed reception of his textbook, Evans continued interested in mathematical economics throughout his lifetime. In 1934 he contributed Maximum Production Studied in a Simplified Economic System[15] to the recently established journal Econometrica, published on behalf of the Econometric Society. This work would later be extended by some of his students at Berkeley.[16] He also maintained contact with the field attending seminars and presenting papers at meetings organized by the Econometric Society[17] and the Cowles Commission for Economic Research.[18]/nDuring his time at Berkeley Evans arranged a weekly seminar on mathematical economics at his home. He also supervised many Ph.D. theses in the field that followed similar lines of his work. One of his most notable students was economist Ronald Shephard, famous for his derivation of Shephard's lemma. Shephard's 1953 Cost and Production Functions expands Evans' theoretical work on costs functions.[19] He also restates Evans' classical dynamic monopoly problem, better incorporating expectations and price changes.[19] Other notable students include Francis W. Dresch, Kenneth May, and Edward A. Davis./nSome authors, such as Roy Weintraub, argue that Evans' impact in mathematical economics was severely limited by his refusal to adopt utility in his economic models.[3] The subjective theory of value stated the individuals aimed to make their pleasure or utility a maximum. Evans argued that the mathematical conditions to assure the existence of an index function such as utility were stiff and artificial. Moreover, he stated that ''[t]here is no such measurable quantity as 'value' or 'utility' (with all due respect to Jevons, Walras and others) and there is no evaluation of 'the greatest happiness for the greatest number'; or, more flatly,\u2013 there is no such thing''.[20] His 1930 book featured two chapters where he criticized utility from the standpoint of the integrability conditions necessary to guarantee that a demand function be the result of the maximization of some utility function.[21] Despite being criticized by many other authors, utility remained a central concept for economics. Additionally, from the 1940s through the 1960s, Keynesianism dominated the macrodynamics discussion. Samuelson's Foundations of Economic Analysis formalized dynamics as the study of the limiting properties of systems of differential equations. In this sense, the analysis was now confined to the stability and convergence of these systems around a steady state. How the system responded to shocks was deemed more relevant than understanding any particular point of equilibrium./nGeneral interest in the calculus of variations an intertemporal optimization rekindled with the rise the neoclassical growth literature (e.g. Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans model) that ostensibly employed optimal control and Hamiltonians. Standard textbooks in economics now commonly present some stylized version of Evans' monopoly problem.[22]", "6095048": "Thomas James Willmore (16 April 1919 \u2013 20 February 2005) was an English geometer.

In 1700 a tutor taught him algebra and geometry, and in 1702 he attended Attercliffe Academy, near Sheffield, for logic and metaphysics.[4] He was introduced to Cambridge via meetings with the local gentry at Underbank Hall, near Penistone./nIn 1707, he arrived in Cambridge with his friend Joshua Dunn from Attercliffe Academy,[4] a fellow-commoner at Christ's College. During this time, he resided in Christ's and could make use of the library but was not admitted to the university.[5] He wanted to teach and with the permission of the Lucasian professor, William Whiston, Saunderson was allowed to teach, lecturing on mathematics, astronomy and optics. His teaching was highly appreciated.[4]/nWhiston was expelled from his chair on 30 October 1710; at the appeal of the heads of colleges, Queen Anne awarded Saunderson a Master of Arts degree on 19 November 1711 so that he would be eligible to succeed Whiston as Lucasian professor. He was chosen as the fourth Lucasian professor the next day, defeating the Trinity College candidate Christopher Hussey, backed by Richard Bentley, when the electors split 6 to 4 in his favour.[6] On 6 November 1718 Saunderson was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a member of the Spitalfields Mathematical Society.[4]/nHe was resident at Christ's College until 1723 when he married Abigail Dickons, daughter of William Dickons who was the rector of Boxworth, Cambridgeshire.[4] They lived in Cambridge with their children John and Anne. He was created doctor of laws in 1728 by command of George II during a visit by the monarch to Cambridge. He died of scurvy, on 19 April 1739 and was buried in the chancel of the parish church at Boxworth near Cambridge./nSaunderson possessed the friendship of leading mathematicians of the time: Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, Abraham De Moivre and Roger Cotes. His senses of hearing and touch were acute, and he was a good flautist. He could carry out mentally long and intricate mathematical calculations. He devised a calculating machine or abacus, by which he could perform arithmetical and algebraic operations by the sense of touch; it was known as his \"palpable arithmetic\", and was described in his Elements of Algebra. This book was prepared during the last six years of his life but published posthumously in 1740 by his widow and children aided by John Colson, the next Lucasian professor. This was used at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.[4]/nAnother of his writings, prepared for his pupils, was published in 1751 as The Method of Fluxions applied to a select number of useful problems, together with \u2026 an explanation of the principal propositions of Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy.[4]/nHis importance was as a charismatic and skilled teacher at exactly the time when mathematics started to become important at University of Cambridge. Part of Saunderson's role as the Lucasian professor was to disseminate the Principia Mathematica so that it was accessible to undergraduates and college tutors. Ultimately through his teaching during his term in office, he reformed the decaying, traditional curriculum of Cambridge to emphasize mathematics and Newtonian natural philosophy, defending it from opponents.[7] He provided the first systematic introduction to Differential calculus, detailed in his posthumous work The Method of Fluxions Applied to a Select Number of Useful Problems.[7]/nSaunderson did not follow the common practice of publishing his work; however, manuscripts of his lectures and treatises were in circulation and were used by a number of notable individuals including the astronomers James Bradley at Oxford University, Samuel Vince at Cambridge University and John Harrison for self-education prior to designing the marine chronometer.[7][4] After he died, his work The Elements of Algebra in Ten Books was published in his name.[8]/nThe discovery of Bayes' theorem remains a controversial topic in the history of mathematics. While it is certain to have been discovered before Thomas Bayes' time, there are several contenders for priority including Saunderson.  At the time, much of mathematics research was performed through the exchange of private letters, and through verbal discussions, rather than publications. Historian of statistics Stephen Stigler concluded that Saunderson was the most probable discoverer after attempting to trace some of these letters and discussions, but has been challenged by other statisticians.   Somewhat fittingly for a question about probability, it seems likely that the question will never be resolved completely but will remain as a probabilistic belief about Saunderson and others.[9]/nHe appears as a fictional character on his deathbed in eighteenth-century novelist Denis Diderot's Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who can see,[10] which discusses how man can acquire knowledge not only through perception, but also through reason.  His character represents a person with no perception but endowed with logical genius, trying to comprehend God.[11] This gives some indication of his celebrity status during his life, being used as an icon similarly to his chair's later occupant, Stephen Hawking, who also appears in debates about disability and genius./nIn Penistone, St John's Gardens at St John's Church features a memorial to Saunderson.[12]  His birthplace in a nearby house on Towngate, Thurlstone, bore a \"Hic Natus Est\" inscribed stone; the house is long gone (1950s) but the stone is built into a wall in a small garden at nearby Townend.[citation needed]  One of the old school buildings and a house of Penistone Grammar School, and a local residential street, Saunderson Gardens, are named after him.[13]/nIn 2006, Saunderson's life was turned into a musical, No Horizon, written by Andy Platt, headmaster of Springvale Primary School in Penistone.[14] The musical was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe from 3\u201327 August 2016./nAttributio", "46727387": "Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Schwartz (1913 \u2013 5 January 2013) was a French mathematician, known for her work on characteristic numbers of spaces with singularities.[1][2]/nBorn Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne L\u00e9vy, she was the daughter of mathematician Paul L\u00e9vy and the great-granddaughter of philologist Henri Weil.

In the same year he went to Paris, and in 1631 he was appointed the philosophy chair at Gervais College, Paris. Two years after that, in 1633, he was also made the chair of mathematics at the Royal College of France. A condition of tenure attached to this particular chair was that the holder (Roberval, in this case) would propose mathematical questions for solution, and should resign in favour of any person who solved them better than himself. Notwithstanding this, Roberval was able to keep the chair until his death.[2]/nRoberval was one of those mathematicians who, just before the invention of the infinitesimal calculus, occupied their attention with problems which are only soluble, or can be most easily solved, by some method involving limits or infinitesimals, which would today be solved by calculus. He worked on the quadrature of surfaces and the cubature of solids,  which he accomplished, in some of the simpler cases, by an original method which he called the \"Method of Indivisibles\"; but he lost much of the credit of the discovery as he kept his method for his own use, while Bonaventura Cavalieri published a similar method which he independently invented.[2]/nAnother of Roberval\u2019s discoveries was a very general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.[3] He also discovered a method of deriving one curve from another, by means of which finite areas can be obtained equal to the areas between certain curves and their asymptotes. To these curves, which were also applied to effect some quadratures, Evangelista Torricelli gave the name \"Robervallian lines.\"[2][4]/nBetween Roberval and Ren\u00e9 Descartes there existed a feeling of ill-will,[5][6] owing to the jealousy aroused in the mind of the former by the criticism that Descartes offered to some of the methods employed by him and by Pierre de Fermat; and this led him to criticize and oppose the analytical methods that Descartes introduced into geometry about this time.[2]/nAs results of Roberval\u2019s labours outside of pure mathematics may be noted a work on the system of the universe, in which he supports the Copernican heliocentric system and attributes a mutual attraction to all particles of matter and also the invention of a special kind of balance, the Roberval Balance.[7]", "60817685": "Shmuel Friedland (born 1944 in Tashkent, Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic)[1] is an Israeli-American mathematician./nFriedland studied at the Technion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology, graduating in 1967 with bachelor's degree and in 1971 with doctorate of science under the supervision of Binjamin Schwarz.[2] As a postdoc Friedland was in 1972/73 at the Weizmann Institute, in 1973/74 at Stanford University, and in 1974/75 at the Institute for Advanced Study.

Though her father was Catholic, Henney's mother was Jewish, which made her a target of the Nazi Party.[1][unreliable source?][unreliable source?] During the war, Henney's mother was taken to Auschwitz where she later died. Not long after, Henney and her father went on the run; splitting their time between the cities of Berlin and Hamburg in an effort to avoid the Nazi Party.

She had accumulated 63 transferable credits from her high school studies, and was able to matriculate rapidly at the University of Miami in Miami, Florida.[3] She continued to study mathematics, taking classes in nuclear physics and advanced calculus. It was also at this time that she developed a secondary interest in linguistic studies. Henney found a mentor in professor of linguistics Jack Reynolds. She enrolled in classes such as Middle English, Old English, and Chaucer linguistics.[1] In addition to her coursework, Henney took on part-time jobs in Miami. She worked as a movie theater cashier, making 57 cents an hour, and[4] taught classes at the university, teaching up to twelve credits a semester. At the age of 24, three years after she enrolled, Henney graduated from the University of Miami with a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in physics and a minor in mathematics and chemistry, as well as a Master of Science degree in pure mathematics.[1] It was during her freshman year at the University of Miami, Henney met her future husband, Alan G.

His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science./nLittle is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18 he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there till the age of 37 (c.\u2009347 BCE). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored his son Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls./nThough Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world, and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion./nAristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and was not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church./nAristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply \"The Philosopher\", while the poet Dante called him \"the master of those who know\". His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and Jean Buridan. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics./nIn general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.[A]/nAristotle was born in 384\u00a0BC[B] in Stagira, Chalcidice,[2] about 55\u00a0km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki.[3][4] His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. While he was young, Aristotle learned about biology and medical information, which was taught by his father.[5] Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian.[6] Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.[7]/nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy.[8] He probably experienced the Eleusinian Mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" [\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u0129\u03bd].[9] Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47\u00a0BCE. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.[10] Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. They had a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BCE, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander.[11][12]/nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal Academy of Macedon. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander.[13] Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\".[13] By 335\u00a0BCE, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira. They had a son whom Aristotle named after his father, Nicomachus. If the Suda \u2013 an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages \u2013 is accurate, he may also have had an er\u00f4menos, Palaephatus of Abydus.[14]/nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BCE, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.[12] He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, On the Soul and Poetics. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre.\"[15]/nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death.[16] Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322\u00a0BCE, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,[17] prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, on Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\"[18][19][20] \u2013 a reference to Athens's trial and execution of Socrates. He died in Chalcis, Euboea[2][21][15] of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.[22]/nWith the Prior Analytics, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic,[23] and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic.[24] Kant stated in the Critique of Pure Reason that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.[25]/nWhat is today called Aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism (methods of logical argument),[26] Aristotle himself would have labelled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean dialectics. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the Organon around 40 BCE by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers.[28] The books are:/nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in On Interpretation, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics)[31][32] and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The Rhetoric is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the Topics.[33]/nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century CE editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name Metaphysics.[34] Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (theoretik\u0113) philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his Metaphysics (1026a16):/nif there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal in just this way, because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.[35]/nAristotle examines the concepts of substance (ousia) and essence (to ti \u00ean einai, \"the what it was to be\") in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called hylomorphism. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers, etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.[36][34]/nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology places the universal (katholou) in particulars (kath' hekaston), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what phenomena are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.[34]/nPlato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When one looks at an apple, for example, one sees an apple, and one can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, one can place an apple next to a book, so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.[34][37]/nConcerning the nature of change (kinesis) and its causes, as he outlines in his Physics and On Generation and Corruption (319b\u2013320a), he distinguishes coming-to-be (genesis, also translated as 'generation') from:/nComing-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (dynamis) and actuality (entelecheia) in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) a plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate \u2013 being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise \u2013 acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and potentiality exists for the sake of the end, actuality, accordingly, is the end. Referring then to the previous example, it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.[34]/nFor that for the sake of which (to hou heneka) a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.[38]/nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.[34][39]/nAristotle's immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.[33] Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction, whereas Plato relies on deduction from a priori principles.[33]/nAristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.[40] In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". However, his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.[40]/nIn his On Generation and Corruption, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, earth, water, air, and fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets.[41]/nAristotle describes two kinds of motion: \"violent\" or \"unnatural motion\", such as that of a thrown stone, in the Physics (254b10), and \"natural motion\", such as of a falling object, in On the Heavens (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,[42][F] since Aristotle does not address friction.[43] With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.[44][G] This would imply the equation[44]/nincorrect in modern physics.[44]/nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,[H] while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.[45][43][I]/nIn the Physics (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density,[J] \u03c1, of the fluid in which it is falling:;[45][43]/nAristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible.[45][43] Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\"[43] that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative,[46] but other authors reject this.[43]/nArchimedes corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they displace enough water; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not, as Aristotle thought, its elementary composition.[45]/nAristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the Early Modern period. John Philoponus (in Late antiquity) and Galileo (in Early modern period) are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.[40] A contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli, who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the Earth's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not[45]), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.[44][K]/nNewton's \"forced\" motion corresponds to Aristotle's \"violent\" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus.[45]/nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term aitia is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.[48][49]/nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in Problems, book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.[51]/nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things, \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people's moral choices.[52][53]/nIn astronomy, Aristotle refuted Democritus's claim that the Milky Way was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,\" pointing out partly correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\"[54] He also wrote descriptions of comets, including the Great Comet of 371 BCE.[55]/nAristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations. He stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.[56][57]\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change, including \"lakes that had dried up\" and \"deserts that had become watered by rivers\", giving as examples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer, and \"the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.\"'[58]\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology (including his major writings \"Meteorologica\"). For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early \u2013 and correctly \u2013 that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (\"I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again.\")[59]/nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically,[60] and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.[61][62] His data in History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, and Parts of Animals are assembled from his own observations,[63] statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.[64] His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on botany have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.[65]/nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the catfish, electric ray, and frogfish in detail, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus. His description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.[66] He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants,[67] and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark.[68]/nHe notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function so birds like the heron (which live in marshes with soft mud and live by catching fish) have a long neck, long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet.[69] Darwin, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution.[70] Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.[71] To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor, or that one kind can change into another, or that kinds can become extinct.[72]/nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.[73] He used the ancient Greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.[74] In Generation of Animals, he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.[75][76]/nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.[77][78] This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.[77]/nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.[79]/nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals,[81][82] arranging these in the History of Animals in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the scala naturae, with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above plants, and these in turn were above minerals.[83][84] He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled \u2013 cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution.[85] Philosophers of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy,[86][87] but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise.[88][89][90] He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.[91]/nAristotle's psychology, given in his treatise On the Soul (peri psych\u0113s), posits three kinds of soul (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous (intellect) and logos (reason).[92]/nFor Aristotle, the soul is the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).[11] In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.[93] Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.[94]/nIn On the Soul, Aristotle famously criticizes Plato's theory of the soul and develops his own in response to Plato's. The first criticism is against Plato's view of the soul in the Timaeus that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies.[95] 20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle's interpretation of Plato and maintained that he had misunderstood Plato.[96] Today's scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle's interpretation and have warmed up to it.[97] Aristotle's other criticism is that Plato's view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis-matched; in principle, Aristotle alleges, any soul can go with any body, according to Plato's theory.[98] Aristotle's claim that the soul is the form of a living being is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation.[99]/nAccording to Aristotle in On the Soul, memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.[100] In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian 'common sense', and thinking.[101][102]/nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences, both for previous experience and present experience.[103]/nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.[104] Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.[105] Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.[106] Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.[107]/nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his laws of association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.[108][109]/nAristotle describes sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness.[110] Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses[111] or of digestion,[112] so it is vital to the body.[111] While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,[113] albeit differently,[110] unless they are weary.[111]/nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.[111] Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then looks away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.[110] When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.[111] However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.[110] So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.[114] During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.[110] This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.[110] In De Anima iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, phantasia.[11]/nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.[115] Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.[114]/nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.[40]/nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, most notably including the Nicomachean Ethics.[116]/nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (ergon) of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuch\u0113 (soul) in accordance with reason (logos). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency[15]) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well-being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (\u0113thik\u0113 aret\u0113), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.[117]/nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.[118]/nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled Politics. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".[119] He famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and argued that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.[120] Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.[121]/nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (polis) which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (koin\u014dnia). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences\".[L]/nIn Protrepticus, the character 'Aristotle' states:[122]/nFor we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.[122]/nAs Plato's disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and, following the outline of certain ideas from Plato's Statesman, he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:/nIt is \u2026 constitutional to take \u2026 from oligarchy that offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a property-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a democracy and as an oligarchy./nTo illustrate this approach, Aristotle proposed a first-of-its-kind mathematical model of voting, albeit textually described, where the democratic principle of \"one voter\u2013one vote\" is combined with the oligarchic \"merit-weighted voting\"; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see.[123]/nAristotle's views on women influenced later Western philosophers, who quoted him as an authority until the end of the Middle Ages, but these views have been controversial in modern times. Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. The biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction, which changes her body temperature, which in turn makes her, in Aristotle's view, incapable of participating in political life.[124] On this ground, proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny[125] and sexism.[126] However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.[M]/nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought, especially to thought in the Middle Ages.[128] In Politics, Aristotle addresses the city, property, and trade. His response to criticisms of private property, in Lionel Robbins's view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements.[128] Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from human nature. In Politics, Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money.[128] Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or silver.[129]/nAristotle's discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a profit. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.[129]/nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\".[129] He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".[129]/nAristotle's Rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ethos (an appeal to the speaker's character), pathos (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and logos (an appeal to logical reasoning).[130] He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: epideictic (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), forensic (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and deliberative (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).[131] Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs: enthymeme (proof by syllogism) and paradeigma (proof by example).[132]/nAristotle writes in his Poetics that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.[133][134] He applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention[133] and contends that the audience's realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself.[133] Aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals[133][135] and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\".[133] Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\"[136] For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation \u2013 through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.[137]/nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's Poetics originally comprised two books \u2013 one on comedy and one on tragedy \u2013 only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.[139] The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.[140] Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop.[141]/nMore than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived.[142][143][144] He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\".[145]/nAmong countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic,[146] pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.[2][147][148] Taneli Kukkonen, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric, and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\"[148] Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\".[149]/nAristotle has been called the father of logic, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, natural law, scientific method, rhetoric, psychology, realism, criticism, individualism, teleology, and meteorology.[151]/nThe scholar Taneli Kukkonen notes that \"in the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.\"[148] What follows is an overview of the transmission and influence of his texts and ideas into the modern era./nAristotle's pupil and successor, Theophrastus, wrote the History of Plants, a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as carpel from carpos, fruit, and pericarp, from pericarpion, seed chamber.[152]\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.[153][154]/nThe immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle's students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\"[155]/nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.[156] It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found./nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not.[157] Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. Ernst Mayr states that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\"[158]/nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century.[159] John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.[160] Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations.[161]/nAfter a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.[162]/nAristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,[163] as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. Alkindus greatly admired Aristotle's philosophy,[164] and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future philosophers.[165] Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\".[163] The title was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.[166]/nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c.\u2009CE 600 to c.\u20091100 except through the Latin translation of the Organon made by Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona,[167] and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke./nAfter the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his Summa Theologica, working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher\",[168] the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance.[169] These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, Peter Abelard, and John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic.[170]/nAccording to scholar Roger Theodore Lafferty, Dante built up the philosophy of the Comedy with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. Dante knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of Albert Magnus.[171] Dante even acknowledges Aristotle's influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno's structure by citing the Nicomachean Ethics.[172] Dante famously refers to him as \"he / Who is acknowledged Master of those who know\".[173][174]/nMoses Maimonides (considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval Judaism)[175] adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his Guide for the Perplexed on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Maimonides also considered Aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived, and styled him as the \"chief of the philosophers\".[176][177][178] Also, in his letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon, Maimonides observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are \"sufficient by themselves and [superior] to all that were written before them. His intellect, Aristotle's is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, there being no level higher\".[179]/nIn the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought.[180] Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.[181]/nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided \"to go under, over, and beyond\" it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book The Laws of Thought. This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.[182]/nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\".[183][184] Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species', Darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as Aristotle;[185] the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles.[186]/nThe philosopher Bertrand Russell claims that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell calls Aristotle's ethics \"repulsive\", and labelled his logic \"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\". Russell states that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.[187]/nThe Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis writes that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their senses.[188] In 1985, the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in \"pure seventeenth century\"[189] tones that Aristotle had assembled \"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility\".[189][190]/nZoologists have frequently mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed several of his more surprising claims.[191][192][193] Aristotle's work remains largely unknown to modern scientists, though zoologists sometimes mention him as the father of biology[150] or in particular of marine biology.[194] Practising zoologists are unlikely to adhere to Aristotle's chain of being, but its influence is still perceptible in the use of the terms \"lower\" and \"upper\" to designate taxa such as groups of plants.[195] The evolutionary biologist Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle's biology,[196] while Niko Tinbergen's four questions, based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse animal behaviour; they examine function, phylogeny, mechanism, and ontogeny.[197][198] The concept of homology began with Aristotle;[199] the evolutionary developmental biologist Lewis I. Held commented that he would be interested in the concept of deep homology.[200]/nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school.[201] Reference to them is made according to the organization of Immanuel Bekker's Royal Prussian Academy edition (Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831\u20131870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.[202]/nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era.[N] His writings are divisible into two groups: the \"exoteric\", intended for the public, and the \"esoteric\", for use within the Lyceum school.[204][O][205] Aristotle's \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication.[206][204] Cicero's description of Aristotle's literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes.[P] A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones now possessed came to be found.[208] The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.[209][210]/nAccording to Strabo and Plutarch, after Aristotle's death, his library and writings went to Theophrastus (Aristotle's successor as head of the Lycaeum and the Peripatetic school).[211] After the death of Theophrastus, the peripatetic library went to Neleus of Scepsis.[212]:\u200a5/nSome time later, the Kingdom of Pergamon began conscripting books for a royal library, and the heirs of Neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose. The library was stored there for about a century and a half, in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation. On the death of Attalus III, which also ended the royal library ambitions, the existence of Aristotelian library was disclosed, and it was purchased by Apellicon and returned to Athens in about 100\u00a0BCE.[212]:\u200a5\u20136/nApellicon sought to recover the texts, many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored. He had them copied out into new manuscripts, and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable.[212]:\u200a5\u20136/nWhen Sulla seized Athens in 86\u00a0BCE, he seized the library and transferred it to Rome. There, Andronicus of Rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of Aristotle's works (and works attributed to him).[213] The Aristotelian texts we have to day are based on these.[212]:\u200a6\u20138/nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder,[214] Justus van Gent, Raphael, Paolo Veronese, Jusepe de Ribera,[215] Rembrandt,[216] and Francesco Hayez over the centuries. Among the best-known depictions is Raphael's fresco The School of Athens, in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, where the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural vanishing point, reflecting their importance.[217] Rembrandt's Aristotle with a Bust of Homer, too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones writes, \"this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.\"[218][219]/nThe Aristotle Mountains in Antarctica are named after Aristotle.

As a youth, according to the historian John Cawte Beaglehole, Wales travelled south in the company of a Mr Holroyd, who became a plumber in the service of George III.[1] By the mid-1760s, Wales was contributing to The Ladies' Diary. In 1765 he married Mary Green, sister of the astronomer Charles Green.[1]/nIn 1765, Wales was employed by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne as a computer, calculating ephemerides that could be used to establish the longitude of a ship, for Maskelyne's Nautical Almanac.[2]/nAs part of the plans of the Royal Society to make observations of the June 1769 transit of Venus, which would lead to an accurate determination of the astronomical unit (the distance between the Earth and the Sun), Wales and an assistant, Joseph Dymond, were sent to Prince of Wales Fort on Hudson Bay to observe the transit,[3] with the pair being offered a reward of \u00a3200 for a successful conclusion to their expedition.[1] Other Royal Society expeditions associated with the 1769 transit were Cook's first voyage to the Pacific, with observations of the transit being made at Tahiti, and the expedition of Jeremiah Dixon and William Bayly to Norway./nDue to winter pack ice making the journey impossible during the winter months, Wales and Dymond were obliged to begin their journey in the summer of 1768, setting sail on 23 June.

She received her A.B. from Barnard College in 1908, her M.A. from Columbia University in 1911, and her Ph.D. (in chemistry) from Clark University in 1914, under Martin's direction; at Clark, Solomon Lefschetz was a classmate.[4] She married Hugh Gray Lieber on October 27, 1926.[2]/nAfter teaching at Hunter College from 1908 to 1910, and in the New York City high school system (1910\u20131912, 1914\u20131915), she became a Research Fellow at Bryn Mawr College from 1915 to 1917; she then went on to teach at Wells College from 1917 to 1918 as Instructor of Physics (also acting as head of the physics department), and at the Connecticut College for Women (1918 to 1920).[2] She joined the mathematics department at Long Island University (LIU) in Brooklyn, New York (LIU Brooklyn) in 1934, became department chair in 1945 (taking over from Hugh when he became Professor, and Chair, of Art at LIU [4]), and was made a full professor in 1947, until her retirement in 1954; she was appointed director of LIU's Galois Institute of Mathematics (later the Galois Institute of Mathematics and Art) (named for \u00c9variste Galois) in 1934.[1][5] Over her career she published some 17 books, which were written in a unique, free-verse style and illustrated with whimsical line drawings by her husband. Her highly accessible writings were praised by no less than Albert Einstein, Cassius Jackson Keyser, Eric Temple Bell, and S. I. Hayakawa. Concerning her book, The Education of T. C. MITS, Dorothy Canfield Fisher said:/nThis is quite different from any other book you ever bought... full of mathematics and full of humor... also full of a deep, healing philosophy of life, reassuring, strengthening, [and] humane...\"[6]/nShe edited several volumes of Galois lectures, including Martin's A Practical Simplification of the Method of Least Squares, several talks by Alonzo Church, and Lattice Theory by Garrett Birkhoff.[4] \nAlthough Lieber retired from Long Island University in 1954, she continued to write and publish into the 1960s./nFew details of Lillian Lieber's life and career have survived, even at Long Island University.

C. MITS:/nT.C. MITS was an acronym for \"The Celebrated Man In The Street,\" a character who, like George Gamow's  Mr Tompkins, served as a device for bringing concepts in higher mathematics and physics to the general public. The MITS character was central to Lieber's populist approach to education, and she often laced her expositions with passages extolling the virtues of the democratic system./nIn her book, The Einstein Theory of Relativity, Lillian Lieber stated her views on the inclusion of mathematics in books intended for \"the celebrated man [or woman] in the streets:\"/n...just enough mathematics to HELP and NOT to HINDER the lay reader... Many 'popular' discussions of Relativity, without any mathematics at all, have been written. But we doubt whether even the best of these can possibly give to a novice an adequate idea of what it is all about....

He is a professor of mathematics at University of California Berkeley, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[1] and author of the bestselling book Love and Math.[2]/nEdward Frenkel was born on May 2, 1968, in Kolomna, Russia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. His father is of Jewish descent and his mother is Russian.[3][2] As a high school student he studied higher mathematics privately with Evgeny Evgenievich Petrov, although his initial interest was in quantum physics rather than mathematics.[4] He was not admitted to Moscow State University because of discrimination against Jews[5] and enrolled instead in the applied mathematics program at the Gubkin University of Oil and Gas. While a student there, he attended the seminar of Israel Gelfand and worked with Boris Feigin and Dmitry Fuchs. After receiving his degree in 1989, he was first invited to Harvard University as a visiting professor, and a year later he enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard.[6] He received his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1991, after one year of study, under the direction of Boris Feigin and Joseph Bernstein.[7] He was a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1991 to 1994, and served as an associate professor at Harvard from 1994 to 1997. He has been a professor of mathematics at University of California, Berkeley, since 1997./nJointly with Boris Feigin, Frenkel constructed the free field realizations of affine Kac\u2013Moody algebras (these are also known as Wakimoto modules), defined the quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction, and described the center of the universal enveloping algebra of an affine Kac\u2013Moody algebra, sometimes called the Feigin\u2013Frenkel center. The last result, often referred to as Feigin\u2013Frenkel isomorphism, has been used by Alexander Beilinson and Vladimir Drinfeld in their work on the geometric Langlands correspondence. Together with Nicolai Reshetikhin, Frenkel introduced deformations of W-algebras and q-characters of representations of quantum affine algebras./nFrenkel's recent work has focused on the Langlands program and its connections to representation theory, integrable systems, geometry, and physics. Together with Dennis Gaitsgory and Kari Vilonen, he has proved the geometric Langlands conjecture for GL(n).

He returned to Aligarh and passed his B.A in 1895 in first division, standing first among science students, and was awarded Starchy Gold Medal. Soon after passing B.A., he was appointed assistant lecturer in mathematics at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College./nOn the basis of merit, he was nominated for the post of deputy collector, but Ahmad declined the offer and elected to continue in the service of the college. Sir Syed offered him a permanent appointment in the grade of Rs 60-100, provided he signed a bond to serve for a period of five years. He responded by undertaking to serve for his entire life. A highly impressed Sir Syed tore up the bond.[3]/nAhmad completed his BA in mathematics (with distinction) from Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1895. He was the first Muslim to obtain a D.Sc. (Mathematics), from Allahabad University. His field was complex logarithms applications. He published in differential geometry and algebraic geometry.[10] He won the Lytton Strachey Gold Medal in 1897.[9][11] While teaching, he continued his education and earned M.A. degrees from Calcutta and Allahabad Universities and also a D.Sc. degree from the University of Allahabad in 1901./nIn 1901, Ahmad left for England on a government scholarship and obtained his honours degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. He was awarded the Isaac Newton Scholarship in 1904, the first Indian awardee becoming the first Indian to secure this coveted honour. He became a Wrangler He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and London Mathematical Society.[10][12] Thereafter He joined the Gointtingen University in Germany in 1904 and received a PhD from the University of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany.[13] He visited University of Paris and University of Bologna, Italy for advanced studies in modern geometry.[14] He did research in astronomy in Bologna, Italy. He visited Al Azhar University, Cairo to understand their academic methodologies./nOn his return to India in 1907, Ahmad joined his alma mater. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the AMU Foundation and Constitution Committees. He became a professor of history at Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College and in 1918 was selected principal.[12] He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in King's Birthday Honours list.[7]/nHe coached students who were seeking admission at Roorkie Engineering College. He held seminars and coached students in engineering and forestry./nAhmad paid to bring students to Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College. One of the most notable was Hasrat Mohani, who hailed from Kanpur and was planning to go to Lucknow. Ahmad noticed Mohani's math talent and went to Kanpur to convince him and his family to attend MAO College.[12]/nHe was appointed assistant master in MAO College[3] and served as Acting Principal for a time in 1913.[2]/nAlong with Professor Chakravarti, Ahmad cofounded the first group of researchers focused on Astronomy, History of Mathematics and Theory of Functions. They made innovations in teaching and other discoveries.[15]/nIn 1890, MAO College Mathematics Society was formed with him as president and A.M. Kureishy as secretary. The society continues as Aligarh Mathematical Society. The Department of Mathematics was founded when MAO College was given the status of a residential University in 1920, becoming one of its oldest departments. Ahmad was the first professor and head of the department.[15]/nPrincipal of the College Beck and Sir Morrison proposed that Ahmad be appointed Deputy Collector with UP Government, which paid Rs. 500/-. He declined the offer in favor of a position as assistant lecturer at the college making Rs. 60/- per month. Khan offered Ahmad a five-year contract, but Ahmad told him that he planned to spend his life there and that anyone who would stay only to complete a contract would not be worth keeping. Khan tore up the contract[16] and Ahmad's career as a teacher began. To keep his promise to Khan, he left the Indian Civil Service./nAhmad also taught other subjects. For example, in 1897, Professor Arnold, who taught logic, resigned. The budget did not have room for a faculty member from England and so Ahmad took over.[2]/nAt the time of the Government of India Resolution in 1913 five universities operated in India. Colleges were outside the control of the various universities. At this time London University was reorganised per recommendations of the Royal Commission. A decision to reform Indian Universities led to a second university commission, the 1917 Calcutta University Commission.[16] The members of the commission were Sir Ziauddin,[16] Dr. Gregory, Ramsay Muir, Sir Hartog, Dr. Horniel and Sir Asutosh Mukerji.[16]/nAt the time of the Government of India Resolution in 1913 there were only five universities in India and the number of colleges was beyond the control of the various universities within their territorial limits. As a result, different administrative problems piled up in that period. Sir Asutosh Mukherji was the vice chancellor of Calcutta University.[17] He started imparting post-graduate education in the university in 1916 as recommended by the University Education Commission of 1902. This has attracted the attention of the Government. By this time the London University was reorganised and reformed as per recommendations of the Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Halden. Therefore, it became a necessity to reform the Indian Universities also. All these circumstances led to the formation of the second university commission. i.e., Calcutta University Commission, 1917./nThe commission reviewed the entire field from school education to university education.[8] The Sadler Commission held the view that improved secondary education was a necessary condition for the improvement of university education.[8]/nThe British Government of India appointed the Indian Sandhurst Committee also known as Skeen Committee in March 1925 with the objective of reform and Indianisation of British Indian Army.[18] This committee was consisted of Lt.General Sir Andrew Skeen who was the then Chief of General Staff of India as chairman, and 12 Indian of Military and civil stature as its member. Sir Ziauddin along with Motilal Nehru, M.A.Jinnah, Sardar Jogendra Singh, Sir Phiroze Sethna, Ramachandra Rao, Sahibzada Abdul Qaiyum, Capt. Hira Singh, Capt. J.N. Banerjee, Major Thaku Zorawar Singh were its members. This committee met for the first time in Shimla and quickly decided upon its working. It studied French, American, Canadian, British military system and submitted its report within 6 months. The committee recommended the opening of a Military college in India at Dehradoon which later become Indian Military Academy.[19]/nIn 1911, a Central Committee was set up to transform MAO College into a university, with Raja Sahib Mahmudabad, India as president, Syed Ali Bilgrami as secretary and Ahmad as joint secretary. The college had to raise Rs. 30 lakh (3 million) for elevation to university status, which was achieved in 1915. The student body at that time was less than 1500. Ahmad traveled across India to raise funds.[2]/nHe established most of the departments of AMU. He collected funds to open a Medical College at AMU, which later became Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC). He drafted the new university's Constitution./nThe university named its dental college after Ziauddin Ahmad. He founded the Commerce and Polytechnic Departments and several other departments. On his recommendation Abdullah School merged with Aligarh Muslim University (AMU)./nHe became AMU's first pro-vice-chancellor.[2] He was elected vice-chancellor in 1934, remaining until 1946, becoming its longest serving VC.[1] He became an honorary professor in the department of Mathematics, working simultaneously as vice-chancellor. Because of his love for the subject, he taught courses both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.[15] He was AMU's only teaching VC./nWith his help, Islamia College was established in Lahore, now called Government Islamia College, Lahore. Ahmad laid the foundation stone for the college and for Islamia College, Peshawar./nHe recommended students for all kinds of employment, ranging from clerical and administrative to military. Ahmad visited students in their dormitories and mediated sometimes violent student disputes. Habib A. Zuberi, who was also Ahmad's student, writes, \"In 1946-47, when I was a student in Xth class at M.U. High School,...he lectured us either once or twice a week....He was a fine teacher. His goal was to include Trigonometry in High School curriculum.\" Ahmad encouraged informal relations between faculty and students. The university emphasized sports and had a Riding School, a unit of U.O.T.C., and an active Student Union, where students elected their leaders and participated in debates.[citation needed]/nWhen the British hung the father of Pir Pagara, Pir Sabghatullah Shah Rashidi, on 20 March 1943, and abolished his Gaddi (Spiritual Office), Pir Pagara Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II was hardly 15 years old. During the same year Ahmad, at that time AMU vice-chancellor, took him and his brother to Aligarh.[20] At Aligarh the brothers stayed in 'English House', a hostel established to house the sons of nawabs and rajas. In 1946 Ahmad arranged for their education in England.[20]/nHe was known for throwing parties,[11] often entertaining visiting dignitaries at his house. He often invited people for dinner with ever-swelling guest lists./nIn 1920, Indian Muslims, led by Maulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar and his brother Maulana Shaukat Ali, launched a movement to restore the Khilafat (caliphate) in Turkey. The Turks themselves had no use for the Khilafat and had chosen Mustafa Kemal Pasha as their leader; the Arabs did not want it and the British opposed it. The Congress party supported their efforts and on 9 September 1920, passed a resolution which began the non-cooperation movement. This movement was hailed as a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in India.[2]/nOn 11 October 1920, the Ali brothers visited Aligarh with Swami Satya Dev and Gandhiji. These leaders were invited to address the MAO College Student Union. The students passed a resolution in support of non-cooperation with the British government, condemned the British attitude towards Turkey, demanded that the college accept no grants from the government and discontinue affiliation with Allahabad University. Furthermore, the resolution asked to change MAO College into a National University independent of the government.[2]/nAhmad had accepted Khan Ahmed Khan's thesis that Muslims should not get involved in politics until reaching educational parity with other Indian communities. He approached the university authorities, and convinced them to keep the college out of this struggle. When the crisis deepened, he closed the college and sent the students home.[2]/nAhmad made great efforts to bring about reconciliation between the members of the board of trustees, and succeeded in bringing most students back to campus. In honor of Ahmad, who was now known as Doctor Sahib, the faculty and staff on campus gave a dinner to which college trustees as well as British officers of Aligarh and Agra were invited. Khawaja Abdul Majeed, one of the trustees who did not support him initially, stated: \"I was against Dr. Sahib\u2019s appointment as Principal, but the improvements that have resulted under his leadership have convinced me that this will be good for the future of students, staff, honorary Secretary, public and the relations with the government.\"[21]/nAhmad had opposed a popular movement and risked alienating the Muslim masses. He had to choose between supporting a popular movement and losing government support (financial and otherwise) or establishing a Muslim University with government assistance./nWhen classes resumed, a sizeable number of students stayed home. It appeared that the sharp decline in enrollment the college would cost the college its elevation. Dr. Sahib visited several towns and convince most of the students to return, while new students enrolled. However, Ahmad earned the wrath of people who continued to oppose him thereafter. At the same time, he found a solid base that supported him.[2]/nOn 1 December 1920, the Muslim University Act passed, and thus MAO College became Aligarh Muslim University.[2] Raja Mahmudabad became the first vice-chancellor and Ahmad, pro-vice-chancellor. Raja Sahib was not particularly in favor of Dr. Sahib becoming the PVC, instead preferring an Englishman. When no European was willing to accept this position and no other capable Muslim was available, he accepted Ahmad. The University Act stated that the PVC would become \"the principal academic officer of the university.\" It was further stipulated that in the absence of the vice chancellor the PVC would act as the chairman of the Academic Council. Dr. Sahib and Raja Sahib often held differing views on managing university affairs. After a year, Raja Sahib resigned and Nawabzada Aftab Ahmed Khan became the V.C. In 1922, Dr. Sahib was re-elected to the State Assembly.[2]/nFundamental disagreements developed between Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan and Dr. Sahib. Sahibzada was a lawyer and was a stickler for rules and regulations, while Dr. Sahib maintained that \"rules are made for students; students are not made for rules.\" Dr. Amir Husain Siddiqui stated, \"Dr. Ahmad created educational aids, reduced fees and other expenditure, relaxed the rules for admission and examinations and encouraged extra lectures for those who fell short of attendance.\".[22] These policies made him popular among students and parents. He introduced a system of private examinations, because the government did not permit the affiliation of colleges and schools to the university. It was not clear whether students could appear in exams as private candidates, but he continued this practice while pro-vice-chancellor./nIn 1925, the university administration celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the foundation of Aligarh College. At this time differences between the VC and the PVC surfaced. Dr. Sahib decided to take a leave and asked the VC to appoint a replacement. Sahibzada refused his request and prevailed upon him to continue as PVC./nThe Jubilee was celebrated on a grand scale, and raised Rs 176,000/-. Dr. Sahib reserved these funds for the establishment of an Engineering College and Departments of Applied Physics and Applied Chemistry. However, by law the university was required to obtain permission from the government and the effort was unsuccessful./nIn February 1926, Dr. Sahib's term as PVC ended and with Sahibzada Sahib recommendation began another term. However, when Sahibzada's own term as VC ended in December 1926, the trustees appointed Nawab Sir Muzzamil Ullah Khan in his place. Before leaving Sahibzada wrote a pamphlet pointing out irregularities for which he held Dr. Sahib responsible. He sent a copy to the Viceroy, to Begum Bhopal (Chancellor) and to the trustees. Moin-ul-Haque, who was on the History Department faculty, claimed that Dr. Sahib was willing to break rules to aid students in graduating and finding work.[23]/nThe pamphlet resulted in the formation of an inquiry committee. The committee expressed appreciation of Dr. Sahib services, but recommended that he take a six-month paid leave with pay and then retire. Before the University Court could meet to discuss the issue, Dr. Sahib submitted his resignation, to take effect from 27 April 1928, declining the offer of leave with pay. Farewell parties produced poems in his honor. One staff member, Qazi Jalal Uddin, wrote a two-page poem./nThe vice-president of the Student Union, in his farewell address, stated: \"If Khan was the founder of this institution, you are beyond a question its savior.\" After 33 years, Ahmad left Aligarh on 27 April 1928. According to Zia-i-Hayat, almost the entire student body came to bid him farewell at the railway station.[2]/nSeven years after he had left Aligarh, Ahmad returned to the University on 19 April 1935, as vice-chancellor. He immediately made plans to improve the Science Faculty. Although plans for a building for Tibbiya College had been discussed earlier, Dr. Sahib moved to make it a reality. The work was completed in 1940. At that time Sir Shah Sulaiman was serving as vice chancellor.[clarification needed] Dr. Sahib next launched a program to establish an Institute of Technology. Nawab of Jungadh donated Rs 50,000/- to this program. Nawab Muzzamil Ullah Khan donated his Johnson Factory Building to the effort along with two of his old cars, so that students enrolled in the motor engineering course could work on them.[24]/nIn 1937, Ahmad proposed a College of Technology to prepare students for work in electrical, mechanical, sanitary and civil engineering and agriculture. Other related subjects included applied chemistry, electro-chemistry, and textile chemistry. In the same year, the Technology workshop opened. Its foundation stone was laid by Nawab Sahib of Rampur./nIn 1937, Girls Intermediate College became a Degree College and affiliated with the university. At the same time, upon Ahmad's recommendation, for the first time, girls were admitted to their Teachers Training College./nDr. Sahib also proposed a military college./nHis first term ended on 30 April 1938. He was succeeded by Sir Shah Suleiman, a judge of the Federal Court, who then died on 13 March 1941. Ahmad was appointed vice-chancellor for the second time on 24 April 1941./nTibbiya College became his administration's top priority. Work on the college building was completed 1943 due to scarcity of resources. His second priority was the establishment of a full-fledged Engineering College. This goal was achieved by 1945. He made an effort to establish an airport near the university in 1942. Nawab Sahib Bhopal contributed Rs 50,000/- to build an aeronautics workshop. The university acquired a plane as well, enabling students to take flying lessons. Ahmad proposed to establish a department of applied physics and to attach it to the College of Engineering./nAhmad's second term as VC came to an end in 1943 and he was reappointed. In 1944, he proposed to establish a medical College at Aligarh, for which he collected a sum of Rs. 50 lakh (5 million) by the end of 1946. In 1945, Commerce College opened. He then began to shift his focus from career training to scholarship and the quality of education./nIn December 1946 some students spread a rumor, encouraged by his enemies, that Dr. Sahib had confiscated all copies of a magazine that reported riots in Bihar and that he was going to have its student author arrested. Between 250 and 300 students marched to the vice-chancellor's office shouting slogans, \"Ahmad Must Go.\" Dr. Sahib remained in his office and asked student representatives what they wanted. They asked for his resignation, which he immediately resigned.[25]/nIn the evening, around 500\u2013600 students went to his house shouting, \"Ahmad come back.\" He did not withdraw his resignation, despite the entreaties of the executive council and the court. The court unanimously passed a resolution expressing their confidence in his leadership, and recommended his appointment as rector of the university\u2014to which he acceded.[5]/nHe devoted the rest of his time to raising funds for Aligarh's medical college. M.S. Aney, Governor of Bihar, wrote about Dr. Sahib: \"\u2026Last I met him was when he came to Colombo on a deputation of the Aligarh University to collect funds for the Medical College. I believe he made handsome collections there and was received very warmly, not just by Mohammedans at Colombo, but by other communities also. I had great respect for his learning and versatility.\"[26]/nBy 1915, he was taking interest in public affairs and in technical and vocational education.[12] He was appointed Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of UP in 1919 and 1922 as representative of Allahabad University. He presided over the second Muslim Kamboh Conference held at Marehra (District Etha UP) on 21 and 22 April 1935 at Marison Islamia School.[1]/nIn 1924, he was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Muslim Constituency of Mainpuri, Etah and Farrukhabad./nHe was elected a Member of the Central Assembly in 1930.[1] He was repeatedly elected from different constituencies and served in the Central Legislature until 1947. In 1946, he was the chief whip of the Muslim League in the Central Assembly./nHe was knighted in the 1938 New Year Honours list.[7]/nHe sponsored the Indian Foreign Relations Act in Parliament. Ahmad worked on the budget for the Indian Railways and with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). When RBI was founded he was involved in moving legislation for its more efficient functioning.[27]/nIn 1931 Anwer Noor, in the Frontier Province, was so offended by an assistant commissioner that he attacked him. The officer was not injured, but Noor was nevertheless executed, creating a political issue. A committee was appointed to submit a report. However, the government seized the report before it was published. Ahmad stated that no harm had come to the assistant commissioner, that Noor had had no chance to appeal and that the government should say what greater punishment should follow a more serious attack. The colonial government thereafter withdrew the laws in question.[28]/nAfter the demise of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan in 1898, Sir Syed Memorial Fund was created in different parts of country and the effort for the establishment of a Muslim University was sped up. All the persons associated with this movement wanted all Muslim institutions of India to be affiliated to the Muslim University./nDr. Sir Ziauddin, while presenting the idea of the Muslim University at Lahore session of All India Muslim Educational Conference in 1898, discussed at length the concept of a university and emphasized the importance of the right of affiliating colleges./nAhmad moved a billentral Legislative Assembly to amend the University Act 1920 to empower AMU to recognize and affiliate Schools and Colleges outside Aligarh. However, due to empathy of British ruler towards education of Indians the bill failed.[11] In February, 2011, this vision was realised by the opening of two Centres of Aligarh Muslim University in Mallapuram, Kerala and Murshidabad, West Bengal.[29] In November 2013, the university opened a third satellite, in Kishanganj, Bihar./nAhmad was an originally member of the Independent Party, which included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. When this party dissolved he joined the Muslim League and served as its Parliamentary Secretary. In evaluating his performance in the Assembly, N.V Gadgil wrote: \"Dr. Ahmad Ahmed was a popular figure in the Central Assembly during the period of my membership of that body. He was very well informed on Railway and General Finance\u2026 He was catholic in his hospitality, charitable towards friends and a conscientious legislator...\"[30]/nHe was also a member of the East India Railway Company's board of directors, and the viceroy appointed him as a member of his defense council. Ahmad was knighted by the Crown. During World War II he served as a lieutenant colonel.[2]/nAhmad left India for Europe and America in 1947. While on a plane returning from Paris to London, he suffered a stroke. The stroke was followed by pneumonia. When his condition slightly improved, he invited Aligarians living in London for tea. He advised them to go back to India upon completing their education. He even requested his physician, Ghayasuddin, to move to India. Krishna Menon, India's High Commissioner in U.K, visited Ahmad several times, as did Pakistan's high commissioner, Habib Ibrahim Rahimtoola.[11] He died in London on 23 December 1947. His body, as he had requested, was sent back to Aligarh.[1]/nMany people visited his family.[11] At that time Nawab Ismail Khan was serving as vice chancellor. University authorities decided that Ahmad should be buried in the university mosque. His body was brought to the Cricket Pavilion for viewing.[11] Students overruled the administration's choice of burial site and prepared his grave next to that of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. His tomb stone is inscribed with Allama Iqbal's couplet, \"Hazarooun Saal Nargis Upni Bay Noori Pay Routi Hay Bari Mushkil Say Houta Hay Chaman Mein Deeda Were Paida.\"[1]/nSir Ziauddin is a part of the famous Zuberi family. Sir Ziauddin's son, Zakauddin Ahmad, had three children: Anjum Zia (female), Nigaht Zia (female), and Ahmad Ziauddin (Ahmad Zia).

He authored several works, including a collection of poems on the Flemish wars, (Cinque primi canti della guerra di Fiandra, 1551), one detailing military fortifications (Della fortificatione delle citt\u00e0, by his friend Giacomo Fusto Castriotto, but edited, annotated, and published posthumously by Maggi in 1564), and several on the subject of philosophy./nMaggi was born in Anghiari, Tuscany.  Little is known about his youth. His year of birth is unknown; several authors have speculated, based on varying access to information. Maggi specifically mentioned how, in infancy, he was attacked by the same pestilence which, in 1563, he states was the most recent one to occur.  This was most likely the black death of 1527 spread by Charles V's Protestant mercenaries (Landsknechts) when they defeated the French and pillaged the Vatican, but may have been one of the following year or of three years later. His parents were Paolo and Luisa, who quickly left him an orphan.[2]/nAs a young man, Maggi studied oratory with Pierantonio Ghezzi from Laterina, a master of Latin. Afterwards, to proceed with the then popular studies, he went at first to the nearby University of Perugia, then to that of Pisa, and finally to that of Bologna. In Pisa, he attended the lectures of the famous professor of Latin and Greek oratory, Francis Robortello, who was a faculty member from 1543 to 1549.[2]/nMaggi, who beyond his native Tuscan, had mastered Latin and was erudite in Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish. Availing himself of such endowments, he went into jurisprudence, more to examine its spirit than its profession. Initially, he studied the method of Andrea Alciato, then that of Bartolo da Sassoferrato and the 14th and 15th century schools of thought.[2]/nHe became interested in ancient history, and quickly began studying epigraphy and architectonics. As part of this interest, Maggi accumulated a large collection of ancient tombstones, including ones from Como, Ravenna, Rieti, Foligno, Perugia and Rome. In Pisa, where he was still engaged in formal studies, and in other Italian cities, he visited and examined sepulchres and sarcophagi, and used his growing knowledge to dispute a universally accepted belief of the time: the idea of the existence of giants in ancient days. All of this work formed the bases for his tractatus on sepulchres. He worked diligently to provide correct interpretations of ancient works of Roman law and, for his successful explanation of a section of the Pandects of Justinian, as he himself tells the story, he was embraced and kissed by Robertello. In Pisa, he probably obtained his doctoral degree in 1546, and returned to his native land two years later.[2]/nIn 1548, he was requested by his fellow citizens to visit Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He began this endeavor in Venice, the city where in those times, the greatest Italian minds lived quietly and profited greatly from their studies, due to the vast commerce of books fueled by the carefulness and tolerance of the government; there he again saw Robortello, and started a friendship with the famous writer Pietro Aretino. Maggi, who had nothing to offer, may have sought protection from Aretino, or hoped to avoid harsh criticism from him, when he sang the following hendecasyllabic verses, published in his 1551 Guerro di Fiandro (Canto II, verse 56):[2]/nPleased by the words, Aretino sent this poem on the Flemish wars to Chiapino Vitelli, the famous Spanish mercenary general, in February 1551, along with a letter praising Maggi's talents. Vitelli's family owned much land around Anghiari, in an area only a few miles from the Maggi estate. So, Maggi endeavored to please Vitelli, a soldier of Cosimo, to obtain good entrance at the royal court in Florence. He also praised Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, father of Cosimo I, whose daring son's rise to the throne of Florence well represented Maggi's goal. In five canti, Maggi often complained about his sad fate, showing himself unhappy with the legal profession exercised by him out of necessity.[2]/nHe was a judge and military defense engineer in Famagusta on Cyprus when the island was invaded by Ottoman Turks in 1571. Besieged by the Turks, he invented machines to defend Famagusta against their attacks. When the island was conquered, Maggi was sent to the dungeons at Constantinople where, locked in chains, he wrote from memory two detailed treatises, De tintinnabulis, on bells and carillons, and the explicitly illustrated De equuleo, on torture devices./nIn attempts to be freed, he dedicated the first treatise to Carolus Rym (Charles Ramire), ambassador to the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II, and the second treatise to Fran\u00e7ois de Noailles, bishop of Aire and ambassador to the King of France. They were pleased with his works, and endeavoured to obtain his release. Their efforts, however, were brought to light as he was being released to the Italian ambassador.

In addition, Martin led a significant expansion of the college\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including innovations such as the LSA Laptop Program, which provides computers to students with financial need; the Kessler Presidential Scholars, serving first-generation students; and the LSA Collegiate Fellows, which aimed to recruit 50 outstanding young faculty members who have expertise in equity and inclusion./nMartin was appointed Washington University\u2019s 15th chancellor by the university\u2019s Board of Trustees on July 14, 2018.[3] He began full-time service to the university on January 1, 2019, as Chancellor-elect, and began as Chancellor on June 1, 2019./nSince his tenure at Washington University in St. Louis began, Martin has positioned three strategic pillars at the forefront of his vision: academic distinction, educational access, and the university\u2019s role and impact \u201cin St. Louis and for St. Louis.\u201d[4]/nMuch of Martin's early chancellorship has been defined by the onset of COVID-19 and the university's operational and financial response.[5][6] Notably, under Martin's leadership, the university was one of the first in the Midwest region to announce a residential campus shutdown and remote working operations, a decision that came ahead of local and state decisions to enforce similar restrictions. In addition, Washington University was one of the only higher education institutions in the United States to announce a delayed start, rather than an accelerated start, to the 2020 fall and 2021 spring academic terms and one of the first to reinstate retirement benefits and the university's salary merit increase program after the majority of institutions and organizations made similar budget cuts. During that time, scientists at the School of Medicine's McDonnell Genome Institute developed a saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostic test that is simple, fast, economical, and able to be utilized at a massive scale for screening and diagnostic testing.[7]/nIn February 2019, one of Martin's first announcements as Chancellor of Washington University was the creation of the university's Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity, and Equity (CRE2).[8] CRE2 officially launched in August 2020 and utilizes field-defining research, innovative learning, and strategic engagement in order to transform scholarship, policy, and clinical interventions where race and ethnicity are at the center.[9]/nDuring his inauguration on October 3, 2019, Martin announced the WashU Pledge, a financial aid program that provides a free undergraduate education to incoming, full-time Missouri and southern Illinois students who are Pell Grant eligible or from families with annual incomes of $75,000 or less. The WashU Pledge covers the full cost of a Washington University education, including tuition, room, board and fees.[10]/nIn June 2020, Martin outlined a set of action steps to address issues of racial equity on Washington University's campus and throughout the St. Louis region, including the creation of an Equity and Inclusion Council, the hiring of 12 new faculty with a research emphasis on race, enhanced pedagogy and curricular programming, collaborative efforts to reimagine the university's police force and campus safety, increased supplier diversity in contracting and construction projects, and more.[11]/nIn October 2021, Martin announced Gateway to Success, a $1 billion investment in financial aid that enabled the university to adopt a need-blind undergraduate admission process effective immediately. The investment was made possible largely as a result of an extraordinary 65% return on the university\u2019s Managed Endowment Pool for the 2020-21 fiscal year. Martin said of the initiative at the time of its announcement, \u201cSince I became chancellor nearly two years ago, becoming need-blind has been a top priority. Building on the momentum that began with our previous administration, we\u2019re finally making it happen. This is a proud moment for us as an institution and I\u2019m grateful to all who have contributed along the way, including generous donors who have provided scholarships and other financial support for our students.\u201d/nIn October 2022, Martin and Provost Beverly Wendland launched Here and Next, the University\u2019s globally informed, community-driven strategic vision for academic distinction. The plan aims to mobilize research, education, and patient care to establish Washington University and St. Louis as global hubs for transformative solutions to the deepest societal challenges. More than 2,000 stakeholders contributed to the plan, which is built on the guiding principles of academic distinction; community impact; equity, diversity, and inclusion; global perspective; and stewardship./nIn order to advance Martin\u2019s vision for Washington University to be the most supportive campus for students in higher ed, in October 2022 he launched Make Way: Our Student Initiative, a bold fundraising campaign that removes barriers to success for today\u2019s diverse student population in order to cultivate a culture of equity, success, leadership, physical and mental health, civic engagement, career preparation, and financial support./nAlong with numerous scholarly articles and book chapters, Martin is the author of \u201cAn Introduction to Empirical Legal Research,\u201d which he co-authored with Lee Epstein, the Ethan A.H. Shepley Distinguished University Professor at Washington University,[12] along with \u201cJudicial Decision-Making: A Coursebook,\u201d which he co-authored with Barry Friedman et al.[13] Throughout his career, Martin has received research funding from many organizations, including Andrew W.

She taught there until she resigned mid-semester in October 1927.[6] That winter she moved to Connecticut where she was one of the first seven professors \u2014 and the first mathematics professor \u2014 at the Junior College of Connecticut (now the University of Bridgeport), which opened in February 1928.[7] After a year and a half, she moved to Oneonta, New York, where she was a mathematics professor and the advisor for women at Hartwick College.[8]/nThe following year she moved to Columbia, Missouri, where her brother Leonard Haseman was the chair of the entomology department at the University of Missouri.[9] In 1936, she returned to Linton, Indiana, where she remained until 1979 when she passed away at 90 years old.[8]/nHaseman was an early contributor to the mathematical field of knot theory and in particular to the study of achiral knots. In knot theory a knot is called chiral if it is not equivalent to its mirror image, otherwise it is achiral (or amphicheiral). Prior to Haseman's investigations, the Scottish mathematician and physicist Peter Guthrie Tait had found all prime achiral knots with 10 or fewer crossings. Tait conjectured that all achiral knots (or perhaps all alternating achiral knots) had to have an even crossing number.[10] (This turned out to be true for alternating knots,[11] but in 1998, Jim Hoste, Morwen Thistlethwaite, and Jeff Weeks discovered a 15-crossing nonalternating achiral knot.[12]) In her graduate studies Haseman looked for achiral knots having more than 10 crossings. Her work during this period lead to her PhD thesis, \"On knots with a census of the amphicheirals with twelve crossings,\" and two articles published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, one in 1918[13] and one in 1920.[14] In the first article she presented all 54 prime achiral knots with 12 crossings and seven more that were duplicates.[15] She also found many additional achiral knots with 14 crossings./nHaseman's work marked the end of the exploratory, intuition-based phase of knot theory began by Peter Gutrie Tait. Studying knots by hand was getting ever more challenging, as the numbers of knots with each crossing number increased quickly. Also, by the time of Haseman's thesis, other mathematicians were beginning to apply the new, more technical topological tools to the study of knots./nMorwen Thistlethwaite wrote, \"The modern knot tabulator must be indebted to these three [ Thomas Kirkman, Peter Guthrie Tait, and Charles Newton Little ], and also to Mary Haseman, who ventured courageously into the hitherto uncharted regions of 12-crossing knots.\"[16] Hongler and Weber conclude their article about Tait's and Haseman's work on achiral knots with, \"Finally, let us raise high our hat to the remarkable exploration work done by Tait and Haseman.

The largest of the ship's boats, the James Caird, in which six of Endurance's crew made their epic small-boat voyage of 700 nautical miles (1,300\u00a0km, 810 statute miles) from Elephant Island to South Georgia, was named in appreciation of Caird's contribution. Caird himself died two months prior to Shackleton's arrival at Stromness, South Georgia. Thus, Caird died without ever learning of the successful rescue of Endurance's personnel whom he helped financing./nCaird was awarded an honorary degree from the University of St. Andrews./nCaird died at his Perthshire estate, Belmont Castle near Meigle, which he had purchased after the death of its previous owner Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.[4] The baronetcy became extinct upon his death. He is buried with his father in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh just west of the central roundel, under a modest stone.[citation needed].", "197030": "Pierre Gassendi (French: [pj\u025b\u0281 gas\u025b\u0303di];[5] also Pierre Gassend, Petrus Gassendi, Petrus Gassendus; 22 January 1592 \u2013 24 October 1655) was a French philosopher, Catholic priest, astronomer, and mathematician.[1][6][7] While he held a church position in south-east France, he also spent much time in Paris, where he was a leader of a group of free-thinking intellectuals. He was also an active observational scientist, publishing the first data on the transit of Mercury in 1631. The lunar crater Gassendi is named after him./nHe wrote numerous philosophical works, and some of the positions he worked out are considered significant, finding a way between skepticism and dogmatism. Richard Popkin indicates that Gassendi was one of the first thinkers to formulate the modern \"scientific outlook\", of moderated skepticism and empiricism. He clashed with his contemporary Descartes on the possibility of certain knowledge. His best known intellectual project attempted to reconcile Epicurean atomism with Christianity./nGassendi was born at Champtercier, near Digne, in France to Antoine Gassend and Fran\u00e7oise Fabry.[8] His earliest education was entrusted to his maternal uncle, Thomas Fabry, the cur\u00e9 of the church of Champtercier.[9]  A youthful prodigy, at a very early age he showed academic potential and attended the coll\u00e8ge (the town high school) at Digne, where he displayed a particular aptitude for languages and mathematics. In 1609 he entered the University of Aix-en-Provence, to study philosophy under Philibert Fesaye, O.Carm.[10] at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal de Bourbon (the Faculty of Arts of the University of Aix).[11] In 1612 the college of Digne called him to lecture on theology. While at Digne, he travelled to Senez, where he received minor orders from Bishop Jacques Martin. In 1614 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Avignon,[12] and was elected Theologian in the Cathedral Chapter of Digne. On 1 August 1617 he received holy orders from Bishop Jacques Turricella of Marseille.[9] In the same year, at the age of 24, he accepted the chair of philosophy at the University of Aix-en-Provence, and yielded the chair of theology to his old teacher, Fesaye. Gassendi seems gradually to have withdrawn from theology. He maintained his position as Canon Theologian at Digne, however, and in September 1619, when Bishop Rapha\u00ebl de Bologne took possession of the diocese of Digne, Gassendi participated and made the speech on behalf of the Chapter.[13]/nHe lectured principally on the Aristotelian philosophy, conforming as far as possible to the traditional methods while he also followed with interest the discoveries of Galileo and Kepler. He came into contact with the astronomer Joseph Gaultier de la Vallette (1564\u20131647), the Grand Vicar of the Archbishopric of Aix.[14]/nIn 1623 the Society of Jesus took over the University of Aix. They filled all positions with Jesuits, so Gassendi was required to find another institution.[15] He left, returning to Digne on 10 February 1623, and then returned to Aix to witness an eclipse of the moon on 14 April and the presence of Mars in Sagittarius on 7 June, from which he returned again to Digne.[16] He travelled to Grenoble on behalf of the Chapter of Digne for a lawsuit, most reluctantly, since he was working on his project on Aristotle's paradoxes.[17] In 1624 he printed the first part of his Exercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristoteleos.  A fragment of the second book later appeared in print at The Hague (1659), but Gassendi never composed the remaining five, apparently thinking that the Discussiones Peripateticae of Francesco Patrizzi left little scope for him./nHe spent some time with his patron Nicolas Peiresc. After 1628 Gassendi travelled in Flanders and in Holland where he encountered Isaac Beeckman and Fran\u00e7ois Luillier.[17][18] He returned to France in 1631. In 1634 the Cathedral Chapter of Digne had become disgusted at the wasteful behavior of Provost Blaise Ausset, and they voted to replace him. They obtained an arr\u00eat of the Parliament of Aix, dated 19 December 1634, which consented to his deposition and to the election of Gassendi as provost of the Cathedral Chapter. Gassendi was formally installed on 24 December 1634. He held the Provostship until his death in 1655.[19]/nDuring this time he wrote some works, at the insistence of Marin Mersenne. They included his examination of the mystical philosophy of Robert Fludd,[20] an essay on parhelia,[21] and some observations on the transit of Mercury./nGassendi then spent some years travelling through Provence with the duke of Angoul\u00eame, governor of the region. During this period he wrote only the one literary work, his Life of Peiresc, whose death in 1637 seemed to afflict him deeply;[22] it received frequent reprintings and an English translation. He returned to Paris in 1641, where he met Thomas Hobbes.[23] He gave some informal philosophy classes, gaining pupils or disciples; according to the biographer Grimarest, these included Moli\u00e8re, Cyrano de Bergerac (whose participation in classes is disputed),[24] Jean Hesnault and Claude-Emmanuel Chapelle, son of Lullier.[25][26]/nIn 1640 Mersenne engaged him in controversy with Ren\u00e9 Descartes. His objections to the fundamental propositions of Descartes appeared in print in 1641; they appear as the Fifth Set of Objections in the works of Descartes[27] and as a separate edition entitled Disquisitio Metaphysica[28] with rejoinders.[29] Though Descartes is often credited with the discovery of the mind-body problem, Gassendi, reacting to Descartes' mind-body dualism, was the first to state it.[30] Gassendi's tendency towards the empirical school of speculation appears more pronounced here than in any of his other writings. Jean-Baptiste Morin attacked his De motu impresso a motore translato (1642).[22] In 1643 Mersenne also tried to garner support from the German Socinian and advocate of religious tolerance Marcin Ruar. Ruar replied at length that he had already read Gassendi but was in favour of leaving science to science not to the church.[31]/nIn 1645 he accepted the chair of mathematics in the Coll\u00e8ge Royal in Paris, and lectured for several years with great success. In addition to controversial writings on physical questions, there appeared during this period the first of the works for which historians of philosophy remember him. In 1647 he published the well-received treatise De vita, moribus, et doctrina Epicuri libri octo. Two years later appeared his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes La\u00ebrtius.[32] In the same year he had published the more important commentary Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri.[33]/nIn 1648 ill-health compelled him to give up his lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal. Around this time he became reconciled to Descartes, after years of coldness, through the good offices of C\u00e9sar d'Estr\u00e9es.[34]/nHe travelled in the south of France, in the company of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, aide and secretary Fran\u00e7ois Bernier, another pupil from Paris. He spent nearly two years at Toulon,  where the climate suited him. In 1653 he returned to Paris and resumed his literary work, living in the house of Montmor, publishing in that year lives of Copernicus and of Tycho Brahe. The disease from which he suffered, a lung complaint, had, however, established a firm hold on him. His strength gradually failed, and he died at Paris in 1655. A bronze statue of him (by Joseph Ramus) was erected by subscription at Digne in 1852. \nA large crater on the Moon is named after him.[35]/nAs part of his promotion of empirical methods and his anti-Aristotelian and anti-Cartesian views, he was responsible for a number of scientific 'firsts':/nIn addition to this he did work on determining longitude via eclipses of the Moon and on improving the Rudolphine Tables. He addressed the issue of free fall in De motu (1642) and De proportione qua gravia decidentia accelerantur (1646).[36]/nEdward Gibbon styled him \"Le meilleur philosophe des litt\u00e9rateurs, et le meilleur litt\u00e9rateur des philosophes\" (The greatest philosopher among literary men, and the greatest literary man among philosophers)./nHenri Louis Habert de Montmor published Gassendi's collected works, most importantly the Syntagma philosophicum (Opera, i. and ii.), in 1658 (6 vols., Lyons). Nicolaus Averanius published another edition, also in 6 folio volumes, in 1727. The first two comprise entirely his Syntagma philosophicum; the third contains his critical writings on Epicurus, Aristotle, Descartes, Robert Fludd and Herbert of Cherbury, with some occasional pieces on certain problems of physics; the fourth, his Institutio astronomica, and his Commentarii de rebus celestibus; the fifth, his commentary on the tenth book of Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the biographies of Epicurus, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, Tycho Brahe, Nicolaus Copernicus, Georg von Peuerbach, and Regiomontanus, with some tracts on the value of ancient money, on the Roman calendar, and on the theory of music, with an appended large and prolix piece entitled Notitia ecclesiae Diniensis; the sixth volume contains his correspondence. The Lives, especially those of Copernicus, Tycho and Peiresc, received much praise./nThe Exercitationes excited much attention, though they contain little or nothing beyond what others had already advanced against Aristotle. The first book expounds clearly, and with much vigour, the evil effects of the blind acceptance of the Aristotelian dicta on physical and philosophical study; but, as occurs with so many of the anti-Aristotelian works of this period, the objections show the usual ignorance of Aristotle's own writings[citation needed]. The second book, which contains the review of Aristotle's dialectic or logic, throughout reflects Ramism in tone and method. One of the objections to Descartes became famous through Descartes's statement of it in the appendix of objections in the Meditations./nHis book Animadversiones, published in 1649, contains a translation of Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Book X on Epicurus, and appeared with a commentary, in the form of the Syntagma philosophiae Epicuri.[36] His labors on Epicurus have historical importance, but he has been criticized for holding doctrines arguably irreconcilable with his strong expressions of empiricism./nIn the book, he maintains his maxim \"that there is nothing in the intellect which has not been in the senses\" (nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu), but he contends that the imaginative faculty (phantasia) is the counterpart of sense, because it involves material images, and therefore is intrinsically material, and that it is essentially the same both in men and brutes. However, he also admits that the classic qualifier of humanity, intellect, which he affirms as immaterial and immortal, comes to an understanding of notions and truths that no effort of sensation or imagination could have attained (Op. ii. 383). He illustrates the capacity to form \"general notions\"; the conception of universality (ib. 384), which he says brutes never are able to partake in, though they utilize phantasia as truly as men; the notion of God, whom he says we may imagine as corporeal, but understand as incorporeal; and lastly, the reflex by which the mind makes the phenomena and operations within it the objects of its attention./nThe English Epicurean Walter Charleton produced an English free adaptation of this book, Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charletonia, in 1654.[36]/nThe Syntagma philosophicum sub-divides, according to the usual fashion of the Epicureans, into logic (which, with Gassendi as with Epicurus, is truly canonic), physics and ethics./nThe logic contains a sketch of the history of the science De origine et varietate logicae, and is divided into theory of right apprehension (bene imaginari), theory of right judgment (bene proponere), theory of right inference (bene colligere), theory of right method (bene ordinare). The first part contains the specially empirical positions which Gassendi afterwards neglects or leaves out of account. The senses, the sole source of knowledge, supposedly yield us immediate cognition of individual things; phantasy (which Gassendi takes as material in nature) reproduces these ideas; understanding compares these ideas, each particular, and frames general ideas. Nevertheless, he admits that the senses yield knowledge\u2014not of things\u2014but of qualities only, and that we arrive at the idea of thing or substance by inductive reasoning. He holds that the true method of research is the analytic, rising from lower to higher notions; yet he sees and admits that inductive reasoning, as conceived by Francis Bacon, rests on a general proposition not itself proved by induction.  The whole doctrine of judgment, syllogism and method mixes Aristotelian and Ramist notions./nIn the second part of the Syntagma, the physics, appears the most glaring contradiction between Gassendi's fundamental principles. While approving of the Epicurean physics, he rejects the Epicurean negation of God and particular providence. He states the various proofs for the existence of an immaterial, infinite, supreme Being, asserts that this Being is the author of the visible universe, and strongly defends the doctrine of the foreknowledge and particular providence of God. At the same time he holds, in opposition to Epicureanism, the doctrine of an immaterial rational soul, endowed with immortality and capable of free determination. Friedrich Albert Lange[37] claimed that all this portion of Gassendi's system contains nothing of his own opinions, but is introduced solely from motives of self-defence./nThe positive exposition of atomism has much that is attractive, but the hypothesis of the calor vitalis (vital heat), a species of anima mundi (world-soul) which he introduces as a physical explanation of physical phenomena, does not seem to throw much light on the special problems which  he invokes it to solve. Nor is his theory of the weight essential to atoms as being due to an inner force impelling them to motion in any way reconcilable with his general doctrine of mechanical causes./nIn the third part, the ethics, over and above the discussion on freedom, which on the whole is indefinite, there is little beyond a milder statement of the Epicurean moral code. The final end of life is happiness, and happiness is harmony of soul and body (tranquillitas animi et indolentia corporis). Probably, Gassendi thinks, perfect happiness is not attainable in this life, but it may be in the life to come./nAccording to Gabriel Daniel, Gassendi was a little Pyrrhonian in matters of science; but that was no bad thing.[38] He wrote against the magical animism of Robert Fludd, and judicial astrology.[39][40] He became dissatisfied with the Peripatetic system, the orthodox approach to natural philosophy based on the writings of Aristotle. Gassendi shared an empirical tendency of the age. He contributed to the objections against Aristotelian philosophy, but waited to publish his own thoughts./nThere remains some controversy as to the extent to which Gassendi subscribed to the so-called libertinage \u00e9rudit, the learned free-thinking that characterised the T\u00e9trade, the Parisian circle to which he belonged, along with Gabriel Naud\u00e9 and two others (\u00c9lie Diodati and Fran\u00e7ois de La Mothe Le Vayer). Gassendi, at least, belonged to the fideist wing of the sceptics, arguing that the absence of certain knowledge implied the room for faith.[41]/nIn his dispute with Descartes he did apparently hold that the evidence of the senses remains the only convincing evidence; yet he maintains, as is natural from his mathematical training, that the evidence of reason is absolutely satisfactory./nSamuel Sorbi\u00e8re, a disciple,[42] recounts Gassendi's life in the first collected edition of the works, by Joseph Bougerel, Vie de Gassendi (1737; 2nd ed., 1770); as does Jean Philibert Damiron, M\u00e9moire sur Gassendi (1839). An abridgment of his philosophy was given by his friend, the celebrated traveller, Fran\u00e7ois Bernier (Abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de la philosophie de Gassendi, 8 vols., 1678; 2nd ed., 7 vols., 1684).", "49217960": "Thomas Hans Willwacher (born 12 April 1983) is a German mathematician and mathematical physicist working as a Professor at the Institute of Mathematics, ETH Zurich.[1]/nWillwacher completed his PhD at ETH Zurich in 2009 with a thesis on \"Cyclic Formality\", under the supervision of Giovanni Felder, Alberto Cattaneo, and Anton Alekseev.[2] He was later a Junior member of the Harvard Society of Fellows./nIn July 2016 Willwacher was awarded a prize from the European Mathematical Society for \"his striking and important research in a variety of mathematical fields: homotopical algebra, geometry, topology and mathematical physics, including deep results related to Kontsevich's formality theorem and the relation between Kontsevich's graph complex and the Grothendieck-Teichm\u00fcller Lie algebra\".[3][4]/nNotable results of Willwacher include the proof of Maxim Kontsevich's cyclic formality conjecture and the proof that the Grothendieck\u2013Teichm\u00fcller Lie algebra is isomorphic to the degree zero cohomology of Kontsevich's graph complex./n/nThis article about a German mathematician is a stub.

In 1903 she was the first woman to have a paper published by the Physical Society of London.[1] She also contributed to the fields of optics and early television.[3][4][5]/nAlice Everett was born at 105 Douglas Street in  Glasgow on 15 May 1865 to Jessie (n\u00e9e Fraser) (1841-1924) and Joseph David Everett, FRS. She had five siblings and the family moved to Belfast when she was two when her father was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Queen's University, Belfast.[6] Her father would remain in the post until his retirement thirty years later in 1897. Everett was educated at the Methodist College Belfast, where she was a prize winning pupil.[3]/nAt this time, the sole means of access to a university education in Ireland for women was through the Royal University of Ireland, which awarded degrees solely through examination. In 1882 Queen's College, Belfast began accepting female students, allowing them to take lectures in preparation for the Royal University examinations.[7] Everett applied for this option and in 1884 she was awarded first place in the first-year science examinations but the college refused to grant the scholarship to a woman.[8] In 1886 Everett moved to the all-women's college Girton College, Cambridge. In 1887 she sat the Royal University of Ireland examination for mathematics and mathematical physics, passed with honours, and was awarded a bachelor's degree. She was awarded a Master of Arts in 1889 by the same university. Also in 1889, she passed the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge University. Female students were permitted to sit the examinations but the university would not grant degrees to female students until 1928. 1889 marked the end of Everett's university education and the beginning of a ground-breaking career in astronomy.[3]/nThe UK Civil Service rules that applied at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich made the employment of women very difficult.[9] However, in 1890 William Christie, the Astronomer Royal, was interested in employing some the highly educated women that began graduating from English universities. He got round the regulation by paying women as supernumerary computers and not putting them on the permanent payroll. He employed four women, not as supernumerary computers but as second assistants who undertook both observations and computing. Among others he hired Everett,[10] who became the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory, Greenwich when she began working in January 1890. At Greenwich, Everett was assigned to work in the Astrographic Department, contributing to the international Carte du Ciel star mapping project. In addition to her work as a computer, Everett was trained to use the Observatory's new astrographic telescope (installed in 1890) to take the photographs. Everett's job also involved measuring the plates, calculating the co-ordinates of the stars, and reducing the data for the catalogue. During this time, Everett also made observations for the Transit Department with the Prime-Meridian-defining Airy Transit Circle.[11]/nIn 1891 Everett persuaded her friend Annie Russell to apply to work at the Royal Observatory and in September Russell began work at the observatory. She had attended Girton College with Everett and the two had sat and passed the difficult Tripos examination together.[12] In 1892 Everett, Russell and Elizabeth Brown tried to get elected for fellowship at the Royal Astronomical Society. None of the women was admitted, because all fell short of the required votes.[13] Similarly, the nomination of Isis Pogson had been rejected in 1886.[14] So instead they joined and actively contributed to the amateur British Astronomical Association (BAA).[15] Everett would publish her work in the BAA's Journal, The Observatory, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and elsewhere.[16]/nAfter five years at Greenwich, Everett became tired of the low salary and began looking for work elsewhere. She failed to get a position at the Dunsink Observatory, Dublin, and instead obtained a three-year temporary post at the Astrophysical Observatory of Potsdam, then Europe's leading institution for astrophysical research. Everett began working at the observatory as a scientific assistant in October 1895, becoming the first woman to work in an observatory in Germany. She continued to work on the Carte du Ciel project.[11] During her time in Potsdam she measured stars on photographic chart-plates and in one year, 1897, helped measure the positions of 22,000 stars.[11] She left Potsdam July 1899.[17] Everett moved for a one-year post at the observatory of Vassar College in the United States where she wrote two papers with Mary Whitney. James Keeler, director of the Lick Observatory had hoped to hire her for the spectroscopic programme at the observatory but was unable to obtain funds. Instead Everett would return to London in 1900 where her interests turned from astronomy to the related field of optics. Her astronomical career came to an end at the age of 35.[11]/nEverett's interest in optics had been sparked when she assisted her retired father in translating an article in German on Jena optical glass. She would assist her father with his research and experiments in optics until his death in 1904. In 1903 her father communicated a paper by her to the Physical Society of London describing experiments on zonal observations in lenses, the first paper by a woman to appear in the society's journal.[11] However opportunities for women in this field of science (or indeed any field of science) were few. As a result, Everett would be unable to find regular paid work until the First World War, which gave many women an opportunity to enter the workforce. In 1917 and at the age of fifty-two, Everett joined the staff of the National Physical Laboratory. Everett worked in the optics section until she reached the age of retirement (60) in 1925.[11]/nRetirement would mark the third strand of Everett's technical career, engineering. In the late 1920s Everett would take and pass examinations in wireless and electrical engineering. Everett also developed an interest in the new field of television and may have been one of two women present at the demonstration of the first television image by John Logie Baird in January 1926.  As a result, Everett would become one of the founding members and Fellows of the newly established Television Society (now Royal Television Society) in September 1927.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Everett would become involved with the Baird Television Company and Television Society and in 1933 the two would apply for a joint patent relating to television optics.  Everett would continue contribution to the field of television for the rest of her life. In recognition of her contribution to the field of physics, she was granted a civil list pension of \u00a3100 in 1938. On 21 July 1949, she died in London and would leave her library of scientific books to the Television Society.[1][11]", "71795180": "Alison Sarah Tomlin is a British physical chemist and applied mathematician whose research involves building detailed mathematical models of combustion, including uncertainty quantification for those models.

Initially he worked on modelling the housing market,[10] but switched to housing policy in 1982. He was one of the first CSIRO scientists to apply for government projects at open tender, and subsequently won nearly 50 research projects on his own behalf or leading teams. His first project, with SIROMATH,[11] examined the employment created by housing construction and the market-purchase of public housing, using multi-regional input-output analysis.[12] The study showed that housing had the best employment multiplier of any industry sector, because of a high labour component and relatively few imports.[13] It was used by advocates to promote spending on public housing./nHis most influential project was the 1986 Housing Subsidy Study[14] with Judith Yates, which enumerated about 200 Federal and State housing subsidy programmes in Australia. The study showed the subsidy system was unfairly distributed towards higher income earners and home owners, while private renters were receiving almost no support from government.[15] Through the Cass Review, the Australian government then radically expanded Rent Assistance to low income renters.[16] Rent assistance became after the mid-1990s Australia's largest housing subsidy program, with an annual expenditure of over AU$5 billion in 2022.[17]/nIn 1988, Flood wrote several reports for the National Housing Policy Review.[18] Up until that time public housing in Australia had been funded by loans from the Commonwealth. He pointed out this was not viable as tenants now had insufficient incomes to meet even basic operating costs and had no money for interest payments. The Commonwealth immediately converted all funding from loans to grants.[19]/nIn 1992, Flood won a large Commonwealth project to examine changes in internal migration.[20] He found that employment had become a much smaller determinant of migration decisions than in the past, and quality of life had become much more important.[21] With John Roy, he constructed an advanced model of internal migration./nFlood completed other studies in piggery buildings,[22] optimal replacement,[23] industrial location[24] and urban exports.[25] He wrote the first Australian papers on the anticipated effects of climate change on urban areas.[26]/nHe also provided input to several government inquiries during the period, assisting the House of Representatives[27] and the Productivity Commission.[28] In 1991 he was CSIRO's representative on the Prime Minister's Economically Sustainable Development Task Force (Transport).[29]/nBy 1993 he was a Principal Research Scientist and leader of housing research at CSIRO. With university partners he won a tender to establish the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, and he was appointed as Associate Director and the director of housing research.[30]/nFlood became interested in organisation theory and science policy in 1982, and wrote on the changing structure of CSIRO.[31] He became an official of the CSIRO Officer's Association[32] from 1984 to 1993, during crucial battles for science funding and reorganisation. He was elected national Vice-president of the CSIRO Staff Association in 1993. He was also President of the Australian Council of Professional Associations[33] for several years./nHe extended his industrial democracy work with CSIRO to a general participatory framework for indicators development,[34] which he explored in 1992 during the National Housing Strategy.[35] He used this system worldwide to develop policy indicators of different kinds, leading to a change in career./nIn 1993, Flood was offered the position of inaugural Co-ordinator of the Indicators Programme at UN-Habitat in Nairobi. From 1994 to 1996, the programme developed a comprehensive series of urban indicators covering a range of pro-poor local issues - social outcomes, poverty measurement, infrastructure, housing and governance.[36] The indicators presented an overview of progress in achieving the aims of the Habitat Agenda for the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul. The indicators were then collected in 1995-6 and in 1999 for more than 250 cities, with an emphasis on Africa.[37][38] At the end of his tenure, the Global Urban Observatory network was established through a resolution of the Commission on Human Settlements.[39]/nReturning to Melbourne in 1996, he analysed the Urban Indicators data.[40][41] He discovered that much of the variation in the data could be explained by a single index, the City Development Index, which is strongly associated with the level of development of a city./nFrom 2001 to 2006 Flood advised on the establishment of Local Urban Observatories in Ethiopia, Yemen, South Africa, Mexico and Iran.The most successful of these has been in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia, which was designed by Flood with the support of UNDP, It has extended to a network responsible for monitoring the Hajj pilgrimage.[42][43]/nIn 2000-01, Flood managed two large commercial projects on local governance in the Philippines.[44][45]/nIn 2003 he edited and partly authored the flagship UN report The Challenge of Slums,[46] which contained a detailed global analysis of the situation in informal and low-income settlements. In 2004 he estimated the worldwide cost of upgrading slums at $200 billion for the UN Millennium Project.[47]/nFlood continued to work intermittently with UN-Habitat. In 2012, as part of a review of the Global Shelter Strategy, he examined the housing situation across the Pacific,[48] including Australia and New Zealand.[49] He developed a National Housing Strategy for Myanmar in 2017.[50]/nIn Australia from 1996 to 2010, Flood's work included institutional lending models,[51] maintenance in indigenous housing,[52] asset management,[53] factorial ecology,[54] and multinomial analysis of large housing surveys. In 2010 he re-visited work of Yates showing that home ownership continued to fall among younger households in Australia.[55]/nFrom 2015 to 2017 Flood was Research and Policy Adviser for Community Housing Limited,[56] where he worked on an affordable housing project for Rwanda; the wind-down of the National Rental Affordability Scheme;[57] alternative home ownership arrangements; homelessness policy;[58] transitional housing;[59] a furniture industry for Timor Leste; and active management of the housing stock.[60]/nFlood has co-ordinated a large international Cornwall DNA group since 2011.[61] He has written a book on Cornwall's history and the Cornish people.[62] He gives talks and courses on DNA,[1] and has written a number of articles on genetic genealogy.[63]/nFlood has been critical of Australia's housing policy. In 1986, he showed that the popular federal program, the First Home Owner's Scheme (FHOS), was counterproductive unless it was restricted to lower income earners,[64] and might result in house price rises in excess of the amount given as a subsidy to home purchasers. Nevertheless, FHOS continued after 2000 and prices rose more strongly than ever.[65]/nIn 2004 he became alarmed when the median house price to income ratio rose sharply in Australia, along with overcrowding indicators, while the rate of home ownership began to fall. Initially he attributed this to the increased availability of housing loans to landlords, who were outbidding first home buyers while writing off their mortgage costs against other income.[66] Later he considered that falling global finance costs, and rapid immigration without the necessary supporting infrastructure spending, were also to blame. The practice of charging the costs of infrastructure to developers was also leading to steep residential land price rises in some States.[67] In 2010 he completed an AHURI study[55] showing home ownership was decreasing sharply among younger households.[68]  He stated,\" The country that promised limitless land, cheap housing and near-universal home ownership to all comers now has some of the most expensive housing in the world.\"[69] He was the subject of a flurry of media attention in South Australia, who were desperate to know if he was forecasting an imminent house price collapse.[70][71]/nFlood was married to arts educator and artist Adele Flood[72] from 1972 to 2009, and they had three sons Benjamin, Daniel and Matthew./nHe had a fourth son, Nathaniel Cervas, in the Philippines in 2002.

He was descended from Atherton Mather (1663\u20131734), a cousin of Cotton Mather.  His early work dealt with the stability of smooth mappings between smooth manifolds of dimensions n (for the source manifold N) and p (for the target manifold P). He determined the precise dimensions (n,p) for which smooth mappings are stable with respect to smooth equivalence by diffeomorphisms of the source and target (i.e., infinitely differentiable coordinate changes).[1]/nMather also proved the conjecture of the French topologist Ren\u00e9 Thom that under topological equivalence smooth mappings are generically stable: the subset of the space of smooth mappings between two smooth manifolds consisting of the topologically stable mappings is a dense subset in the smooth Whitney topology. His notes on the topic of topological stability are still a standard reference on the topic of topologically stratified spaces.[2]/nIn the 1970s, Mather switched to the field of dynamical systems. He made the following main contributions to dynamical systems that deeply influenced the field./n1. He introduced the concept of Mather spectrum and gave a characterization of Anosov diffeomorphisms.[3]/n2. Jointly with Richard McGehee, he gave an example of collinear four-body problem which has initial conditions leading to solutions that blow up in finite time. This was the first result that made the Painlev\u00e9 conjecture plausible.[4]/n3. He developed a variational theory for the globally action minimizing orbits for twist maps (convex Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of freedom), along the line of the work of George David Birkhoff, Marston Morse, Gustav A. Hedlund, et al. This theory is now known as Aubry\u2013Mather theory.[5][6]/n4. He developed the Aubry\u2013Mather theory in higher dimensions, a theory which is now called Mather theory.[7][8][9] This theory turned out to be deeply related to the viscosity solution theory of Michael G. Crandall, Pierre-Louis Lions et al. for Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation. The link was revealed in the weak KAM theory of Albert Fathi.[10]/n5. He announced a proof of Arnold diffusion for nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of freedom.[11] He prepared the technique, formulated a proper concept of genericity and made some important progresses towards its solution./n6. In a series of papers,[12][13] he proved that for certain regularity r, depending on the dimension of the smooth manifold M,  the group Diff(M, r) is perfect, i.e. equal to its own commutator subgroup, where Diff(M, r) is the group of C^r diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold M that are isotopic to the identity through a compactly supported C^r isotopy.

In hydraulic engineering, he is often credited improperly for the application of the momentum principle to a hydraulic jump in a rectangular open channel in 1828. His true contribution in 1828 was the development of the backwater equation for gradually varied flows in open channels (B\u00e9langer 1828) and the application of the momentum principle to the hydraulic jump flow in 1838. (B\u00e9langer 1841)/nBorn in Valenciennes on 4 April 1790, B\u00e9langer was the son of Charles Antoine Aim\u00e9 Joseph B\u00e9langer, master locksmith, and of Jeanne Fran\u00e7oise Joseph.

These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:/nGo, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides; \nGo measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; \nInstruct the planets in what orbs to run,/nCorrect old Time, and regulate the sun;/nThomson became intrigued with Fourier's Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur and committed himself to study the \"Continental\" mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir Isaac Newton. Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, Philip Kelland authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published scientific paper[16] under the pseudonym P.Q.R., defending Fourier, and submitted to the Cambridge Mathematical Journal by his father. A second P.Q.R. paper followed almost immediately.[17]/nWhile on holiday with his family in Lamlash in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial P.Q.R. paper On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity.[18] In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of heat conduction and electrostatics, an analogy that James Clerk Maxwell was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable science-forming ideas.[19]/nWilliam's father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.[20] He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of mathematics, physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler.[21] He also won the First Smith's Prize, which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\"[22]/nIn 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of Michael Faraday's idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \"dielectric\", and not by some incomprehensible \"action at a distance\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related./nHe was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845.[23] On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated Henri Victor Regnault, at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before./nBy 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in Oxford. At that meeting, he heard James Prescott Joule making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the caloric theory of heat and the theory of the heat engine built upon it by Sadi Carnot and \u00c9mile Clapeyron. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and mechanical work and for their mechanical equivalence./nThomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron school. He predicted that the melting point of ice must fall with pressure, otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a perpetuum mobile. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs./nIn 1848, he extended the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the gas thermometer provided only an operational definition of temperature. He proposed an absolute temperature scale[24] in which \"a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature T\u00b0 of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (T\u22121)\u00b0, would give out the same mechanical effect [work], whatever be the number T.\" Such a scale would be \"quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.\"[25] By employing such a \"waterfall\", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of absolute zero about which Guillaume Amontons had speculated in 1702. \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat\", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used \u2212267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature. Thomson used data published by Regnault to calibrate his scale against established measurements./nIn his publication, Thomson wrote:/n... The conversion of heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered/n\u2014But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's very remarkable discoveries. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views./nThomson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1849,[26] still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the second law of thermodynamics. In Carnot's theory, lost heat was absolutely lost but Thomson contended that it was \"lost to man irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world\". Moreover, his theological beliefs led Thomson to extrapolate the second law to the cosmos, originating the idea of universal heat death./nI believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on \u2013 I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing vis viva which is converted into heat; and that although some vis viva may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be precisely compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.[27]/nCompensation would require a creative act or an act possessing similar power,[27] resulting in a rejuvenating universe (as Thomson had previously compared universal heat death to a clock running slower and slower, although he was unsure whether it would eventually reach thermodynamic equilibrium and stop for ever).[28] Kelvin also formulated the heat death paradox (Kelvin's paradox) in 1862, which uses the second law of thermodynamics to disprove the possibility of an infinitely old universe; this paradox was later extended by Rankine.[29]/nIn final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared \"the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.\"[30] Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:/nIt is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.[31]/nIn the paper, Thomson supported the theory that heat was a form of motion but admitted that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir Humphry Davy and the experiments of Joule and Julius Robert von Mayer, maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding.[32]/nAs soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the Joule\u2013Thomson effect, sometimes called the Kelvin\u2013Joule effect, and the published results[33] did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the kinetic theory./nThomson published more than 650 scientific papers[2] and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued). Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:/nIn physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.[34]/nThough now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum;[7] but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next 17 years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable./nFaraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent \u2013 in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month.[35] He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis,[36] Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability./nThomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible\"./nThomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular Athenaeum magazine,[37] pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company./nThomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir Charles Tilston Bright as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the specification, supported by Faraday and Samuel F. B. Morse./nThomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship HMS\u00a0Agamemnon in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after 380 miles (610\u00a0km) when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the Engineer the whole theory of the stresses involved in the laying of a submarine cable, and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.[38]/nThomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a character every 3.5\u00a0seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder, in 1858./nWhitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.[39]/nThe board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August./nThomson's fears were realised when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000 volts. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigour.[40]/nA joint committee of inquiry was established by the Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.[41] The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of reliability, most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.[42]/nIn July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the SS\u00a0Great Eastern but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after 1,200 miles (1,900\u00a0km) had been laid and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks, and then recovered and completed the 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was knighted on 10 November 1866./nTo exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with C. F. Varley and Fleeming Jenkin. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an automatic curb sender, a kind of telegraph key for sending messages on a cable./nThomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic submarine communications cable of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student James Alfred Ewing. He was present at the laying of the Par\u00e1 to Pernambuco section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873./nThomson's wife, Margaret, died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126-ton schooner, the Lalla Rookh[43][44] and used it as a base for entertaining friends and scientific colleagues. His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the Board of Enquiry into the sinking of HMS\u00a0Captain./nIn June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the Hooper, bound for Lisbon with 2,500 miles (4,020\u00a0km) of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in Madeira followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the Lalla Rookh. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence \"Will you marry me?\" and Fanny (Blandy's daughter Frances Anna Blandy) signalled back \"Yes\". Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874./nOver the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with Peter Guthrie Tait on a text book that founded the study of mechanics first on the mathematics of kinematics, the description of motion without regard to force. The text developed dynamics in various areas but with constant attention to energy as a unifying principle./nA second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in mathematical physics./nThomson made significant contributions to atmospheric electricity for the relatively short time for which he worked on the subject, around 1859.[45] He developed several instruments for measuring the atmospheric electric field, using some of the electrometers he had initially developed for telegraph work, which he tested at Glasgow and whilst on holiday on Arran. His measurements on Arran were sufficiently rigorous and well-calibrated that they could be used to deduce air pollution from the Glasgow area, through its effects on the atmospheric electric field.[46] Thomson's water dropper electrometer was used for measuring the atmospheric electric field at Kew Observatory and Eskdalemuir Observatory for many years,[47] and one was still in use operationally at the Kakioka Observatory in Japan[48] until early 2021. Thomson may have unwittingly observed atmospheric electrical effects caused by the Carrington event (a significant geomagnetic storm) in early September 1859.[45]/nBetween 1870 and 1890 the vortex atom theory, which purported that an atom was a vortex in the aether, was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. Thomson pioneered the theory, which was distinct from the seventeenth century vortex theory of Descartes in that Thomson was thinking in terms of a unitary continuum theory, whereas Descartes was thinking in terms of three different types of matter, each relating respectively to emission, transmission, and reflection of light.[49] About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists. Following the lead of Thomson and Tait,[50] the branch of topology called knot theory was developed. Kelvin's initiative in this complex study that continues to inspire new mathematics has led to persistence of the topic in history of science.[51]/nThomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising from, or fostered by, his experiences on the Agamemnon and the Great Eastern./nThomson introduced a method of deep-sea depth sounding, in which a steel piano wire replaces the ordinary hand line. The wire glides so easily to the bottom that \"flying soundings\" can be taken while the ship is at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson./nAbout the same time he revived the Sumner method of finding a ship's position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application./nDuring the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable compass to correct errors arising from magnetic deviation owing to the increased use of iron in naval architecture. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation due to the ship's magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the binnacle. Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by George Biddell Airy and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by The Admiralty./nScientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'./n/nThe truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.[52]/nCharles Babbage had been among the first to suggest that a lighthouse might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the Morse code for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes./nThomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring electrometer, based on the old electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.[53]/nIn 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the Niagara Falls power station. Despite his belief in the superiority of direct current electric power transmission, he endorsed Westinghouse's alternating current system which had been demonstrated at the Chicago World's Fair of that year. Even after Niagara Falls, Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.[54]/nAcknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the International Electrotechnical Commission elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26\u201327 June 1906. \"On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, G.C.V.O., O.M., was unanimously elected first President of the Commission\", minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.[55]/nKelvin made an early physics-based estimation of the age of the Earth. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth's cooling and to make historical inferences of the Earth's age from his calculations. Thomson was a creationist in a broad sense, but he was not a 'flood geologist'[56] (a view that had lost mainstream scientific support by the 1840s.[57][58] He contended that the laws of thermodynamics operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the Solar System and other structures, followed by a gradual \"heat death\". He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of uniformitarianism, that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past. He contended that \"This earth, certainly a moderate number of millions of years ago, was a red-hot globe \u2026 .\"[59]/nAfter the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of the Earth as tending to contradict Darwin's gradualist explanation of slow natural selection bringing about biological diversity. Thomson's own views favoured a version of theistic evolution sped up by divine guidance.[60] His calculations showed that the Sun could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by evolution \u2013 unless it was heated by an energy source beyond the knowledge of Victorian era science. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with geologists and with Darwin's supporters John Tyndall and T. H. Huxley. In his response to Huxley's address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address \"Of Geological Dynamics\" (1869)[61] which, among his other writings, challenged the geologists' assertion that the earth must be vastly old, perhaps billions of years in age.[62]/nThomson's initial 1864 estimate of the Earth's age was from 20 to 400 million years old. These wide limits were due to his uncertainty about the melting temperature of rock, to which he equated the Earth's interior temperature,[63][64] as well as the uncertainty in thermal conductivities and specific heats of rocks. Over the years he refined his arguments and reduced the upper bound by a factor of ten, and in 1897 Thomson, now Lord Kelvin, ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20\u201340\u00a0million years old.[59][65] In a letter published in Scientific American Supplement 1895 Kelvin criticized geologists' estimates of the age of rocks and the age of the earth, including the views published by Charles Darwin, as \"vaguely vast age\".[66]/nHis exploration of this estimate can be found in his 1897 address to the Victoria Institute, given at the request of the Institute's president George Stokes,[67] as recorded in that Institute's journal Transactions.[68] Although his former assistant John Perry published a paper in 1895 challenging Kelvin's assumption of low thermal conductivity inside the Earth, and thus showing a much greater age,[69] this had little immediate impact. The discovery in 1903 that radioactive decay releases heat led to Kelvin's estimate being challenged, and Ernest Rutherford famously made the argument in a 1904 lecture attended by Kelvin that this provided the unknown energy source Kelvin had suggested, but the estimate was not overturned until the development in 1907 of radiometric dating of rocks.[62]/nThe discovery of radioactivity largely invalidated Kelvin's estimate of the age of the Earth. Although he eventually paid off a gentleman's bet with Strutt on the importance of radioactivity in the Earth's geology, he never publicly acknowledged this because he thought he had a much stronger argument restricting the age of the Sun to no more than 20 million years. Without sunlight, there could be no explanation for the sediment record on the Earth's surface. At the time, the only known source for solar energy was gravitational collapse. It was only when thermonuclear fusion was recognised in the 1930s that Kelvin's age paradox was truly resolved.[70] However, modern cosmology recognizes the Kelvin period in the early life of a star, during which it shines from gravitational energy (correctly calculated by Kelvin) before fusion and the main sequence begins./nIn the winter of 1860\u20131861 Kelvin slipped on the ice while curling near his home at Netherhall and fractured his leg, causing him to miss the 1861 Manchester meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and to limp thereafter.[7] He remained something of a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic until his death./nThomson remained a devout believer in Christianity throughout his life; attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine.[71] He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the Christian Evidence Society,[72] 23 May 1889.[73]/nIn the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 (the original day of the coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra),[74] Kelvin was appointed a Privy Councillor and one of the first members of the new Order of Merit (OM). He received the order from the King on 8 August 1902,[75][76] and was sworn a member of the council at Buckingham Palace on 11 August 1902.[77] In his later years he often travelled to his town house at 15 Eaton Place, off Eaton Square in London's Belgravia.[7]/nIn November 1907 he caught a chill and his condition deteriorated until he died at his Scottish country seat, Netherhall, in Largs on 17 December.[78]/nAt the request of Westminster Abbey, the undertakers Wylie & Lochhead prepared an oak coffin, lined with lead. In the dark of the winter evening the cortege set off from Netherhall for Largs railway station, a distance of about a mile. Large crowds witnessed the passing of the cortege, and shopkeepers closed their premises and dimmed their lights. The coffin was placed in a special Midland and Glasgow and South Western Railway van. The train set off at 8.30 pm for Kilmarnock, where the van was attached to the overnight express to St Pancras railway station in London.[79]/nKelvin's funeral was to be held on 23 December 1907.[7] The coffin was taken from St Pancras by hearse to Westminster Abbey, where it rested overnight in St Faith's Chapel. The following day the Abbey was crowded for the funeral, including representatives from the University of Glasgow and the University of Cambridge, along with representatives from France, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Monaco. Kelvin's grave is in the nave, near the choir screen, and close to the graves of Isaac Newton, John Herschel, and Charles Darwin.[80] The pall-bearers included Darwin's son, Sir George Darwin.[81]/nBack in Scotland the University of Glasgow held a memorial service for Kelvin in the Bute Hall. Kelvin had been a member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, attached to St Columba's Episcopal Church in Largs, and when in Glasgow to St Mary's Episcopal Church (now, St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow).[79] At the same time as the funeral in Westminster Abbey, a service was held in St Columba's Episcopal Church, Largs, attended by a large congregation including burgh dignitaries.[82]/nWilliam Thomson is also memorialised on the Thomson family grave in Glasgow Necropolis. The family grave has a second modern memorial to William alongside, erected by the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow; a society of which he was president in the periods 1856\u20131858 and 1874\u20131877.[83]/nIn 1884, Thomson led a master class on \"Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light\" at Johns Hopkins University.[84] Kelvin referred to the acoustic wave equation describing sound as waves of pressure in air and attempted to describe also an electromagnetic wave equation, presuming a luminiferous aether susceptible to vibration. The study group included Michelson and Morley who subsequently performed the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment, which subsequently found no luminiferous aether. Thomson did not provide a text but A. S. Hathaway took notes and duplicated them with a Papyrograph. As the subject matter was under active development, Thomson amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Thomson's attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime. Starting from his lecture in 1884, Kelvin was also the first scientist to formulate the hypothetical concept of dark matter; he then attempted to define and locate some \"dark bodies\" in the Milky Way.[85][86]/nOn 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light to the Royal Institution.[87][88] The two \"dark clouds\" he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment) and indications that the Law of Equipartition in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the theory of relativity; for the second, quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein, in 1905, published the so-called \"Annus Mirabilis papers\", one of which explained the photoelectric effect, based on Max Planck's discovery of energy quanta which was the foundation of quantum mechanics, another of which described special relativity, and the last of which explained Brownian motion in terms of statistical mechanics, providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms./nLike many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology./nHis biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that \"When R\u00f6ntgen's discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of R\u00f6ntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until R\u00f6ntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir\"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper and seen the photographs, he wrote R\u00f6ntgen a letter saying that \"I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made\"[89] He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.[90] (See also N rays.)/nHis forecast for practical aviation (i.e., heavier-than-air aircraft) was negative.

With an improved telescope he built, he observed the stars of the Milky Way, the phases of Venus, the four largest satellites of Jupiter, Saturn's rings, lunar craters and sunspots. He also built an early microscope./nGalileo's championing of Copernican heliocentrism (Earth rotating daily and revolving around the Sun) was met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted biblical creationism.[9][10][11]/nGalileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9] He was tried by the Inquisition, found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13] During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638), primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials, summarizing work he had done around forty years earlier.[14]/nGalileo was born in Pisa (then part of the Duchy of Florence), Italy, on 15 February 1564,[15] the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist, composer, and music theorist, and Giulia Ammannati, who had married in 1562. Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority.[16]/nThree of Galileo's five siblings survived infancy. The youngest, Michelangelo (or Michelagnolo), also became a lutenist and composer who added to Galileo's financial burdens for the rest of his life.[17] Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens may have contributed to Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income.[18]/nWhen Galileo Galilei was eight, his family moved to Florence, but he was left under the care of Muzio Tedaldi for two years. When Galileo was ten, he left Pisa to join his family in Florence and there he was under the tutelage of Jacopo Borghini.[15] He was educated, particularly in logic, from 1575 to 1578 in the Vallombrosa Abbey, about 30\u00a0km southeast of Florence.[19][20]/nGalileo tended to refer to himself only by his given name. At the time, surnames were optional in Italy, and his given name had the same origin as his sometimes-family name, Galilei. Both his given and family name ultimately derive from an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, an important physician, professor, and politician in Florence in the 15th century.[21][22] Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, where about 200 years later, Galileo Galilei was also buried.[23]/nWhen he did refer to himself with more than one name, it was sometimes as Galileo Galilei Linceo, a reference to his being a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, an elite pro-science organization in Italy. It was common for mid-sixteenth-century Tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents' surname.[24] Hence, Galileo Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti. The Italian male given name \"Galileo\" (and thence the surname \"Galilei\") derives from the Latin \"Galilaeus\", meaning \"of Galilee\", a biblically significant region in Northern Israel.[25][21] Because of that region, the adjective galilaios (Greek \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, Latin Galilaeus, Italian Galileo), which means \"Galilean\", was used in antiquity (particularly by emperor Julian) to refer to Christ and his followers.[26]/nThe biblical roots of Galileo's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun.[27] In 1614, during the Galileo affair, one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini, delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential sermon. In it he made a point of quoting Acts 1:11, \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?\" (in the Latin version found in the Vulgate: Viri Galilaei, quid statis aspicientes in caelum?).[28]/nDespite being a genuinely pious Roman Catholic,[29] Galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with Marina Gamba. They had two daughters, Virginia (born 1600) and Livia (born 1601), and a son, Vincenzo (born 1606).[30]/nDue to their illegitimate birth, Galileo considered the girls unmarriageable, if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries, which would have been similar to Galileo's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters.[31] Their only worthy alternative was the religious life. Both girls were accepted by the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri and remained there for the rest of their lives.[32]/nVirginia took the name Maria Celeste upon entering the convent. She died on 2 April 1634, and is buried with Galileo at the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence. Livia took the name Sister Arcangela and was ill for most of her life. Vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of Galileo and married Sestilia Bocchineri.[33]/nAlthough Galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled in 1580 at the University of Pisa for a medical degree.[34] He was influenced by the lectures of Girolamo Borro and Francesco Buonamici of Florence.[20] In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece.[35] Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine.[35] He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. In the same year, upon invitation by the Florentine Academy, he presented two lectures, On the Shape, Location, and Size of Dante's Inferno, in an attempt to propose a rigorous cosmological model of Dante's hell.[36] Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli.[37][38]/nIn 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610.[39] During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.[40][41]/nTycho Brahe and others had observed the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's Supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.[42]/nBased only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608,[43] Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification.[44] With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the Earth\u2014it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).[45]/nOn 30 November 1609, Galileo aimed his telescope at the Moon.[46] While not being the first person to observe the Moon through a telescope (English mathematician Thomas Harriot had done it four months before but only saw a \"strange spottednesse\"),[47] Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The Moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first \"planet\", an \"eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian\", as put forth by Dante. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632,[48] although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before.[49]/nA friend of Galileo's, the painter Cigoli, included a realistic depiction of the Moon in one of his paintings, though probably used his own telescope to make the observation.[37]/nOn 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as \"three fixed stars, totally invisible[a] by their smallness\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.[50] Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \"stars\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter: he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons.[51] He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the Medicean stars, in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers.[52] Later astronomers, however, renamed them Galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were independently discovered by Simon Marius on 8 January 1610 and are now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, the names given by Marius in his Mundus Iovialis published in 1614.[53]/nGalileo's observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused controversy in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,[54][55] and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.[56][57] Compounding this problem, other astronomers had difficulty confirming Galileo's observations. When he demonstrated the telescope in Balogna, the attendees struggled to see the moons. One of them, Martin Horky, observed several stars and found them also surrounded by smaller stars. He took this as evidence that the moons were merely an internal defect of the instrument and that Galileo's imagination had run away with him. Horky's sharp attack drew a rebuke from Kepler but set the tone for later disputes.[58][59] Christopher Clavius's observatory in Rome confirmed the observations and, although unsure how to interpret them, gave Galileo a hero's welcome when he visited the next year.[60] Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods\u2014a feat which Johannes Kepler had believed impossible.[61][62]/nGalileo saw a practical use for his discovery. Determining the east\u2013west position of ships at sea required their clocks be synchronized with clocks at the prime meridian. Solving this longitude problem had great importance to safe navigation and large prizes were established by Spain and later Holland for its solution. Since eclipses of the moons he discovered were relatively frequent and their times could be predicted with great accuracy, they could be used to set shipboard clocks and Galileo applied for the prizes. Observing the moons from a ship proved too difficult, but the method was used for land surveys, including the remapping of France.[63]:\u200a15\u201316\u200a[64]/nFrom September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus exhibits a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon. The heliocentric model of the Solar System developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. In Ptolemy's geocentric model, it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, the Ptolemaic model became untenable. In the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models,[65][66] such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models,[b] each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all explained the phases of Venus without the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.[67]/nIn 1610, Galileo also observed the planet Saturn, and at first mistook its rings for planets,[68] thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented to Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.[69]/nGalileo observed the planet Neptune in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.[70]/nGalileo made naked-eye and telescopic studies of sunspots.[71] Their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics. An apparent annual variation in their trajectories, observed by Francesco Sizzi and others in 1612\u20131613,[72] also provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of Tycho Brahe.[c] A dispute over claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner. In the middle was Mark Welser, to whom Scheiner had announced his discovery, and who asked Galileo for his opinion. Both of them were unaware of Johannes Fabricius' earlier observation and publication of sunspots.[76]/nGalileo observed the Milky Way, previously believed to be nebulous, and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible to the naked eye. He observed the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.[77]/nIn the Starry Messenger, Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his Letters on Sunspots, he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be \"quite round\". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter.[78][79] He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point.[80][81][82]/nIn his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion, and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Brahe, and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable.[83][84][85] Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.[86][87]/nCardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without \"a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun\".[88] Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide such evidence.[89] This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to call his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea.[90] The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.[citation needed]/nFor Galileo, the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.[91] His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.[citation needed]/nIf this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at Venice instead of one, about 12 hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors.[92][93] Albert Einstein later expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his \"fascinating arguments\" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth.[94] Galileo also dismissed the idea, known from antiquity and by his contemporary Johannes Kepler, that the Moon[95] caused the tides\u2014Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.[96][97] Galileo continued to argue in favour of his theory of tides, considering it the ultimate proof of Earth's motion.[98]/nIn 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father Orazio Grassi, professor of mathematics at the Jesuit Collegio Romano. It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself. The title page of the book describes Galileo as a philosopher and \"Matematico Primario\" of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.[99]/nBecause The Assayer contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto.[100][101] Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618,[102] which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body that had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth,[103][104] and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the Moon, it must be farther away than the Moon.[citation needed]/nGrassi's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article, Discourse on Comets,[105] published under the name of one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself.[106] Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets,[107][108] although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. (The correct approach to the study of comets had been proposed at the time by Tycho Brahe.) In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner,[109][110][111] and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work.[109] The Jesuits were offended,[109][108] and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance,[112] under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano,[113] purporting to be one of his own pupils.[citation needed]/nThe Assayer was Galileo's devastating reply to the Astronomical Balance.[105] It has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature,[114][115] in which \"Sarsi's\" arguments are subjected to withering scorn.[116] It was greeted with wide acclaim, and particularly pleased the new pope, Urban VIII, to whom it had been dedicated.[117] In Rome, in the previous decade, Barberini, the future Urban VIII, had come down on the side of Galileo and the Lincean Academy.[118]/nGalileo's dispute with Grassi permanently alienated many Jesuits,[119] and Galileo and his friends were convinced that they were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation,[120] although supporting evidence for this is not conclusive.[121][122]/nAt the time of Galileo's conflict with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the Earth is the centre of the Universe and the orbit of all heavenly bodies, or Tycho Brahe's new system blending geocentrism with heliocentrism.[123][124] Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's writings on it combined religious and scientific objections. Religious opposition to heliocentrism arose from biblical passages implying the fixed nature of the Earth.[d] Scientific opposition came from Brahe, who argued that if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was at the time.[e] Aristarchus and Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Tycho countered that since stars appear to have measurable angular size, if the stars were that distant and their apparent size is due to their physical size, they would be far larger than the Sun. In fact, it is not possible to observe the physical size of distant stars without modern telescopes.[127][f]/nGalileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609. In December 1613, the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, Benedetto Castelli, with biblical objections to the motion of the Earth.[g] Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the Bible was an authority on faith and morals, not science. This letter was not published, but circulated widely.[128] Two years later, Galileo wrote a letter to Christina that expanded his arguments previously made in eight pages to forty pages.[129]/nBy 1615, Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccol\u00f2 Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible,[d] which was seen as a violation of the Council of Trent and looked dangerously like Protestantism.[130] Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli.[131] Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his ideas. At the start of 1616, Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed.[132] Ingoli may have been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, with the essay providing the basis for the Inquisition's actions.[133] The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from Tycho Brahe's arguments, notably that heliocentrism would require the stars as they appeared to be much larger than the Sun.[h] The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas.[135]/nIn February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture\". The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and\u00a0... in regard to theological truth, it is at least erroneous in faith\".[136] Pope Paul V instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo, and to order him to abandon heliocentrism. On 26 February, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered \"to abandon completely\u00a0... the opinion that the sun stands still at the centre of the world and the Earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing.\"[137] The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus and other heliocentric works until correction.[137]/nFor the next decade, Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the admonition of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.[138]/nEarlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, \"Simplicio\" in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\".[139][140] This portrayal of Simplicio made Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory.[citation needed]/nMost historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.[i] However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy.[citation needed]/nGalileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings[144] in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.[145][146][147]/nThe sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts:/nAccording to popular legend, after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase \"And yet it moves\". There was a claim that a 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words \"E pur si muove\" written on the wall of his dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death. Based on the painting, Stillman Drake wrote  \"there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death\".[157] However, an intensive investigation by astrophysicist Mario Livio has revealed that said painting is most probably a copy of an 1837 painting by the Flemish painter Roman-Eugene Van Maldeghem.[158]/nAfter a period with the friendly Ascanio Piccolomini (the Archbishop of Siena), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634, where he spent part of his life under house arrest. Galileo was ordered to read the Seven Penitential Psalms once a week for the next three years. However, his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him of the burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself.[159]/nIt was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials, published in Holland to avoid the censor. This book was highly praised by Albert Einstein.[160] As a result of this work, Galileo is often called the \"father of modern physics\". He went completely blind in 1638 and developed a painful hernia and insomnia, so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice.[14]/nDava Sobel argues that prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues that the problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.[161] Mario Livio places Galileo and his discoveries in modern scientific and social contexts. In particular, he argues that the Galileo affair has its counterpart in science denial.[162]/nGalileo continued to receive visitors until his death on 8 January 1642, aged 77, following a fever and heart palpitations.[14][163] The Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando II, wished to bury him in the main body of the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.[164][165]/nThese plans were dropped, however, after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, protested,[164][165][166] because Galileo had been condemned by the Catholic Church for \"vehement suspicion of heresy\".[167] He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy.[164][168] He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour;[169][170] during this move, three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains.[171] One of these fingers is currently on exhibition at the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy.[172]/nThis and other facts, not few in number or less worth knowing, I have succeeded in proving; and what I consider more important, there have been opened up to this vast and most excellent science, of which my work is merely the beginning, ways and means by which other minds more acute than mine will explore its remote corners./nGalileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiments and mathematics.[173] More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension.[174] These observations lay within the framework of the Pythagorean tradition of music, well known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related to music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.[175]/nGalileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In The Assayer, he wrote \"Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe\u00a0... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;....\"[176] His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy.[177] His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation./nIn order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning.[citation needed] Galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galileo further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola,[178][179][180] but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.[178][181][182]/nUsing his refracting telescope, Galileo observed in late 1609 that the surface of the Moon is not smooth.[37] Early the next year, he observed the four largest moons of Jupiter.[52] Later in 1610, he observed the phases of Venus\u2014a proof of heliocentrism\u2014as well as Saturn, though he thought the planet's rings were two other planets.[68] In 1612, he observed Neptune and noted its motion, but did not identify it as a planet.[70]/nGalileo made studies of sunspots,[71] the Milky Way, and made various observations about stars, including how to measure their apparent size without a telescope.[80][81][82]/nHe coined the term Aurora Borealis in 1619 from the Roman goddess of the dawn and the Greek name for the north wind, to describe lights in the northern and southern sky when particles from the solar wind energise the magnetosphere.[183]/nGalileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.[184]/nIn 1593, Galileo constructed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.[citation needed]/nIn 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani,[185][186] at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei.[187] In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects.[188][189] By 1624, Galileo had used a compound microscope. He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria,[190] and in September, he sent another to Prince Cesi.[191] The Linceans played a role again in naming the \"microscope\" a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (micron) meaning \"small\", and \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd (skopein) meaning \"to look at\". The word was meant to be analogous with \"telescope\".[192][193] Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope.[191]/nIn 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required the development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison.[194] Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.[citation needed]/nGalileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding. In 1630 Mario Guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a scheme by Bartolotti to cut a new channel for the Bisenzio River near Florence.[195]/nGalileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and Ren\u00e9 Descartes, was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton./nGalileo conducted several experiments with pendulums. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer.  The first recorded interest in pendulums made by Galileo were in his posthumously published notes titled On Motion,[196] but later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous, i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the amplitude. In fact, this is only approximately true,[197] as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum./nGalileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its verge escapement, would have been a poor timekeeper.[citation needed]/nGalileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency./nBy the 17th century, water pump designs had improved to the point that they produced measurable vacuums, but this was not immediately understood. What was known was that suction pumps could not pull water beyond a certain height: 18 Florentine yards according to a measurement taken around 1635, or about 34 feet (10\u00a0m).[198] This limit was a concern in irrigation projects, mine drainage, and decorative water fountains planned by the Duke of Tuscany, so the duke commissioned Galileo to investigate the problem. In his Two New Sciences (1638) Galileo suggested, incorrectly, that the column of water pulled up by a water pump would break of its own weight once reaching beyond 34 feet.[198]/nIn 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.[199] Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.[200] The speed of light has since been determined to be far too fast to be measured by such methods./nGalileo put forward the basic principle of relativity, that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity./nThat unequal weights would fall with the same speed may have been proposed as early as by the Roman philosopher Lucretius.[201] Observations that similarly sized objects of different weights fall at the same speed is documented in sixth century works by John Philoponus, which Galileo was aware of.[202][203] In the 14th century, Nicole Oresme had derived the time-squared law for uniformly accelerated change,[204][205] and in the 16th century, Domingo de Soto had suggested that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated.[206] De Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance, recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity./nIn 1586, Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot dropped lead balls from the Nieuwe Kerk in the Dutch city of Delft. The experiment established that objects of identical size, but different masses, fall at the same speed.[35][207]  While the Delft tower experiment had been a success, it was not conducted with the same scientific rigor that later experiments were. Stevin was forced to rely on audio feedback (caused by the spheres impacting a wooden platform below) to deduce that the balls had fallen at the same speed. The experiment was given less credence than the more substantive work of Galileo Galilei and his famous Leaning Tower of Pisa thought experiment of 1589./nA biography by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the same material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.[208] This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight.[209][210] While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place.[211] An exception is Stillman Drake,[212] who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. However, most of Galileo's experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.[213]/nIn his 1638 Two New Sciences, Galileo's character Salviati, widely regarded as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. Salviati also held that this could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weights but which were otherwise similar.[citation needed]/nGalileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum.[214][215] He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest\u2014namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d\u221dt2).[206][216] Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms.)[citation needed]/nGalileo also concluded that objects retain their velocity in the absence of any impediments to their motion,[217] thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called \"violent\", \"unnatural\", or \"forced\" motion so long as an agent of change (the \"mover\") continued to act on it.[218] Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Galileo stated:[219][220]/nImagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits./nBut the surface of the earth would be an instance of such a plane if all its unevenness could be removed.[221] This was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (first law), except for the direction of the motion: Newton's is straight, Galileo's is circular (for example, the planets' motion around the Sun, which according to him, and unlike Newton, takes place in absence of gravity). According to Dijksterhuis Galileo's conception of inertia as a tendency to persevere in circular motion is closely related to his Copernican conviction.[222]/nWhile Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as set forth in the fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes. The concept now named Galileo's paradox was not original with him. His proposed solution, that infinite numbers cannot be compared, is no longer considered useful.[223]/nThe Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo's death, and the controversy subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned Dialogue) in Florence.[224] In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works[225] which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue.[226][225] In 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained.[227][225] All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.[228][229]/nInterest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century when Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism.[9] Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the \"most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments\".[230] His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: \"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo.\"[231]/nOn 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the Sapienza University of Rome,[232][233] Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called \"a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today\".[234] Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying: \"The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.\"[234] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say: \"It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views.\"[234]/nOn 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II acknowledged that the Inquisition had erred in condemning Galileo for asserting that the Earth revolves around the Sun. \"John Paul said the theologians who condemned Galileo did not recognize the formal distinction between the Bible and its interpretation.\"[235]/nIn March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls.[236] In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy.[237] A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo on the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.[238]/nAccording to Stephen Hawking, Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else,[239] and Albert Einstein called him the father of modern science.[240][241]/nGalileo's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) as the Galilean moons. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft,[242] the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the Galileo global satellite navigation system, the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the Galileo, which is a non-SI unit of acceleration.[citation needed]/nPartly because the year 2009 was the fourth centenary of Galileo's first recorded astronomical observations with the telescope, the United Nations scheduled it to be the International Year of Astronomy.[243] A global scheme was laid out by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), also endorsed by UNESCO\u2014the UN body responsible for educational, scientific and cultural matters. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.[citation needed]/nPlanet Galileo and asteroid 697 Galilea are named in his honour.[citation needed]/nGalileo is mentioned several times in the \"opera\" section of the Queen song, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".[244] He features prominently in the song \"Galileo\" performed by the Indigo Girls and Amy Grant's \"Galileo\" on her Heart in Motion album.[245]/nTwentieth-century plays have been written on Galileo's life, including Life of Galileo (1943) by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, with a film adaptation (1975) of it, and Lamp at Midnight (1947) by Barrie Stavis,[246] as well as the 2008 play \"Galileo Galilei\".[247]/nKim Stanley Robinson wrote a science fiction novel entitled Galileo's Dream (2009), in which Galileo is brought into the future to help resolve a crisis of scientific philosophy; the story moves back and forth between Galileo's own time and a hypothetical distant future and contains a great deal of biographical information.[248]/nGalileo Galilei was recently selected as a main motif for a high-value collectors' coin: the \u20ac25 International Year of Astronomy commemorative coin, minted in 2009. This coin also commemorates the 400th anniversary of the invention of Galileo's telescope. The obverse shows a portion of his portrait and his telescope. The background shows one of his first drawings of the surface of the moon. In the silver ring, other telescopes are depicted: the Isaac Newton Telescope, the observatory in Kremsm\u00fcnster Abbey, a modern telescope, a radio telescope and a space telescope. In 2009, the Galileoscope was also released. This is a mass-produced, low-cost educational 2-inch (51\u00a0mm) telescope with relatively high quality.[citation needed]/nGalileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled The Little Balance (La Billancetta) describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water[249] and the 1606 printed manual Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare on the operation of a geometrical and military compass.[250]/nHis early works on dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian\u2013Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.[citation needed]/nGalileo's 1610 The Starry Messenger (Sidereus Nuncius) was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope. It reported his discoveries of:/nGalileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled Letters on Sunspots suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible.[251] The Letters on Sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling \"appendages\" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\" which was not published in printed form until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the Letter to Castelli, which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture.[252] In 1616, after the order by the Inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the \"Discourse on the Tides\" (Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare) based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini.[253] In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title Discourse on the Comets (Discorso Delle Comete), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.[254]/nIn 1623, Galileo published The Assayer\u2014Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church.[255] Following the success of The Assayer, Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non-geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned from publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.[citation needed]/nGalileo's main written works are as follows:[256]/nIn the last years of his life, Galileo Galilei kept a library of at least 598 volumes (560 of which have been identified) at Villa Il Gioiello, on the outskirts of Florence.[258] Under the restrictions of house arrest, he was forbidden to write or publish his ideas. However, he continued to receive visitors right up to his death and it was through them that he remained supplied with the latest scientific texts from Northern Europe.[259]/nWith his past experience, Galileo may have feared that his collection of books and manuscripts would be seized by the authorities and burned, as no reference to such items was made in his last will and testament. An itemized inventory was only later produced after Galileo's death, when the majority of his possessions including his library passed to his son, Vincenzo Galilei, Jr. On his death in 1649, the collection was inherited by his wife Sestilia Bocchineri.[259]/nGalileo's books, personal papers and unedited manuscripts were then collected by Vincenzo Viviani, his former assistant and student, with the intent of preserving his old teacher's works in published form. It was a project that never materialised and in his final will, Viviani bequeathed a significant portion of the collection to the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence, where there already existed an extensive library. The value of Galileo's possessions was not realised, and duplicate copies were dispersed to other libraries, such as the Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati, the public library in Sienna. In a later attempt to specialise the library's holdings, volumes unrelated to medicine were transferred to the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, an early foundation for what was to become the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, the National Central Library in Florence.[259]/nA small portion of Viviani's collection, including the manuscripts of Galileo and those of his peers Evangelista Torricelli and Benedetto Castelli, were left to his nephew, Abbot Jacopo Panzanini. This minor collection was preserved until Panzanini's death when it passed to his great-nephews, Carlo and Angelo Panzanini. The books from both Galileo and Viviani's collections began to disperse as the heirs failed to protect their inheritance. Their servants sold several of the volumes for waste paper. Around 1750 the Florentine senator Giovanni Battista Clemente de'Nelli heard of this and purchased the books and manuscripts from the shopkeepers, and the remainder of Viviani's collection from the Panzanini brothers. As recounted in Nelli's memoirs: \"My great fortune in obtaining such a wonderful treasure so cheaply came about through the ignorance of the people selling it, who were not aware of the value of those manuscripts...\"/nThe library remained in Nelli's care until his death in 1793. Knowing the value of their father's collected manuscripts, Nelli's sons attempted to sell what was left to them to the French government. Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany intervened in the sale and purchased the entire collection. The archive of manuscripts, printed books and personal papers were deposited with the Biblioteca Palatina in Florence, merging the collection with the Biblioteca Magliabechiana in 1861.[259]", "56558134": "Dmitry Borisovich Fuchs (\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0424\u0443\u043a\u0441,[1] born 30 September 1939, Kazan,[2] Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic) is a Russian-American mathematician, specializing in the representation theory of infinite-dimensional Lie groups and in topology.[3]/nFuchs received in 1964 his Russian candidate degree (Ph.D.) under Albert S.

Hamkins proved that any two countable models of set theory are comparable by embeddability, and in particular that every countable model of set theory embeds into its own constructible universe.[18]/nIn his philosophical work, Hamkins has defended a multiverse perspective of mathematical truth,[19][20] arguing that diverse concepts of set give rise to different set-theoretic universes with different theories of mathematical truth.

In cooperative game theory he contributed to the solution concepts called the core and the Shapley value./nRegarding repeated games and stochastic games, Mertens 1982[2] and 1986[3] survey articles, and his 1994[4] survey co-authored with Sylvain Sorin and Shmuel Zamir, are compendiums of results on this topic, including his own contributions. Mertens also made contributions to probability theory[5] and published articles on elementary topology.[6][7]/nMertens and Zamir[8][9] implemented John Harsanyi's proposal to model games with incomplete information by supposing that each player is characterized by a privately known type that describes his feasible strategies and payoffs as well as a probability distribution over other players' types. They constructed a universal space of types in which, subject to specified consistency conditions, each type corresponds to the infinite hierarchy of his probabilistic beliefs about others' probabilistic beliefs. They also showed that any subspace can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a finite subspace, which is the usual tactic in applications.[10]/nRepeated games with incomplete information, were pioneered by Aumann and Maschler.[11][12]  Two of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens's contributions to the field are the extensions of repeated two person zero-sum games with incomplete information on both sides for both (1) the type of information available to players and (2) the signalling structure.[13]/nIn those set-ups Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens provided an extension of the characterization of the minmax and maxmin value for the infinite game in the dependent case with state independent signals.[14] Additionally with Shmuel Zamir,[15] Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens showed the existence of a limiting value. Such a value can be thought either as the limit of the values \n\n\n\n\nv\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{n}}\n\n of the \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n stage games, as \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n goes to infinity, or the limit of the values \n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v_{\\lambda }}\n\n of the \n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\lambda }}\n\n-discounted games, as agents become more patient and \n\n\n\n\n\u03bb\n\n\u2192\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\lambda }\\to 1}\n\n./nA building block of Mertens and Zamir's approach is the construction of an operator, now simply referred to as the MZ operator in the field in their honor. In continuous time (differential games with incomplete information), the MZ operator becomes an infinitesimal operator at the core of the theory of such games.[16][17][18] Unique solution of a pair of functional equations,\nMertens and Zamir showed that the limit value may be a transcendental function unlike the maxmin or the minmax (value in the complete information case).\nMertens also found the exact rate of convergence in the case of game with incomplete information on one side and general signalling structure.[19]\nA detailed analysis of the speed of convergence  of the n-stage game (finitely repeated) value to its limit has profound links to the central limit theorem and the normal law, as well as the maximal variation of bounded martingales.[20][21] Attacking the study of the difficult case of games with state dependent signals and without recursive structure, Mertens and Zamir introduced new tools on the introduction based on an auxiliary game, reducing down the set of strategies to a core that is 'statistically sufficient.'[22][23]/nCollectively Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens's contributions with Zamir (and also with Sorin) provide the foundation for a general theory for two person zero sum repeated games that encompasses stochastic and incomplete information aspects and where concepts of wide relevance are deployed as for example reputation, bounds on rational levels for the payoffs,  but also tools like splitting lemma, signalling  and approachability. While in many ways Mertens's work here goes back to the von Neumann original roots of game theory with a zero-sum two person set up, vitality and innovations with wider application have been pervasive./nStochastic games were introduced by Lloyd Shapley in 1953.[24]  The first paper studied the discounted two-person zero-sum stochastic game with finitely many states and actions and demonstrates the existence of a value and stationary optimal strategies. The study of the undiscounted case evolved in the following three decades,  with solutions of special cases by Blackwell and Ferguson in 1968[25]  and Kohlberg in 1974. The existence of an undiscounted value in a very strong sense, both a uniform value and a limiting average value, was proved in 1981 by  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens and Abraham Neyman.[26] The study of the non-zero-sum with a general state and action spaces attracted much attention, and Mertens and Parthasarathy[27] proved a general existence result under the condition that the transitions, as a function of the state and actions, are norm continuous in the actions./nMertens had the idea to use linear competitive economies as an order book (trading) to model limit orders and generalize double auctions to a multivariate set up.[28] Acceptable relative prices of players are conveyed by their linear preferences, money can be one of the goods and it is ok for agents to have positive marginal utility for money in this case (after all agents are really just orders!). In fact this is the case for most order in practice. More than one order (and corresponding order-agent) can come from same actual agent. In equilibrium good sold must have been at a relative price compared to the good bought no less than the one implied by the utility function. Goods brought to the market (quantities in the order) are conveyed by initial endowments. Limit order are represented as follows: the order-agent brings one good to the market and has non zero marginal utilities in that good and another one (money or numeraire). An at market sell order will have a zero utility for the good sold at market and positive for money or the numeraire.  Mertens clears orders creating a matching engine by using the competitive equilibrium \u2013 in spite of most usual interiority conditions being violated for the auxiliary linear economy. Mertens's mechanism provides a generalization of Shapley\u2013Shubik trading posts and has the potential of a real life implementation with limit orders across markets rather than with just one specialist in one market./nThe diagonal formula in the theory of non-atomic cooperatives games elegantly attributes the Shapley value of each infinitesimal player as his marginal contribution to the worth of a perfect sample of the population of players when averaged over all possible sample sizes. Such a marginal contribution has been most easily expressed in the form of a derivative\u2014leading to the diagonal formula formulated by Aumann and Shapley. This is the historical reason why some\ndifferentiability conditions have been originally required to define Shapley value of non-atomic cooperative games. But first exchanging the order of taking the \"average over all possible sample sizes\" and taking such a derivative, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens uses the smoothing effect of such an averaging process to extend the applicability of the diagonal formula.[29] This trick alone works well for majority games (represented by a step function applied on the percentage of population in the coalition). Exploiting even further this commutation idea of taking averages before taking derivative, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mertens expends by looking at invariant transformations and taking averages over those, before taking the derivative. Doing so, Mertens expends the diagonal formula to a much larger space of games, defining a Shapley value at the same time.[30][31]/nSolution concepts that are refinements[32] of Nash equilibrium have been motivated primarily by arguments for backward induction and forward induction. Backward induction posits that a player's optimal action now anticipates the optimality of his and others' future actions. The refinement called subgame perfect equilibrium implements a weak version of backward induction, and increasingly stronger versions are sequential equilibrium, perfect equilibrium, quasi-perfect equilibrium, and proper equilibrium, where the latter three are obtained as limits of perturbed strategies. Forward induction posits that a player's optimal action now presumes the optimality of others' past actions whenever that is consistent with his observations. Forward induction[33] is satisfied by a sequential equilibrium for which a player's belief at an information set assigns probability only to others' optimal strategies that enable that information to be reached. In particular since completely mixed Nash equilibrium are sequential \u2013 such equilibria when they exist satisfy both forward and backward induction. In his work Mertens manages for the first time to select Nash equilibria that  satisfy both forward and backward induction. The method is to let such feature be inherited from perturbed games that are forced to have completely mixed strategies\u2014and the goal is only achieved with Mertens-stable equilibria, not with the simpler Kohlberg Mertens equilibria./nElon Kohlberg and Mertens[34] emphasized that a solution concept should be consistent with an admissible decision rule. Moreover, it should satisfy the invariance principle that it should not depend on which among the many equivalent representations of the strategic situation as an extensive-form game is used. In particular, it should depend only on the reduced normal form of the game obtained after elimination of pure strategies that are redundant because their payoffs for all players can be replicated by a mixture of other pure strategies. Mertens[35][36] emphasized also the importance of the small worlds principle that a solution concept should depend only on the ordinal properties\nof players' preferences, and should not depend on whether the game includes extraneous players whose actions have no effect on the original players' feasible strategies and payoffs./nKohlberg and Mertens defined tentatively a set-valued solution concept called stability for games with finite numbers of pure strategies that satisfies admissibility, invariance and forward induction, but a counterexample showed that it need not satisfy backward induction; viz. the set might not include a sequential equilibrium. Subsequently, Mertens[37][38] defined a refinement, also called stability and now often called a set of Mertens-stable equilibria, that has several desirable properties:/nFor two-player games with perfect recall and generic payoffs, stability is equivalent to just three of these properties: a stable set uses only undominated strategies, includes a quasi-perfect equilibrium, and is immune to embedding in a larger game.[39]/nA stable set is defined mathematically by (in brief) essentiality of the projection map from a closed connected neighborhood in the graph of the Nash equilibria over the space of perturbed games obtained by perturbing players' strategies toward completely mixed strategies. This definition entails more than the property that every nearby game has a nearby equilibrium. Essentiality requires further that no deformation of the projection maps to the boundary, which ensures that perturbations of the fixed point problem defining Nash equilibria have nearby solutions. This is apparently necessary to obtain all the desirable properties listed above./nA social welfare function (SWF) maps profiles of individual preferences to social preferences over a fixed set of alternatives.  In a seminal paper Arrow (1950)[40] showed the famous \"Impossibility Theorem\", i.e. there does not exist an SWF that satisfies a very minimal system of axioms: Unrestricted Domain, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, the Pareto criterion and Non-dictatorship. A large literature documents various ways to relax Arrow's axioms to get possibility results.\nRelative Utilitarianism (RU) (Dhillon and Mertens, 1999)[41] is a SWF that consists of normalizing individual utilities between 0 and 1 and adding them, and is a \"possibility\" result that is derived from a system of axioms that are very close to Arrow's original ones but modified for the space of preferences over lotteries.  Unlike classical Utilitarianism, RU does not assume cardinal utility or interpersonal comparability. Starting from individual preferences over lotteries, which are assumed to satisfy the von-Neumann\u2013Morgenstern axioms (or equivalent), the axiom system uniquely fixes the interpersonal comparisons. The theorem can be interpreted as providing an axiomatic foundation for the \"right\" interpersonal comparisons, a problem that has plagued social choice theory for a long time.  The axioms are:/nThe main theorem shows that RU satisfies all the axioms and if the number of individuals is bigger than three, number of candidates is bigger than 5 then any SWF satisfying the above axioms is equivalent to RU, whenever there exist at least 2 individuals who do not have exactly the same or exactly the opposite preferences./nRelative utilitarianism[41] can serve to rationalize using 2% as an intergenerationally fair social discount rate for cost-benefit analysis.\nMertens and Rubinchik[42]  show that a shift-invariant welfare function defined on a rich space of (temporary) policies,\nif differentiable, has as a derivative a discounted sum of the policy (change), with a fixed discount rate, i.e., the induced social discount rate.\n(Shift-invariance requires a function evaluated on a shifted policy to return an affine transformation of the value of the original policy, while\nthe coefficients depend on the time-shift only.)\nIn an overlapping generations model with exogenous growth (with time being the whole real line), relative utilitarian function\nis shift-invariant when evaluated on (small temporary) policies around a balanced growth equilibrium (with capital stock growing exponentially).\nWhen policies are represented as changes in endowments of individuals (transfers or taxes), and utilities of all\ngenerations are weighted equally, the social discount rate\ninduced by relative utilitarianism is the growth rate of per capita GDP (2% in the U.S.[43]).\nThis is also consistent with the current practices described in the Circular A-4 of the US Office of Management and Budget, stating:", "98912": "J\u00e1nos Bolyai (Hungarian: [\u02c8ja\u02d0no\u0283 \u02c8bo\u02d0j\u0252i]; 15 December 1802 \u2013 27 January 1860) or Johann Bolyai,[2] was a Hungarian mathematician who developed absolute geometry\u2014a geometry that includes both Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world.[3]/nBolyai was born in the town of Kolozsv\u00e1r, Grand Principality of Transylvania (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania), the son of Zsuzsanna Benk\u0151 and the well-known mathematician Farkas Bolyai./nBy the age of 13, he had mastered calculus and other forms of analytical mechanics, receiving instruction from his father. He studied at the Imperial and Royal Military Academy (TherMilAk) in Vienna from 1818 to 1822, and Bolyai received his commission as sub-lieutenant. At the age of 21, he was already a lieutenant, at the age of 22, a first lieutenant and at the age of 24, a captain.[4]/nBolyai became so obsessed with Euclid's parallel postulate that his father, who had pursued the same subject for many years, wrote to him in 1820: \"You must not attempt this approach to parallels. I know this way to the very end. I have traversed this bottomless night, which extinguished all light and joy in my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone...Learn from my example.\"[5]/nJ\u00e1nos, however, persisted in his quest and eventually came to the conclusion that the postulate is independent of the other axioms of geometry and that different consistent geometries can be constructed on its negation. In 1823, he wrote to his father: \"I have discovered such wonderful things that I was amazed...out of nothing I have created a strange new universe.\"[5][6] Between 1820 and 1823 he had prepared a treatise on parallel lines that he called absolute geometry. Bolyai's work was published in 1832 as an appendix to a mathematics textbook by his father./nCarl Friedrich Gauss, on reading the Appendix, wrote in a letter \"I regard this young geometer Bolyai as a genius of the first order.\"[7] To his old friend Farkas Bolyai, however, Gauss wrote: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work...coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"[8][5][7][6] Indeed, Gauss had disclosed his discovery of a consistent non-Euclidean geometry in a letter in 1827, and in 1829 wrote that he feared backlash if he published about it.[9] J\u00e1nos suspected that Gauss had been secretly informed about his discoveries by his father, causing a rift between him and his father.[10] He later bitterly complained about Gauss's attitude.[11]/nIn 1848 Bolyai learned that Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky had published a piece of work similar to his appendix in 1829. Though Lobachevsky published his work a few years earlier than Bolyai, it contained only hyperbolic geometry. Working independently, Bolyai and Lobachevsky pioneered the investigation of non-Euclidean geometry./nIn addition to his work in geometry, Bolyai developed a rigorous geometric concept of complex numbers as ordered pairs of real numbers. Although he never published more than the 24 pages of the Appendix, he left more than 20,000 pages of mathematical manuscripts when he died. These can now be found in the Teleki-Bolyai Library in T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, where Bolyai died.

He fought them all in succession\u2014making it his only condition that he should be allowed to play on his violin for an interval between meeting each opponent. He disarmed or wounded all his antagonists. It can be easily imagined that a temperament such as his was not one congenial to his military superiors. He was retired in 1833.[14]/nNo original portrait of Bolyai survives.

There is also a mathematical award given out every five years, named the Bolyai Prize.

He is the author of numerous books about management, conflict, and behavioral research applications, including Human Organization: Its Management and Value and New Ways of Managing Conflict./nRensis Likert was born in 1903 to George Herbert Likert and Cornelia Zonna Adrianna (Cora) Likert in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Influenced by his father, an engineer with the Union Pacific Railroad, Likert studied civil engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for three years. He worked as an intern with the Union Pacific Railroad during the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, which sparked his interest in studying organizational behavior.[citation needed]/nAt the University of Michigan, Likert switched from studying civil engineering to economics and sociology due to the influence of professor Robert Angell.[citation needed] Likert received a B.A. in sociology in 1926. Upon graduation, he studied at the Union Theological Seminary for a year. He then went on to earn a Ph.D. in psychology at Columbia University in 1932.[2] While studying at Columbia University, he approached the nascent  discipline of social psychology. In 1938, he co-authored Public Opinion and the Individual with his mentor at Columbia, Gardner Murphy./nOn August 31, 1928, Likert married Jane Gibson(editor and consultant) while at Columbia University, having met at the University of Michigan.[2] They had two daughters: Elizabeth David Likert and Patricia Pohlman Likert.[3] In 1969, Likert retired as Director of the Institute for Social Research.[4] The couple moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he formed Rensis Likert Associates. Likert died at 78 years of age on September 3, 1981, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[citation needed]/nIn 1935, Likert became Director of Research for the Life Insurance Agency Management Association (LIAMA) in Hartford, Connecticut. There, Likert began a research program to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different modes of supervision.[5] The research lead to the development of the three volumes of moral and agency management.[6]/nIn 1939, Likert was invited by Henry Wallace to organize the Division of Program Surveys (DPS) at the Bureau of Agriculture Statistics (BAS). Its purpose was to gather farmers' thoughts about USDA-sponsored New Deal programs and to combat the effects of the Great Depression. During World War II, as the director of the Program Surveys Division in the USDA's Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), Likert ran surveys for the USDA. But as the war progressed, the division ran program surveys for multiple government agencies, including the Office of War Information, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. In 1943, he developed the first national geographic sampling frame. During the war, Likert recruited other social psychologists into the growing government survey department.[7]/nOn December 7, 1941, Likert gained support from the federal government on his program survey. From this the National survey was introduced which helped the federal government make decision on World War II.  There were new interviews and sample methods that were the outcome of the program survey through the support of the federal government and other agencies.[8]/nAfter the end of the war, the Department of Agriculture was forced by Congress to stop its social survey work.[citation needed] Likert and his team (many of them academics on temporary wartime duty) decided to move to a university. They accepted an offer in the summer of 1946 from the University of Michigan to form the Survey Research Center (SRC).[7] In 1949, when Dorwin Cartwright moved the Center for Group Dynamics from MIT to the University of Michigan in 1949, the SRC became the Institute for Social Research (ISR).[9] Likert was the director of the ISR until his retirement in 1970./nUpon retirement, Likert founded Rensis Likert Associates to consult for numerous corporations. He also helped start the Institute for Corporate Productivity. During his tenure at the Institute for Corporate Productivity, Likert devoted particular attention to research on organizations. During the 1960s and 1970s, his books on management theory were closely studied in Japan and their impact can be seen across modern Japanese organizations. He completed research on major corporations around the world, and his studies have accurately predicted the subsequent performance of the corporations.[10]/nLikert contributed to the field of psychometrics by developing open-ended interviewing, a technique used to collect information about a person's thoughts, experiences, and preferences. It was common in the 1930s for researchers to use objective, closed-ended questions for the coding process to be valid. While this technique was used well in many domains, Likert saw the need for more opportunities to ask people about their attitudes towards various issues. Within open-ended interviewing, he and his colleagues invented the \"funneling technique\", which is a way to keep the interview open for comments, but directed in a specific way. The interview would begin with open-ended questions but gradually move into more narrowed questions. Today, open-ended interviewing is largely used in research studies where there is a need to understand people's attitudes./nLikert is best known for the Likert scale. Likert created the method in 1932 as part of his Ph.D. thesis to identify the extent of a person's attitudes and feelings towards international affairs.[11] The Likert scale is used in conducting surveys, with applications to business-related areas such as marketing or customer satisfaction, the social sciences, and attitude-related research projects./nA Likert scale consists of the sum or average of scores from responses to a group of survey questions.  These scores are transformed into a scale score through psychometric methods.[12][13]/nLikert developed his management systems in the 1950s.[14][15]  He outlined four systems of management to describe the relationship, involvement, and roles of managers and subordinates in industrial settings.

Colonel Dan Bryan, head of Ireland's G2 intelligence service, made the initial approaches to the newly appointed director in 1940 when a cipher was found on the first German agent to be captured in Ireland, Wilhelm Preetz.[3] Hayes made significant progress in breaking the code and in February 1941, at the behest of \u00c9amon de Valera, he was given an office and three lieutenants to decode wireless messages being covertly transmitted from a house in north Dublin owned by the German legation. One of his staff was Kevin Boland, son of the then justice minister Gerald Boland. The operation was so secret that the younger Boland was instructed not to tell his father what he was doing./nOne of the most notorious German spies interned in Ireland during the war, G\u00fcnther Sch\u00fctz, described him as \"absolutely brilliant\".[citation needed] As far as Sch\u00fctz and the other German spies whose cells he entered during the Emergency knew, their quiet-spoken and polite interrogator was \"Captain Grey\", a mysterious military figure always accompanied by another intelligence officer. Only a handful of people in G2 military intelligence knew that \"Captain Grey\", one of the most important and prolific code-breakers of the second World War, was not a military man at all.[3]:\u200a219/nMembers of MI5 believed \"his gifts amounted almost to genius\"[4] and described him as Ireland's \"greatest unsung hero\".[5] The US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) characterised him as \"a colossus of a man\".[5]/nIt is only in recent years that the importance and extent of Hayes's work has become known.[6] During the war his own family didn't know the nature of his role with military intelligence. His daughter Faerie, aged seven when the war broke out, only learnt recently that her father used her school exercise book to decode complex German ciphers.[citation needed] Even G\u00fcnther Sch\u00fctz went to his grave in 1991 still believing that it was another man, Commandant de Butl\u00e9ir, who was responsible for identifying his microdot codes \u2013 the first cryptologist in the world to do so./nG\u00fcnther Sch\u00fctz was dropped into Ireland on 12 March 1941 to make contact with IRA members sympathetic to the German cause and to transmit weather reports[3]:\u200a159\u200a back to his handlers in Hamburg.  Sch\u00fctz readily gave up one of his codes to his Irish captors in the hope of diverting attention from his microdots, but a microscope in his luggage raised the suspicions of the authorities and his belongings were handed over to Hayes, who spotted Sch\u00fctz's codes. In all, 30 pages of operating instructions as well as extensive lists of names and addresses of Nazi sympathisers in the Republic were secreted in random characters in newspaper cuttings that the German intelligence agent was carrying when he was picked up by garda\u00ed in Wexford in 1941. Hayes studied two newspaper cuttings tucked into the spy's pocket book and in a testimonial letter affirming the curative qualities of Aspro, he identified messages, reduced in size 400 times, and secreted within three letter 'o's in the text. On an article about Oxford Pamphlets, he spotted a further four microdots, with three more in an ad for the Green Park Hotel. Within 10 days of Sch\u00fctz's arrest, Hayes had found and translated the entire contents of his highly sensitive microdots. It would take the FBI a further four months to even identify that such a system of transmitting messages existed. \"The Germans were so cocksure that the microdots couldn't be discovered that they didn't even encode them\", Sch\u00fctz said after the war. \"They were to be a vital weapon in espionage. Finding them as the Irish intelligence officers did was an act of brilliance.\"[citation needed]/nHayes had some success decoding cable messages, but it was working on complex letter based ciphers that he demonstrated his brilliance as a code breaker. When Major Hermann Goertz, the most senior Nazi agent to be captured in Ireland, was arrested at the end of 1941,[3]:\u200a340\u200a he was carrying a code later described by MI5 as \"one of the best three or four in the war\". A similar cipher had already baffled cryptologists at Bletchley Park, the headquarters of British code-breaking activity, but Hayes finally identified a system of decoding it[3]:\u200a237\u200a based on a sequence of rotating keywords. The first of the Goertz messages to be successfully decoded was unlocked with the key 'Cathleen Ni Houlihan'. Informed of the breakthrough Hayes had made, Cecil Liddell of MI5 visited Dublin in 1943 and the two secret services continued to share intelligence information until the end of the war. Afterwards, Liddell said that there was a \"whole series of ciphers that couldn't have been solved without Hayes's input\"./nHayes advocated the establishment of a permanent cryptology cell within the armed forces. In 1946, Hayes wrote to the government, advising that \"it is to be hoped that the Irish army will never again face an emergency so ill-provided in this essential security device\"./nThroughout his time with G2, Richard Hayes continued to visit his office at the National Library every day.[7] He had joined the Library in 1923 and served as Director 1940\u201367.

Hoffman and William Meeks proved that any minimal surface which is contained in a half-space must fail to be properly immersed.[HM90] That is, there must exist a compact set in Euclidean space which contains a noncompact region of the minimal surface. The proof is a simple application of the maximum principle and unique continuation for minimal surfaces, based on comparison with a family of catenoids. This enhances a result of Meeks, Leon Simon, and Shing-Tung Yau, which states that any two complete and properly immersed minimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space, if both are nonplanar, either have a point of intersection or are separated from each other by a plane.[9] Hoffman and Meeks' result rules out the latter possibility.", "22381228": "E.

The influence of his translations on the development of medieval European astronomy was especially large./nHerman (also spelled Hermann) is known by several bynames in English and Latin referring to his land of origin or his ethnicity: Hermann of Carinthia[1] (Hermannus de Carinthia[2]); Hermann of Dalmatia[2] or Hermann the Dalmatian[3] (Hermannus Dalmata[4]); or Hermann the Slav[3] (Hermannus Sclavus[5]). Herman always refers to his homeland as Carinthia or Istria.[6] His own preferred nickname was Hermannus Secundus,[4] that is, the \"second Hermann\", by way of which he declared himself the successor of Hermannus Contractus, an earlier writer on the astrolabe.[7]/nThe main sources for Herman's life are the prologues to his own works.[8] These can be supplemented by a few references to him in the writings of his contemporaries.[9] In his own account, he was born in the early 12th century, possibly around 1105 or 1110, in central Istria, then part of the Duchy of Carinthia in the Holy Roman Empire.[10] The location is difficult to pin down given the much broader extent of the March of Istria in the 12th century, which included the Karst Plateau, Trieste, Duino and most of the area of later Inner Carniola, possibly even encompassing the upper Vipava Valley.[11] The term \"central Istria\" was likely used for all those (predominantly Slavic-inhabited) areas under the rule of the margrave of Istria, as opposed to the predominantly Romance-speaking coastal towns which lived under an autonomous municipal regime.[12]/nHerman most likely went to a Benedictine monastic school in Istria.[9] He subsequently studied under Thierry of Chartres, either at Paris or at Chartres, before 1138.[7] It is possible that he first met Robert of Ketton in Paris or Chartres.[9] Richard Hakluyt, quoting an anonymous Latin source from the time of the Second Crusade, says that Robert \"traveled through France, Italy, Dalmatia, and Greece, and came at last into Asia, where he lived in great danger of his life among the cruel Saracens, but yet learned perfectly the Arabian tongue\" and \"returned by sea into Spain\", adding that Herman \"had accompanied him in his long voyage.\"[13] This single passage has been elaborated with many conjectures by later historians, some having him pass through Constantinople on his way to Baghdad in 1135 and sojourning in Damascus in 1136\u20131138.[14]/nThe first securely datable event in Herman's life is his translation of Sahl ibn Bishr's Fatidica in 1138.[7] In fact, all his activities can be traced only for the period 1138\u20131143, when he was in Spain.[7][15]/nIn 1142 Herman was in Spain and became involved in a project to translate Islamic texts.\nPeter the Venerable recruited a team, including Herman, to translate five texts about Islam into Latin.  Different members of the team appear to have concentrated on different works, and Herman is credited as the main translator of two of them: De generatione Muhamet et nutritura eius and De doctrina Muhamet./nThe most significant translation in the collection was that of the Qur'an.  This was entitled Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete and was the first known translation of the Qur'an into a European language. Robert of Ketton was its principal translator, according to most sources (including the Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete itself). However, Herman may have had some input, given the team nature of the project.\nDespite being an imperfect translation, Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete remained the standard one for centuries, circulating in manuscript before being printed in the 1543 edition published in Basel by Theodor Bibliander. In this edition both Herman's above-mentioned translations of treatises about Islam appeared together with a preface by Martin Luther./nHerman also translated Ptolemy's Canon of Kings. For long many thought that Ptolemy was translated by German Herman Contractus and not by Herman of Carinthia./nHerman's first known translation was the sixth book of an astrological treatise Liber sextus astronomie by the Jewish writer  Sahl ibn Bishr.  It was released in Spain in 1138 under the title Zaelis fatidica (Prophesy).  Sahl ibn Bishr had been writing in the Greek astrological tradition. Ibn Bishr's first five books were preserved in the translation of John of Seville (Johannes Hispanus) (circa 1090 \u2013 circa 1150). The sixth book deals with three thematic topics regarding the influences on the world and its inhabitants. The work contains divinations based on the movements of the planets and comets./nCirca 1140 Herman translated into Latin the astronomical work of Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi Kitab al-madkhal ila ilm ahkam al nujum (Introduction to Astronomy).[16]  The work contains problems from Greek philosophy, Arabic astronomy and Eastern astrology, and was first translated into Latin by John of Seville in 1133.  Herman's less literal translation was published several times under the title Liber introductorius in astronomiam Albumasaris, Abalachii (Augusta Vindelicorum, Augsburg 1489; Venice 1495 and 1506). A large part of Herman's translation was copied into Roger of Hereford's Book of Astronomical Judgements./nHerman produced a version of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-\u1e34w\u0101rizm\u012b's astronomical tables (zij) \u2013 they were also translated in 1126 by Adelard of Bath (1075\u20131164)./nCharles Burnett (2001) postulates that Herman collaborated with Robert of Ketton and Hugo of Santalla on the Liber novem iudicum (the Book of Nine Judges), a collection of translations of Arabic astrologers, notably al-Kindi. Their project may have been to supplant the current superstitious Latin astrology with Arabic astronomical science. Arabic texts cite often Hermes as an authority. Burnett postulates that Renaissance magi merely continued this Hermetic tradition begun by Herman, Robert and Hugh. Herman shares technical terminology with Hugh and a penchant for evocation of the Asclepius, most notably in De essentiis (see below)/nHis original contribution to philosophy was De essentiis (On essences).[17] In this work Herman deals with five Aristotelian categories (causa, motus, spatium, tempus, habitudo).

Later, he took a position at Bell Laboratories to work on the chemistry of transistors.[4] He then worked as a research associate in medicine at the University of Minnesota, working on, among other things, fluorescence microscopy and liver perfusion. In 1955 and 1956, he published two papers in the journal Science criticizing the pseudoscientific claims of extrasensory perception.[5][6]/nContinuing with science journalism, Price tried to write a book titled No Easy Way about the United States' Cold War with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, but complained that \"the world kept changing faster than I could write about it\", and so the book was never finished./nFrom 1961 to 1967, Price was employed by IBM as a consultant on graphic data processing. In 1966, he was treated for thyroid cancer, but the operation to remove the tumour left his shoulder partially paralysed and left him reliant on thyroxine medication. With the money from his medical insurance, he moved to the United Kingdom to start a new life in November 1967./nW.D. Hamilton failed to recall when Price first contacted him, but says Price had read Hamilton's 1964 papers on kin selection,[7][8] and with no training in population genetics or statistics devised the Price equation,[9] a covariance equation that generated the change in allele frequency of a population.[10]  Although the first part of the equation had previously been derived by Alan Robertson[11] and C. C. Li,[12] its second component allowed it to be applied to all levels of selection, meiotic drive, traditional natural selection with an extension into inclusive fitness and group selection./nOn 6 June 1970,[4] Price had a religious experience and became an ardent scholar of the New Testament. He believed that there had been too many coincidences in his life. In particular, he wrote a lengthy essay titled The Twelve Days of Easter, arguing that the calendar of events surrounding Jesus of Nazareth's death in Easter Week was actually slightly longer. Later he turned away from Biblical scholarship and instead dedicated his life to community work, helping the needy of North London./nPrice developed a new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, the Price equation, which has now been accepted as the best interpretation of a formerly enigmatic result.[9]  He wrote what is still widely held to be the best mathematical, biological and evolutionary representation of altruism. He also pioneered the application of game theory to evolutionary biology, in a co-authored 1973 paper with John Maynard Smith.[13] Furthermore, Price reasoned that in the same way as an organism may sacrifice itself and further its genes (altruism) an organism may sacrifice itself to eliminate others of the same species if it enabled closely related organisms to better propagate their related genes. This negative altruism was described in a paper published by W. D. Hamilton and is termed Hamiltonian spite./nPrice's 'mathematical' theory of altruism reasons that organisms are more likely to show altruism toward each other as they become more genetically similar to each other. Thus, in a species that requires two parents to reproduce, an organism is most likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological parent, full sibling, or direct offspring. The reason for this is that each of these relatives' genetic makeup contains (on average in the case of siblings) 50% of the genes that are found in the original organism. So if the original organism dies as a result of an altruistic act it can still manage to propagate its full genetic heritage as long as two or more of these close relatives are saved. Consequently, an organism is less likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological grandparent, grandchild, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew or half-sibling (each carry one-fourth of the genes found in the original organism); and even less likely to show altruism to a first cousin (carrying one-eighth of the genes found in the original organism). The theory then asserts that the further genetically removed two organisms are from each other, the less likely they are to show altruism to each other./nPrice grew increasingly depressed by the implications of his equation. As part of an attempt to prove his theory right or wrong, he began showing an ever-increasing amount (in both quality and quantity) of random kindness to complete strangers. In this way, he dedicated the latter part of his life to helping the homeless, often inviting homeless people to live in his house. Sometimes, when the people in his house became a distraction, he slept in his office at the Galton Laboratory. He also gave up everything to help alcoholics; yet as he helped them steal his belongings, he increasingly fell into depression.[14][15]/nHe was eventually evicted from his rented house owing to a construction project in the area, making him unhappy because he could no longer provide housing for the homeless. He moved to various squats in the North London area, and became depressed over Christmas, 1974.[16]/nPossibly due to the long-term complications of his thyroid treatment,[1] Price committed suicide on January 6, 1975, by cutting his carotid artery with a pair of nail scissors. His body was identified by his close colleague, W.D. Hamilton.[17]/nA memorial service was held for Price in Euston. The only persons present from academia were Hamilton and Maynard Smith, the other few mourners being those who had come to know him through his community work. He is buried in St Pancras Cemetery.[18]/nPrice's contributions were largely overlooked for 20 years; he had worked in theoretical biology for only a short time and was not very thorough in publishing papers. This has changed in recent years. An article by James Schwartz published in 2000[19] was the beginning of the historical redress. In 2010, Oren Harman's LA Times Book Prize winning biography, The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness was published, and has received major attention, finally bringing Price and his story to the general public. A stage play about Price, The Altruists by Craig Baxter, won the fourth STAGE International Script Competition.[20] On 29 March 2016, Farnworth's play Calculating Kindness opened for a sold-out three-week run at the Camden People's Theatre.[21][22]/nThe Papers of George R Price are housed at the British Library.

Although obscure, he is considered a significant English fourteenth-century philosopher for his contributions to logic, natural philosophy, and physics. Dumbleton\u2019s masterwork is his Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis (Summary of Logic and Natural Philosophy), likely to have been composed just before the time of his death./nJohn of Dumbleton is recorded to have become a fellow at Merton College, Oxford (ca. 1338\u20139) and to have studied with the likes of William Heytesbury, Thomas Bradwardine, and Richard Swineshead. These four medieval scholastics held a common bond in that their study interests were in a similar field, but the method of study which brought these fellows into the same sphere of learning was of a more esoteric bent than modern university methods. They were interested in mathematics and logical analysis for the purposes of natural philosophy, theology, and an a priori type of mathematical physics (not to be confused with modern, empirical, experimental physics). Thus, the physics postulations and conjectures made by Dumbleton and his Oxford contemporaries were primarily done without any application of physical experimentation. Dumbleton, along with the other three Merton philosophers, received the moniker 'Calculators' for their adherence to mathematics and logical disputation when solving philosophical and theological problems.[1][2] After being named a fellow at The Queen's College, Oxford (1340) and making a return to Merton College (1344\u201345) Dumbleton is recorded to have studied theology in Paris (ca. 1345\u201347) for a brief period before returning to finish his studies at Merton College (1347\u20131348).[3]:\u200a253\u200a The fact that no extant copy of Dumbleton's Summa Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis is complete (nor edited) leads one to wonder if his death (ca. 1349) abruptly terminated the possibility of its completion./nThough there was a considerable reverence for Platonism in Oxford during the fourteenth century, the rebirth of Aristotelianism held sway in the higher Parisian learning circuits. Dumbleton, who studied in Paris for a brief time, was not immune to this spell. In fact, his compendium Summa Logica et Philosophiae Naturalis, has an overview of many principles found in Aristotle's Physics. The Summa is broken into ten different sections. The ninth section is uncompleted in all extant manuscripts. The tenth section, which, according to Dumbleton, was supposed to examine \"universals and signification,\" shows no evidence of ever being worked on.[3]:\u200a254\u200a Although this is the case, the other sections of Dumbleton's Summa are filled with medieval philosophical gems. A couple emphasized topics to be found in the first section are \"certitude and the psychology of logic.\"[3]:\u200a253\u200a It includes a medieval examination of epistemological issues; such as the certainty of knowledge. A strong Aristotelian appreciation is felt in the remaining sections, since the majority of the work is dedicated to commenting on the first eight chapters of Aristotle's Physics, and his treatises On Generation and Corruption & On the Soul. In those sections of the Summa will be found discussions and commentary on such topics as: alteration, change (i.e., the measure of motion), properties of natural bodies and their forms (parts II and III); questions dealing with classification (e.g., \"whether light belongs to some element\";[3]:\u200a253\u200a motions and changes of bodies/forms (parts IV\u00a0\u2013 VI); and in the final sections an examination of the intellect and matters of the soul (parts VII\u00a0\u2013 IX).[3]:\u200a253\u20134\u200a It is difficult to assess why Dumbleton's Summa did not have a significant following, but it may have been because it was never completed or that it was not circulated well enough./nThe four Merton \u2018Calculators\u2019 were not only well versed in the current issues of philosophy during the fourteenth century; they actually initiated new groundbreaking scientific postulations. John of Dumbleton was no exception. Because he concurred with many of the positions held by William Ockham (1288\u20131348)\u2014especially the idea that is commonly referred to as Ockham\u2019s razor, which states that the most simplistic explanations are ideal\u2014he may have learned how to succinctly formulate his scientific conjectures./nOf Dumbleton\u2019s many scientific theories there is one in particular that is worth mentioning here. By making the assumption that bodies are finite, Dumbleton was able to conjecture that contraction or expansion, as in cases of condensation or rarefaction, does not eliminate any parts of a body; rather, a \u201cdenumerable number of parts\u201d always exists.[4] Though the idea of molecules was not theorized at this time, Dumbleton\u2019s speculation helped to tame the view that bodies have infinitely divisible parts./nDumbleton was one of the first to express functional relationships in graphical form. He gave a proof of the mean speed theorem stating that \"the latitude of a uniformly difform movement corresponds to the degree of the midpoint\" and used this method to study the quantitative decrease in intensity of illumination, stating that it was not linearly proportional to the distance, but was unable to expose the Inverse-square law, which was postponed nearly 250 years until its discovery by Johannes Kepler in 1604.[5]/nIt is difficult to determine what methodology the Oxford 'Calculators' used when they were conjecturing and postulating theorems by way of abstraction (i.e., without empirical investigation). This criticism is not expressly made toward Dumbleton's conjectures but more broadly aimed at the methodology of the whole group of Mertonian physicists. One suggestion is that they may have been trying to create a mathematical picture of the Aristotelian world-view. If this were true, it would show why empirical investigation was not their modus operandi. In other words, the Oxford Calculators' works show respect for quantitative reasoning; opposed to a posteriori evaluations. Regardless of whether they opted against empirical investigation for theological reasons or simply because the debut of the scientific method was not ready to be revealed, one ought to regard John of Dumbleton and his contemporaries as exemplary pioneers in mathematics, physics, and logical discourse.", "39748314": "Surindar Kumar Trehan (S.K.

He was a theoretical physicist.  He was a pioneer in 19th-century Greek physics.  He helped develop the physics department at the University of Athens.  He was the dean.  He did extensive research in the field of physics namely: the study of air and energy fields,  electricity, magnetism, and telephones.  He also studied the motion of molecules and developed a system of scientific observation.  He developed the Strombo compass.[1]  His contemporaries at the time were Greek scientists Vassilios Lakon, Georgios Konstantinos Vouris, and Ioannis Papadakis.  He was replaced as the chair of the physics department by his student world-renowned physicist Timoleon Argyropoulos after his death.[2][3][4]/nDimitrios was born in Koukouli, Ioannina.  He was part of a very important family.  The family eventually migrated to Corfu.  Both Dimitrios and his brother were educated overseas.  Dimitrios attended two prestigious institutions in Europe.  He attended the University of Geneva and the \u00c9cole polytechnique.  He was inspired by Henri Victor Regnault.  He eventually moved back to Greece and became part of the University of Athens.  He was also an instructor at   \nEvelpidon.  He was part of the movement to eradicate the religious suppression of science.  The Christian religion surpassed new scientific ideas for hundreds of years within the Greek community.  A notable incident was the Methodios Affair.  Dimitrios represented the dawn of a new era of scientific thought in Greece.  He researched and promoted every new physics idea and kept open communication with all the prominent European scientists at the time.[5][6]/nDimitrios was born in 1806 in the village of Koukouli, Ioannina.  His grandfather was Konstantinos.  He was a very wealthy Greek merchant from Koukouli, Ioannina. Konstantinos had two children Stefanos and Georgios.  Dimitri's father was Stefanos.  His uncle was Georgios.  Dimitrios completed his basic education in Ioannina.  His teacher was prominent educator Athanassios Sakellarios.  The family moved to Patras after the Greek War of Independence in 1830.  Dimitrios and his brother Petros Stroumbos studied at the Ionian Academy.  Ioannis Kapodistrias sent Dimitrios and Petros to study in Europe on a scholarship from the Greek government.   Dimitrios studied mathematics and physics his brother studied law.[7]  Dimitrios initially studied physics at the University of Geneva in Switzerland and  he also traveled to Paris to study at the \u00c9cole polytechnique.[8][9]  Records indicate he was at the \u00c9cole polytechnique in 1829 and 1852 indicating that he continued to advance his education with the evolving technologies of the time.  Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re and Joseph Fourier were notable faculty associated with the institution at the time. Notable students attending the prestigious school while Dimitrios was at the institution were: Henri Victor Regnault, Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand, Auguste Bravais and Herv\u00e9 Faye.  Dimitrios graduated with a Phd with the highest honors.  He returned to Athens in 1838 and began work at  Evelpidon.  He also became a professor at the newly founded University of Athens.  He was an adjunct professor from 1839-1844 and full professor from 1844-1890.[4][10]/nThe newly founded monarchy was full of problems.  There was constant friction between the rebels that founded the new state and King Otto.  The palace of the king was completed and a huge rebellion ensued known as the Rebellion of the 3rd of September in 1843.  The rebels demanded a constitutional monarchy and the departure of the Bavarian officials.  The university played a vital role in politics since its inception.  Stroumpos and other faculty members were constantly dragged into the political debate.  Higher education played a crucial role in politics.  Regrettably, one of the most important Greek-Austrian astronomers Georgios Konstantinos Vouris was sent back to Austria due to the political uncertainty and his association with the Kings motherland during the 1850s.  Dimitrios was named the dean of the  University of Athens from 1858 to 1859.  During this time his grade school teacher Athanassios Sakellarios received a Phd from the University.[4]/nHe gave a notable speech in September 1858.  Stroumpos gave an incredible speech outlining the importance of modern scientific advancement.  Early in his speech he discussed Francis Bacon, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newtown.  The three scientists formed the basis of his scientific knowledge.  He saw them as heroes that were persecuted and unrecognized.  He criticized the church's persecution of scientific education for hundreds of years and corydalism.  He also emphasized the importance of following the modern scientific advancements of the time.  He discussed the work of his classmate Henri Victor Regnault.  He also named the academic research of Edmond Becquerel and Michael Faraday.  He also equated Michael Faraday to the genius of sir Isaac Newton.  Towards the end of his historic speech he made six points about scientific advancement a) sciences independence from religion was crucial, b) he stressed the importance of experimental method, c) the search for truth, d) investigation on how the world was created, he was inline with darwins theory of evolution, e) scientists should search for natural laws to explain all phenomena, and f) special theories or hypotheses should be established to explain all phenomena.[4][11]/nOn May 10, 1859, a political incident called the skiadika (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac) occurred involving students of the University and Stroumbos.  By October 1862, King Otto was exiled to never return to Greece.  By the late 1860s, his student was Greek physicist Timoleon Argyropoulos.  He decided to study in France following the path of Stroumpos.  Stroumpos was in constant communication with the international scientific community namely France.  He was constantly publishing research articles in different periodicals.  In the 1880s he invented an instrument for measuring magnetic declination and inclination known as the stroumbo compass.[12]  He did extensive research on Archimedes' principle and air.  He also introduced new European concepts to Greek higher education.  He studied the weights of objects.  He did extensive research on the function of levers. He used atwood's machine to demonstrate classical mechanics.  He theorized that static electricity directly produces the same effect as dynamic electricity, without the intervention of any electric current.[13]  He researched the works of Wilhelm Holtz namely dealing with electric machines.  He also studied the electromagnetism and refraction of light.  He was part of the rise of the wave theory of light and optical theory.  He wrote countless books and articles on different physical processes.  By now Greek scientists began to utilize the mathematical interpretation of the physical world and contributed to the founding of modern physics.[4]  He died in Athens on February 5, 1890.[14][15]", "27001600": "Sankara Narayana (c. 840 \u2013 c. 900 AD) was an Indian astronomer-mathematician in the court of Ravi Kulasekhara (c. 844 \u2013 c. 883 AD) of the Chera Perumal kingdom of Kerala.[1][2] He is best known as the author of Laghu Bhaskariya Vivarana or Vyakha (869/870 AD), a detailed commentary on treatise Laghu Bhaskariya by 7th century mathematician Bhaskara I (which in turn was based on the works of the 5th century polymath Aryabhata).[3][4] Sankara Narayana is known to have established an astronomical observatory at the port of Kodungallur in central Kerala.[2][5]/nLaghu Bhaskariya Vivarana (Chapter VII), produced in the court of king Ravi Kulasekhara at Kodungallur, explicitly states that it was composed in Saka Year 791 (=869/70 AD).[4][1] It is also mentions that the year was the 25th regnal year of king Ravi Kulasekhara.[6] In the second verse of the vivarana Narayana remembers five major precessors in the field of mathematics (Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Bhaskara I, Govinda and Haridatta), including his possible master Govinda (c. 800 \u2013 c. 860 AD).[6]/n\"Oh [king] Ravi Varma Deva, now deign to tell us quickly, reading off from the armillary sphere installed [at the observatory] in Mahodayapura, duly fitted with all the relevant circles and with the sign (degree-minute) markings, the time of the rising point of the ecliptic (lagna) when the Sun is at 10\u00b0 in the sign of Capricorn, and also when the Sun is at the end of the sign Libra, which I have noted.\"[8]/n\"Sa Sthanurjayati trirupasahito lingepi lokarcitah\"./n\"Angartvambara nanda devamanubhir yate dinanam ganeGraste tigma mayukhamalinitamobhute parahne diviPrsta praggrahanad dvitiyaghatika grasa pramanam raverBharta sri Kulasekharena vilasad velavrtaya bhuva\"./n\"Evam Sakabdah punariha candra randhramuni sankhyaya asambhiravagatah\"./n\"Capapravista guru sauri samatva kalamYamyottaram gamanamantaratah pramanamAcaksvya sarvamavagamya bhatoktamargadItyuktavan ravirasena nrpabhivandya\".\"Tada pancavimsati Varsanyatitani devasya\".", "2065156": "Claude Mydorge (1585 \u2013 July 1647) was a French mathematician.

He argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed, and thus no one can have direct access to reality, given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality. His best known dictum is \"The map is not the territory\"./nBorn in Warsaw, Vistula Country, which was then part of the Russian Empire, Korzybski belonged to an aristocratic Polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for generations. He learned the Polish language at home and the Russian language in schools, and having a French and German governess, he became fluent in four languages as a child./nKorzybski studied engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology. During the First World War (1914\u20131918) Korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the Russian Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he moved to North America in 1916 (first to Canada, then to the United States) to coordinate the shipment of artillery to Russia. He also lectured to Polish-American audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of war bonds. After the war he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1940. He met Mira Edgerly,[4] a painter of portraits on ivory, shortly after the 1918 Armistice; They married in January 1919; the marriage lasted until his death./nE. P. Dutton published Korzybski's first book, Manhood of Humanity, in 1921. In this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a \"time-binding\" class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which become accreted in cultures).\nIn 1925 and 1926, Korzybski observed psychiatric patients at St. Elizabeth's hospital in D.C. under the supervision of William Alanson White.[5]/nKorzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics (GS). This should not be confused with semantics. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication Science and Sanity, published in 1933. In 1938, Korzybski founded the Institute of General Semantics in Chicago.[6] The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the institute's building lease, so in 1946 he moved the institute to Lakeville, Connecticut, U.S., where he directed it until his death in 1950./nKorzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the structure of their languages. Humans cannot experience the world directly, but only through their \"abstractions\" (nonverbal impressions or \"gleanings\" derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). These sometimes mislead us about what is the truth. Our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening./nHe sought to train our awareness of abstracting, using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, \"consciousness of abstracting\". His system included the promotion of attitudes such as \"I don't know; let's see,\" in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science. Another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience he termed, \"silence on the objective levels\"./nMany devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form \"is\" of the general verb \"to be.\"[7] His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different \"orders of abstraction,\" and formulations such as \"consciousness of abstracting.\" The contention that Korzybski opposed the use of the verb \"to be\" would be a profound exaggeration./nHe thought that certain uses of the verb \"to be\", called the \"is of identity\" and the \"is of predication\", were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, \"Elizabeth is a fool\" (said of a person named \"Elizabeth\" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to deny identity; in this example, to be aware continually that \"Elizabeth\" is not what we call her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, \"the map is not the territory\". Note that this premise uses the phrase \"is not\", a form of \"to be\"; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon \"to be\" as such. In fact, he said explicitly[citation needed] that there were no structural problems with the verb \"to be\" when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb \"to be,\" as long as one was aware of their structural limitations./nOne day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. \"Nice biscuit, don't you think,\" said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words \"Dog Cookies.\" The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. \"You see,\" Korzybski remarked, \"I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.\"[8]/nWilliam Burroughs went to a Korzybski workshop in the autumn of 1939.

Hayakawa (later to become a Republican member of the U.S. Senate) and Wendell Johnson (founder of the Monster Study).[9]/nKorzybski's work received  positive reactions from a variety of individuals in the 1940s and 1950s.[10] Robert A. Heinlein named a character after him in his 1940 short story \"Blowups Happen\", and science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt in his novel \"The World of Null-A\", published in 1948.   On March 8, 1949,  fellow science-fiction author L.

Got to thinking about it other day. The system is Excalibur. It makes nul A's.[11]/nKorzybski's ideas influenced philosopher Alan Watts who used his phrase \"the map is not the territory\" in lectures. Writer Robert Anton Wilson was also deeply influenced by Korzybski's ideas./nAs reported in the third edition of Science and Sanity, in World War II the US Army used Korzybski's system to treat battle fatigue in Europe, under the supervision of Dr. Douglas M.

During COVID-19, O'Neale created mathematical models to build understanding of how the network of interractions of the virus was spread, and during this period, was a frequent commentator in the New Zealand media about the country's response to the pandemic. He is a senior lecturer in physics at Auckland University, principal investigator at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini and Project Lead of COVID-19 Modelling Aotearoa./nBorn in New Zealand, O'Neale studied at the University of Auckland between 1999 and 2003, graduating with a BSc in physics, BA in mathematics and BSc with honours in applied mathematics. He completed his MSc at Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf in 2005, and PhD at Massey University in 2009.[1] O'Neale was a postdoctoral research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia from August 2009 until April 2010, when he returned to New Zealand and joined the Applied Mathematics team at Industrial Research Limited, later known as Callaghan Innovation, in Lower Hutt, where he worked as a research scientist until 2013 when he became a research fellow and later lecturer with the department of physics at Auckland University. As of 2022 O'Neale continues in that role and since 2015 has been a principal investigator at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini.[2][3][4] O'Neale has taken lead roles in several New Zealand government-funded research projects and in 2021 became the project lead for a programme called COVID-19 Modelling Aotearoa which initially arose under the leadership of Te P\u016bnaha Matatini but is now a standalone project hosted by the University of Auckland.[5]/n/nO'Neale was part of a team led by Michael Baker and funded in 2020 by the Health Research Council of New Zealand(HRC) for a 3-year research project: COVID-19 Pandemic in Aotearoa NZ: Impact, Inequalities & Improving our response. The goal of the project was to provide insights to the New Zealand Ministry of Health about how the virus was likely to severely affect people with existing health conditions and less able to afford health care.  The application noted that Maori and Pasifika were disproportionately represented in this group so the response in New Zealand needed to be \"effective and fair....[and the researchers undertook to]... communicate these insights to decision-makers at the Ministry of Health, service providers, communities, other Pacific nations, and the public in the form of practical recommendations to guide current and future pandemic responses\".[6]/nAnother funded programme led by O'Neale, Te matatini o te horapa: a population-based contagion network for Aotearoa NZ, undertook to build a model to simulate how COVID-19 could spread on contact networks, [by] \"explicitly including individual demographic and economic attributes in the model..[and]...provide policy advice about vulnerability, what factors lead to increased risk, and what effective and equitable interventions would be. These ranged from behavioural changes and social support measures, to mitigate factors which [increased] transmission risk and inequities\".[7]/nA paper co-authored by O'Neale and provided initially to officials on 16 November 2020, looked at modelling which possible non-pharmaceutical interventions would lead to elimination of COVID-19 if a case - not connected to the border - was found in the community. The study suggested that effective behaviours \u2013 other than testing and contract tracing \u2013 to improve the chances of possible elimination included increased levels of control in workplaces and the closing of schools. These findings were based on simulations of combination of multiple control measures and allowed \"transmission routes via both 'close' and 'casual' contacts within each infection context, each with specific intervention-dependent reductions in transmission rate\".[8]/nBy 2021, the COVID-19 Modelling Aotearoa programme was established with funding initially from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, later the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and as 2022, from the Manat\u016b Hauora Ministry of Health. O'Neale is a Project Lead for Contagion Network Modelling within this programme.[5] COVID-19 Modelling Aotearoa aimed at helping policy makers in developing responses to COVID-19 during a possible major outbreak in New Zealand, by \"bringing together the multiple realms of public data collected for the census and from other public sources, and overlaying that with a COVID contagion model developed to represent both disease progression and interventions such as contact tracing and testing and the announcement and timing of Alert Levels\". O'Neale explained that this mathematical approach originated in materials science and physics but had been previously applied to the epidemiology of disease when models were developed during the spread of Ebola in Africa. He said that the model had been useful during the lockdown of Auckland in August 2020 because it modelled the risk of a spread outside of the city and predicted the outcome if there was a change in the response.  O'Neale's conclusion was that \"the model proved spot on, offering politicians a degree of confidence on which to base their decisions\".[9]/nIn February 2021, the team at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini developed an \"individual-based network contagion model\" representing the population of New Zealand and the contexts in which they interracted, to \"address the question of whether Alert Level 2.5 (AL2.5) [was] enough to eliminate a community outbreak with no clear epidemiological link to the border \u2013 like that seen in the 2020 Auckland August outbreak\". The paper noted that the size of the outbreak at the beginning of a possible outbreak would affect the probability of elimination as would the impact of contact tracing, but concluded from the results of the simulation, that a move to Alert level 2.5 was unlikely to lead to elimination in a scenario similar to the 2020 outbreak in Auckland.[10]/nA report compiled in September 2021 and delivered on 17 August 2021, used the individual-based network contagion model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in the community, considering a \"case of community transmission with no link to the border....[on the assumption that]...each simulation was seeded by setting the state to infected (specifically to 'Exposed') for a single, randomly selected, individual in Auckland...[and]...around 15% of individuals over the age of 15 have been vaccinated\".[11] As Auckland responded to the outbreak of COVID-19, O'Neale contributed to a report delivered on 10 September 2021, that considered the consequence of reconnecting during transitions between phases and changes in Alert Level restrictions. The researchers used a network representing New Zealand, Populated Aotearoa Interaction Network (PAIN),to illustrate the number of interactions between people.  The report found that only a \"small increase in the number of connections between individuals from different dwellings (an increase from around 10% to around 20% of the number expected at Alert Level 1) was sufficient to increase the size of the largest connected component of the population who could be reached though transmission by a factor of 15; from around 90,000 to over 1.4\u00a0million...[highlighting]...the fact that New Zealand [was] a complex and highly connected system, where individuals [were] typically not too far removed from each other...[suggesting that]... Alert Levels, and specifically lock downs, work because they reduce the vast majority of interactions within the community and limit chains of potential transmission\".[12] By October 2021, the research team had used the model to estimate the effects of a proposed change in the response of the New Zealand Government to COVID-19 by developing a simulation of a community outbreak of the Delta variant detected in Auckland on 17 August 2021. The results indicated that without making any changes to the alert levels, there should be a \"zero case day around the beginning of October, but that a zero case day [was] unlikely in the near term at lower levels of intervention\".[13]/nWhen the New Zealand Government announced in October 2021 that senior students would be able to return to high schools within Level 3 of the response to COVID-19, O'Neale agreed with some members of the education sector that it would to pose a risk for increasing case numbers, noting that the modelling suggested \"most of the extra infections from schools reopening will actually show up in non-school contexts as a result of students subsequently infecting other people in their households or in other community interactions\".[14] He acknowledged that there was a strategy by the government to improve ventilation in schools and have a mask mandate, and recommended supporting these measures by bringing in rapid antigen testing.[15][16]/nAs Omicron cases were detected at the border in late 2021, O'Neale noted that most future infections would be this variant and likely to leak out into the community,[17] later warning that New Zealand should get prepared for a 'skyrocketing' in case numbers as happened in New South Wales which had similar rates of vaccination to New Zealand. He said in the interview that summer had meant schools were closed, people were on holiday and there were more outdoor activities which reduced transmissibility,  but \"the number of cases were likely to creep up once the immunity provided by the vaccine started to wane a little and people returned to work and schools\".[18] O'Neale said at this time that the numbers of COVID-19 cases could double every three days and modellers were making their predictions based on most of the cases being the Omicron variant which had a fast incubation period and would grow faster than Delta.[19]/nThe New Zealand media reported on 14 February 2022, that the government was about to make a change in its approach to managing Omicron due to growing numbers of cases. O'Neale suggested this change was an acknowledgement that systems to manage the virus needed to change and the plan to shorten home isolation periods and good contact tracing for high risk cases was less restrictive than under previous levels.[20]/nOn 16 February 2022, after a slight drop in numbers of cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand, O'Neale was one of modellers at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini who said that reported case numbers were doubling roughly every three days, with a possible tally in the community of around 4000 before the end of February. O'Neale  explained the lag effect that meant a daily case number was often of cases reported more than a week previously. The modellers predicted a possible wave of three-to-four months, and with low transmission and a high rate of uptake of the booster vaccine, there could be \"1.5m infections of which 386,400 were reported as cases\" with numbers increasing if booster rates were low and transmission high\".[21] He later confirmed that the case numbers most likely reflected a backlog that had built up over the past week, a time he described as having \"very noisy data due to data processing and testing systems being a bit up and down\". O'Neale maintained that a peak in numbers was likely in mid to late March 2022.[22]/nThe issue of COVID-19 spreading widely amongst young people in New Zealand was explained by O'Neale on 27 February 2022 as being expected in the \"early stages of an outbreak...[because]...younger people, much more mobile and tending to go out a lot more and also tending to get symptoms at lower rates and so less likely to be tested, less likely to know they're infected, less likely to be isolating\".[23]/nO'Neale clarified the importance of New Zealanders getting the booster vaccine shot to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant early in 2022,[24] and said data from the UK had shown that after a booster, there was an increase of 20 percent effectiveness against infection to 60 percent.[25] He later agreed with Helen Petousis-Harris and Michael Baker that David Seymour was not following the evidence by suggesting at the time that vaccine mandates could be removed.  O'Neale said that having a booster dose remained the most effective way to protect against hospitalisations, and \"asking people with high exposure risk due to their work to be vaccinated still [benefitted] the community\".[26]/nAfter the New Zealand Government announced a roadmap to ease restrictions in the country on 21 February 2022, O'Neale predicted high case numbers as more people became exposed to Omicron, but ultimately it was how people behaved and high levels of booster vaccine uptake, saying that the government were being  pragmatic in waiting until easing restrictions.[27] When a journalist claimed at the time, that the New Zealand Government had accelerated the rate of the outbreak, O'Neale worried that the Government was \"burying its head in the sand a little bit\". According to O'Neale, the Government, being apparently comfortable in believing the country could weather the outbreak, was \"misguided from an outbreak control perspective...[although]...it may well be that Omicron peaks and subsides without unduly burdening the health system\".[28] While another intended change at the time to shortened isolation periods was seen as necessary by some businesses, O'Neale explained that a shorter isolation period would increase the risk of the virus spreading more quickly, but was unlikely to have a \"huge benefit in returning essential workers to the workforce, given there's been such incredibly wide uptake of businesses opting in to this essential worker classification\".[29] O'Neale agreed with updating the advice to encourage the wearing of higher quality masks to reduce airborne transmission, but was cautious about people eating and drinking inside and not wearing masks.[30] Retaining COVID-19 pre-departure tests for overseas visitors was also seen by O'Neale as the correct approach at the time for New Zealand, despite some countries having done away with them. Reasons he gave for retaining these tests included preventing a rise in infection numbers due to travellers entering the country and possibly stalling the arrival of variants.[31]/nBy March 2022, when Omicron had caused a major spike in daily cases, O'Neale urged New Zealanders to continue declaring test results so modellers could have confidence in the numbers they were putting out,[32] as they needed data other than hospitalisation rates which were late on the \"disease progression pipeline\".[33] With numbers of infections continuing to rise, predictions were made early in April 2022 by O'Neale that Auckland was likely to be in the \"tail of infections, while other regions were still closer to their peak\", and with an expected drop in case numbers after this, there could be \"about 5000 new cases per day for the whole country if all the regions...managed to reach that plateau at the same time\".[34]/nWhen New Zealand recorded more than one million cases of COVID-19 on the 10 May 2022, O'Neale and other modellers said that was an underestimation of infections, which were more likely to have been around three million. O'Neale noted this presented \"challenges for New Zealand down the line \u2013 making it more difficult to predict subsequent waves, reinfection rates, or the burden of long Covid\".[35]/nAs New Zealand entered the Christmas holiday period in 2022 and it looked likely that COVID-19 numbers would increase, O'Neale as Co-lead of the Network Contagion Modelling programme at Auckland University, said that even though the pathogen might not be as serious as earlier ones, there could be bigger impacts on the health system as the modelling was suggesting one in 20 people could get the infection. He noted as many as 30 to 40 percent of infections were asymptomatic, and recommended people take rapid antigen tests as a precaution before going to social events or visiting people who were vulnerable.[36]/nO'Neale was part of the team at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini that was awarded the 2020 Prime Minister's Science Prize in recognition of their work in developing data-based mathematical models to inform the New Zealand's response to COVID-19.[48] Diane Abad-Vergara[49] from the World Health Organization, said that the work done by P\u016bnaha Matatini \"had significant health and social impacts for New Zealand...[and was]...part of the reason why New Zealand [was] one of the few countries to eliminate the virus.\"[50]", "53576479": "The Honourable Nicholas Michael John Woodhouse CBE (born 27 February 1949) is a British mathematician.

He is commonly known for Occam's razor, the methodological principle that bears his name, and also produced significant works on logic, physics and theology. William is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on the 10th of April.[13]/nWilliam of Ockham was born in Ockham, Surrey, in 1287.[14] He received his elementary education in the London House of the Greyfriars.[15] It is believed that he then studied theology at the University of Oxford[5][6] from 1309 to 1321,[16] but while he completed all the requirements for a master's degree in theology, he was never made a regent master.[17] Because of this he acquired the honorific title Venerabilis Inceptor, or \"Venerable Beginner\" (an inceptor was a student formally admitted to the ranks of teachers by the university authorities).[18]/nDuring the Middle Ages, theologian Peter Lombard's Sentences (1150) had become a standard work of theology, and many ambitious theological scholars wrote commentaries on it.[19] William of Ockham was among these scholarly commentators. However, William's commentary was not well received by his colleagues, or by the Church authorities.[20] In 1324, his commentary was condemned as unorthodox by a synod of bishops,[citation needed] and he was ordered to Avignon, France, to defend himself before a papal court.[19]/nAn alternative understanding, recently proposed by George Knysh, suggests that he was initially appointed in Avignon as a professor of philosophy in the Franciscan school, and that his disciplinary difficulties did not begin until 1327.[21] It is generally believed that these charges were levied by Oxford chancellor John Lutterell.[22][23] The Franciscan Minister General, Michael of Cesena, had been summoned to Avignon, to answer charges of heresy. A theological commission had been asked to review his Commentary on the Sentences, and it was during this that William of Ockham found himself involved in a different debate. Michael of Cesena had asked William to review arguments surrounding Apostolic poverty. The Franciscans believed that Jesus and his apostles owned no property either individually or in common, and the Rule of Saint Francis commanded members of the order to follow this practice.[24] This brought them into conflict with Pope John XXII./nBecause of the pope's attack on the Rule of Saint Francis, William of Ockham, Michael of Cesena and other leading Franciscans fled Avignon on 26 May 1328, and eventually took refuge in the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Bavaria, who was also engaged in dispute with the papacy, and became William's patron.[19] After studying the works of John XXII and previous papal statements, William agreed with the Minister General. In return for protection and patronage William wrote treatises that argued for Emperor Louis to have supreme control over church and state in the Holy Roman Empire.[19] \"On June 6, 1328, William was officially excommunicated for leaving Avignon without permission,\"[17] and William argued that John XXII was a heretic for attacking the doctrine of Apostolic poverty and the Rule of Saint Francis, which had been endorsed by previous popes.[17] William of Ockham's philosophy was never officially condemned as heretical.[17]/nHe spent much of the remainder of his life writing about political issues, including the relative authority and rights of the spiritual and temporal powers. After Michael of Cesena's death in 1342, William became the leader of the small band of Franciscan dissidents living in exile with Louis IV. William of Ockham died (prior to the outbreak of the plague) on 9 April 1347.[25]/nIn scholasticism, William of Ockham advocated reform in both method and content, the aim of which was simplification. William incorporated much of the work of some previous theologians, especially Duns Scotus. From Duns Scotus, William of Ockham derived his view of divine omnipotence, his view of grace and justification, much of his epistemology[citation needed] and ethical convictions.[26] However, he also reacted to and against Scotus in the areas of predestination, penance, his understanding of universals, his formal distinction ex parte rei (that is, \"as applied to created things\"), and his view of parsimony which became known as Occam's razor./nWilliam of Ockham espoused fideism, stating that \"only faith gives us access to theological truths. The ways of God are not open to reason, for God has freely chosen to create a world and establish a way of salvation within it apart from any necessary laws that human logic or rationality can uncover.\"[27] He believed that science was a matter of discovery and saw God as the only ontological necessity.[17] His importance is as a theologian with a strongly developed interest in logical method, and whose approach was critical rather than system building.[28]/nWilliam of Ockham was a pioneer of nominalism, and some consider him the father of modern epistemology, because of his strongly argued position that only individuals exist, rather than supra-individual universals, essences, or forms, and that universals are the products of abstraction from individuals by the human mind and have no extra-mental existence.[29] He denied the real existence of metaphysical universals and advocated the reduction of ontology./nWilliam of Ockham is sometimes considered an advocate of conceptualism rather than nominalism, for whereas nominalists held that universals were merely names, i.e. words rather than extant realities, conceptualists held that they were mental concepts, i.e. the names were names of concepts, which do exist, although only in the mind. Therefore, the universal concept has for its object, not a reality existing in the world outside us, but an internal representation which is a product of the understanding itself and which \"supposes\" in the mind the things to which the mind attributes it; that is, it holds, for the time being, the place of the things which it represents. It is the term of the reflective act of the mind. Hence the universal is not a mere word, as Roscelin taught, nor a sermo, as Peter Abelard held, namely the word as used in the sentence, but the mental substitute for real things, and the term of the reflective process. For this reason William has sometimes also been called a \"Terminist\", to distinguish him from a nominalist or a conceptualist.[30]/nWilliam of Ockham was a theological voluntarist who believed that if God had wanted to, he could have become incarnate as a donkey or an ox, or even as both a donkey and a man at the same time. He was criticized for this belief by his fellow theologians and philosophers.[31]/nOne important contribution that he made to modern science and modern intellectual culture was efficient reasoning with the principle of parsimony in explanation and theory building that came to be known as Occam's razor. This maxim, as interpreted by Bertrand Russell,[32] states that if one can explain a phenomenon without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it, i.e. that one should always opt for an explanation in terms of the fewest possible causes, factors, or variables. He turned this into a concern for ontological parsimony; the principle says that one should not multiply entities beyond necessity\u2014Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate\u2014although this well-known formulation of the principle is not to be found in any of William's extant writings.[33] He formulates it as: \"For nothing ought to be posited without a reason given, unless it is self-evident (literally, known through itself) or known by experience or proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture.\"[34] For William of Ockham, the only truly necessary entity is God; everything else is contingent. He thus does not accept the principle of sufficient reason, rejects the distinction between essence and existence, and opposes the Thomistic doctrine of active and passive intellect. His scepticism to which his ontological parsimony request leads appears in his doctrine that human reason can prove neither the immortality of the soul; nor the existence, unity, and infinity of God. These truths, he teaches, are known to us by revelation alone.[30]/nWilliam wrote a great deal on natural philosophy, including a long commentary on Aristotle's Physics.[35] According to the principle of ontological parsimony, he holds that we do not need to allow entities in all ten of Aristotle's categories; we thus do not need the category of quantity, as the mathematical entities are not \"real\". Mathematics must be applied to other categories, such as the categories of substance or qualities, thus anticipating modern scientific renaissance while violating Aristotelian prohibition of metabasis./nIn the theory of knowledge, William rejected the scholastic theory of species, as unnecessary and not supported by experience, in favour of a theory of abstraction. This was an important development in late medieval epistemology. He also distinguished between intuitive and abstract cognition; intuitive cognition depends on the existence or non-existence of the object, whereas abstractive cognition \"abstracts\" the object from the existence predicate. Interpreters are, as yet, undecided about the roles of these two types of cognitive activities.[36]/nWilliam of Ockham is also increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of Western constitutional ideas, especially those of government with limited responsibility.[37] He was one of the first medieval authors to advocate a form of church/state separation,[37] and was important for the early development of the notion of property rights. His political ideas are regarded as \"natural\" or \"secular\", holding for a secular absolutism.[37] The views on monarchical accountability espoused in his Dialogus (written between 1332 and 1347)[38] greatly influenced the Conciliar movement and assisted in the emergence of democratic ideologies.[citation needed]/nWilliam argued for complete separation of spiritual rule and earthly rule.[39] He thought that the pope and churchmen have no right or grounds at all for secular rule like having property, citing 2 Timothy 2:4. That belongs solely to earthly rulers, who may also accuse the pope of crimes, if need be.[40]/nAfter the Fall God had given men, including non-Christians, two powers: private ownership and the right to set their rulers, who should serve the interest of the people, not some special interests. Thus he preceded Thomas Hobbes in formulating social contract theory along with earlier scholars.[40]/nWilliam of Ockham said that the Franciscans avoided both private and common ownership by using commodities, including food and clothes, without any rights, with mere usus facti, the ownership still belonging to the donor of the item or to the pope. Their opponents such as Pope John XXII wrote that use without any ownership cannot be justified: \"It is impossible that an external deed could be just if the person has no right to do it.\"[40]/nThus the disputes on the heresy of Franciscans led William of Ockham and others to formulate some fundamentals of economic theory and the theory of ownership.[40]/nIn logic, William of Ockham wrote down in words the formulae that would later be called De Morgan's laws,[41] and he pondered ternary logic, that is, a logical system with three truth values; a concept that would be taken up again in the mathematical logic of the 19th and 20th centuries. His contributions to semantics, especially to the maturing theory of supposition, are still studied by logicians.[42][43] William of Ockham was probably the first logician to treat empty terms in Aristotelian syllogistic effectively; he devised an empty term semantics that exactly fit the syllogistic. Specifically, an argument is valid according to William's semantics if and only if it is valid according to Prior Analytics.[44]/nWilliam of Ockham denied papal infallibility and often went into conflict with the pope.[45] As a result, some theologians have viewed him as a proto protestant.[46] However despite his conflicts with the papacy he did not renounce the Roman Catholic Church.[47] Ockham also held that councils of the Church were fallible, he held that any individual could err on matters of faith, and councils being composed of multiple fallible individuals could err.[48] He thus foreshadowed some elements of Luther's view of sola scriptura.[49][50][51]/nOckham taught the separation of church and state, believing that the pope and emperor should be separate.[52]/nOckham advocated for voluntary poverty.[53]/nOckham opposed Pope John XXII on the question of the Beatific Vision. John had proposed that the souls of Christians did not instantly get to enjoy the vision of God, rather such vision would be postponed until the last judgement.[54]/nWilliam of Ockham and his works have been discussed as a possible influence on several late medieval literary figures and works, especially Geoffrey Chaucer, but also Jean Molinet, the Gawain poet, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, John Skelton, Julian of Norwich, the York and Townely Plays, and Renaissance romances. Only in very few of these cases is it possible to demonstrate direct links to William of Ockham or his texts. Correspondences between Ockhamist and Nominalist philosophy/theology and literary texts from medieval to postmodern times have been discussed within the scholarly paradigm of literary nominalism.[55] Erasmus, in his Praise of Folly, criticized him together with Duns Scotus as fuelling unnecessary controversies inside the Church./nThe standard edition of the philosophical and theological works is: William of Ockham: Opera philosophica et theologica, Gedeon G\u00e1l, et al., eds. 17\u00a0vols.

He has been credited with establishing the discipline of mathematical statistics.[3][4] He founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London in 1911, and contributed significantly to the field of biometrics and meteorology. Pearson was also a proponent of Social Darwinism and eugenics, and his thought is an example of what is today described as scientific racism. Pearson was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and biographer of Sir Francis Galton.

His father was William Pearson QC of the Inner Temple, and his mother Fanny (n\u00e9e Smith), and he had two siblings, Arthur and Amy. Pearson attended University College School, followed by King's College, Cambridge, in 1876 to study mathematics,[5] graduating in 1879 as Third Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos. He then travelled to Germany to study physics at the University of Heidelberg under G. H. Quincke and metaphysics under Kuno Fischer. He next visited the University of Berlin, where he attended the lectures of the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond on Darwinism (Emil was a brother of Paul du Bois-Reymond, the mathematician). Pearson also studied Roman Law, taught by Bruns and Mommsen, medieval and 16th century German Literature, and Socialism. He became an accomplished historian and Germanist and spent much of the 1880s in Berlin, Heidelberg, Vienna[citation needed], Saig bei Lenzkirch, and Brixlegg. He wrote on Passion plays,[6] religion, Goethe, Werther, as well as sex-related themes,[7] and was a founder of the Men and Women's Club.[8]/nPearson was offered a Germanics post at King's College, Cambridge. Comparing Cambridge students to those he knew from Germany, Karl found German students inathletic and weak. He wrote his mother, \"I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, but now I think it cannot be too highly valued.\"[9]/nOn returning to England in 1880, Pearson first went to Cambridge:/nBack in Cambridge, I worked in the engineering shops, but drew up the schedule in Mittel- and Althochdeutsch for the Medieval Languages Tripos.[10]/nIn his first book, The New Werther, Pearson gives a clear indication of why he studied so many diverse subjects:/nI rush from science to philosophy, and from philosophy to our old friends the poets; and then, over-wearied by too much idealism, I fancy I become practical in returning to science. Have you ever attempted to conceive all there is in the world worth knowing\u2014that not one subject in the universe is unworthy of study? The giants of literature, the mysteries of many-dimensional space, the attempts of Boltzmann and Crookes to penetrate Nature's very laboratory, the Kantian theory of the universe, and the latest discoveries in embryology, with their wonderful tales of the development of life\u2014what an immensity beyond our grasp! [...] Mankind seems on the verge of a new and glorious discovery. What Newton did to simplify the planetary motions must now be done to unite in one whole the various isolated theories of mathematical physics.[11]/nPearson then returned to London to study law, emulating his father. Quoting Pearson's own account:/nComing to London, I read in chambers in Lincoln's Inn, drew up bills of sale, and was called to the Bar, but varied legal studies by lecturing on heat at Barnes, on Martin Luther at Hampstead, and on Lassalle and Marx on Sundays at revolutionary clubs around Soho.[10]/nHis next career move was to the Inner Temple, where he read law until 1881 (although he never practised). After this, he returned to mathematics, deputising for the mathematics professor at King's College, London in 1881 and for the professor at University College London in 1883. In 1884, he was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College London. Pearson became the editor of Common Sense of the Exact Sciences (1885) when William Kingdon Clifford died. 1891 saw him also appointed to the professorship of Geometry at Gresham College; here he met Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, a zoologist who had some interesting problems requiring quantitative solutions.[12] The collaboration, in biometry and evolutionary theory, was a fruitful one and lasted until Weldon died in 1906.[13] Weldon introduced Pearson to Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in aspects of evolution such as heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, at times to the verge of hero worship.[citation needed]/nAfter Galton's death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography\u2014a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs\u2014published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson's own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\", triumphed Galton's life, work and personal heredity. He predicted that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin./nWhen Galton died, he left the residue of his estate to the University of London for a chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair\u2014the Galton Chair of Eugenics, later the Galton Chair of Genetics[14]\u2014in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics (with financial support from the Drapers' Company), into which he incorporated the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He remained with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death./nIn 1890, Pearson married Maria Sharpe. The couple had three children: Sigrid Loetitia Pearson, Helga Sharpe Pearson, and Egon Pearson, who became a statistician himself and succeeded his father as head of the Applied Statistics Department at University College. Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory. He and his family lived at 7 Well Road in Hampstead, now marked with a blue plaque.[15][16] He died at Coldharbour, Surrey, on 27 April 1936./nWhen the 23-year-old Albert Einstein started the Olympia Academy study group in 1902, with his two younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading suggestion was Pearson's The Grammar of Science. This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists.[17] Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he argued, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time./nPearson's relativity was based on idealism, in the sense of ideas or pictures in a mind. \"There are many signs\", he wrote, \"that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.\" (Preface to second Ed., The Grammar of Science) Further, he stated, \"... science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind ... In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.\" (Ibid., Ch. II, \u00a7 6) \"Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man.\" (Ibid., Ch. III, \u00a7 4)[18]/nPearson was a \"zealous\" atheist and a freethinker.[19][20]\nPearson was known in his lifetime as a prominent \"freethinker\" and socialist. He gave lectures on such issues as \"the woman's question\" (this was the era of the suffragist movement in the UK)[21] and upon Karl Marx. His commitment to socialism and its ideals led him to refuse the offer of being created an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1920 and also to refuse a knighthood in 1935./nA eugenicist who applied social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against \"inferior races\" as a logical implication of the theory of evolution. \"My view \u2013 and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation\", he wrote, \"is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races.\"[22] He reasoned that, if August Weismann's theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock./nWeismann argued that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. Therefore, training benefits only the trained generation. Their children will not exhibit the learned improvements and, in turn, will need to be improved. \"No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers.\"[23]/nHistory shows me one way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the struggle of race with race, and the survival of the physically and mentally fitter race. If you want to know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended.[24]/nIn The Myth of the Jewish Race[25] Raphael and Jennifer Patai cite Karl Pearson's 1925 opposition (in the first issue of the journal Annals of Eugenics which he founded) to Jewish immigration into Britain. Pearson alleged that these immigrants \"will develop into a parasitic race. [...] Taken on the average, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population\".[26]/nPearson concluding remarks on stepping down as editor of the Annals of Eugenics, indicate a sense of failure of his aim to use the scientific study of eugenics as a guide for moral conduct and public policy.[27]/nMy  endeavour during the twenty-two years in which I have held the post of  Galton Professor has been to prove in the first place that Eugenics can be developed as an academic study, and in the second place to make the conclusions drawn from  that study a ground for social propagandism only when there are sound scientific reasons upon which to base our judgments and as a result  our opinions as to moral conduct.  Even  at the present  day there are far too many general impressions drawn from limited or too often wrongly interpreted experience, and far too many inadequately demonstrated and too lightly accepted theories for any nation to proceed hastily with unlimited Eugenic legislation. This statement, however, must never be taken as an excuse for indefinitely suspending all Eugenic teaching and every form of communal action in matters of sex./nIn June 2020 UCL announced that it was renaming two buildings which had been named after Pearson, because of his connection with eugenics.[28]/nKarl Pearson was important in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was one of several competing theories to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, \"Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution\" established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry.[29] These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits.[30] Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelians favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.[31]/nFor Pearson, the theory of evolution was not intended to identify a biological mechanism that explained patterns of inheritance, whereas Mendelian's theory postulated the gene as the mechanism for inheritance. Pearson criticized Bateson and other biologists for their failure to adopt biometrical techniques in their study of evolution.[32] Pearson criticized biologists who did not focus on the statistical validity of their theories, stating that \"before we can accept [any cause of a progressive change] as a factor we must have not only shown its plausibility but if possible have demonstrated its quantitative ability\"[33] Biologists had succumb to \"almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity,\" which had replaced the process of experimental data collection that actually might allow scientists to narrow down potential theories.[34]/nFor Pearson, laws of nature were useful for making accurate predictions and for concisely describing trends in observed data.[31] Causation was the experience \"that a certain sequence has occurred and recurred in the past\".[33] Thus, identifying a particular mechanism of genetics was not a worthy pursuit of biologists, who should instead focus on mathematical descriptions of empirical data. This, in part led to the fierce debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians, including Bateson. After Bateson rejected one of Pearson's manuscripts that described a new theory for the variability of an offspring, or homotyposis, Pearson and Weldon established Biometrika in 1902.[35] Although the biometric approach to inheritance eventually lost to the Mendelian approach, the techniques Pearson and the biometricians at the time developed are vital to studies of biology and evolution today./nPearson's work was all-embracing in the wide application and development of mathematical statistics, and encompassed the fields of biology, epidemiology, anthropometry, medicine, psychology and social history.[36] In 1901, with Weldon and Galton, he founded the journal Biometrika whose object was the development of statistical theory.[37] He edited this journal until his death. Among those who assisted Pearson in his research were a number of female mathematicians who included Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave, Frances Cave-Browne-Cave, and Alice Lee. He also founded the journal Annals of Eugenics (now Annals of Human Genetics) in 1925. He published the Drapers' Company Research Memoirs largely to provide a record of the output of the Department of Applied Statistics not published elsewhere./nPearson's thinking underpins many of the 'classical' statistical methods which are in common use today. Examples of his contributions are:/nPearson achieved widespread recognition across a range of disciplines and his membership of, and awards from, various professional bodies reflects this:/nHe was also elected an Honorary Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, University College London and the Royal Society of Medicine, and a Member of the Actuaries' Club.

He attended the St. Petersburg Grammar School, where some teachers saw him as a rebellious student. In his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics.  Later in life he attended Saint Petersburg Imperial University (now Saint Petersburg State University). Among his teachers were Yulian Sokhotski (differential calculus, higher algebra), Konstantin Posse (analytic geometry), Yegor Zolotarev (integral calculus), Pafnuty Chebyshev (number theory and probability theory), Aleksandr Korkin (ordinary and partial differential equations), Mikhail Okatov (mechanism theory), Osip Somov (mechanics), and Nikolai Budajev (descriptive and higher geometry).  He completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a Mathematician. He later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies. In this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills. He figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in Russian literature. He also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time.

Four years later in 1884, he defended his doctoral thesis titled \"On Certain Applications of the Algebraic Continuous Fractions\"./nHis pedagogical work began after the defense of his master's thesis in autumn 1880. As a privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus. Later he lectured alternately on \"introduction to analysis\", probability theory (succeeding Chebyshev, who had left the university in 1882) and the calculus of differences. From 1895 through 1905 he also lectured in differential calculus./nOne year after the defense of his doctoral thesis, Markov was appointed extraordinary professor (1886) and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the Academy of Sciences. In 1890, after the death of Viktor Bunyakovsky, Markov became an extraordinary member of the academy. His promotion to an ordinary professor of St. Petersburg University followed in the fall of 1894./nIn 1896, Markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of Chebyshev. In 1905, he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire, which he did immediately. Until 1910, however, he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences./nIn connection with student riots in 1908, professors and lecturers of St. Petersburg University were ordered to monitor their students. Markov refused to accept this decree, and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an \"agent of the governance\". Markov was removed from further teaching duties at St. Petersburg University, and hence he decided to retire from the university./nMarkov was an atheist. In 1912, he responded to Leo Tolstoy's excommunication from the Russian Orthodox Church by requesting his own excommunication. The Church complied with his request.[4][5]/nIn 1913, the council of St. Petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university. Markov was among them, but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education. The affirmation only occurred four years later, after the February Revolution in 1917.

After a brilliant academic record, he sailed to England in 1914 only a few months after Ramanujan.

He was also a physicist, general scholar, and publisher. His mathematical work was little noted until he was in his sixties. His work preceded and exceeded the concept which is now known as a vector space. He introduced the Grassmannian, the space which parameterizes all k-dimensional linear subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space V./nHermann Grassmann was the third of 12 children of Justus G\u00fcnter Grassmann, an ordained minister who taught mathematics and physics at the Stettin Gymnasium, where Hermann was educated./nGrassmann was an undistinguished student until he obtained a high mark on the examinations for admission to Prussian universities. Beginning in 1827, he studied theology at the University of Berlin, also taking classes in classical languages, philosophy, and literature. He does not appear to have taken courses in mathematics or physics./nAlthough lacking university training in mathematics, it was the field that most interested him when he returned to Stettin in 1830 after completing his studies in Berlin. After a year of preparation, he sat the examinations needed to teach mathematics in a gymnasium, but achieved a result good enough to allow him to teach only at the lower levels. Around this time, he made his first significant mathematical discoveries, ones that led him to the important ideas he set out in his 1844 paper Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik, here referred to as A1, later revised in 1862 as Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollst\u00e4ndig und in strenger Form bearbeitet, here referred to as A2./nIn 1834 Grassmann began teaching mathematics at the Gewerbeschule in Berlin. A year later, he returned to Stettin to teach mathematics, physics, German, Latin, and religious studies at a new school, the Otto Schule. Over the next four years, Grassmann passed examinations enabling him to teach mathematics, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy at all secondary school levels./nIn 1847, he was made an \"Oberlehrer\" or head teacher. In 1852, he was appointed to his late father's position at the Stettin Gymnasium, thereby acquiring the title of Professor. In 1847, he asked the Prussian Ministry of Education to be considered for a university position, whereupon that Ministry asked Ernst Kummer for his opinion of Grassmann. Kummer wrote back saying that Grassmann's 1846 prize essay (see below) contained \"commendably good material expressed in a deficient form.\" Kummer's report ended any chance that Grassmann might obtain a university post. This episode proved the norm; time and again, leading figures of Grassmann's day failed to recognize the value of his mathematics./nStarting during the political turmoil in Germany, 1848\u201349, Hermann and his brother Robert published a Stettin newspaper, Deutsche Wochenschrift f\u00fcr Staat, Kirche und Volksleben, calling for German unification under a constitutional monarchy. (This eventuated in 1871.) After writing a series of articles on constitutional law, Hermann parted company with the newspaper, finding himself increasingly at odds with its political direction./nGrassmann had eleven children, seven of whom reached adulthood. A son, Hermann Ernst Grassmann, became a professor of mathematics at the University of Giessen./nOne of the many examinations for which Grassmann sat required that he submit an essay on the theory of the tides. In 1840, he did so, taking the basic theory from Laplace's Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste and from Lagrange's M\u00e9canique analytique, but expositing this theory making use of the vector methods he had been mulling over since 1832. This essay, first published in the Collected Works of 1894\u20131911, contains the first known appearance of what is now called linear algebra and the notion of a vector space. He went on to develop those methods in his Die lineale Ausdehnungslehre, ein neuer Zweig der Mathematik (A1) and its later revision Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollst\u00e4ndig und in strenger Form bearbeitet (A2)./nIn 1844, Grassmann published his masterpiece (A1) commonly referred to as the Ausdehnungslehre, which translates as \"theory of extension\" or \"theory of extensive magnitudes\". Since A1 proposed a new foundation for all of mathematics, the work began with quite general definitions of a philosophical nature. Grassmann then showed that once geometry is put into the algebraic form he advocated, the number three has no privileged role as the number of spatial dimensions; the number of possible dimensions is in fact unbounded./nFearnley-Sander describes Grassmann's foundation of linear algebra  as follows:[1]/nThe definition of a linear space (vector space) [...] became widely known around 1920, when Hermann Weyl and others published formal definitions. In fact, such a definition had been given thirty years previously by Peano, who was thoroughly acquainted with Grassmann's mathematical work. Grassmann did not put down a formal definition \u2013 the language was not available \u2013 but there is no doubt that he had the concept./nBeginning with a collection of 'units' e1, e2, e3, ..., he effectively defines the free linear space that they generate; that is to say, he considers formal linear combinations a1e1 + a2e2 + a3e3 + ... where the aj are real numbers, defines addition and multiplication by real numbers [in what is now the usual way] and formally proves the linear space properties for these operations. ... He then develops the theory of linear independence in a way that is astonishingly similar to the presentation one finds in modern linear algebra texts. He defines the notions of subspace, linear independence, span, dimension, join and meet of subspaces, and projections of elements onto subspaces./n[...] few have come closer than Hermann Grassmann to creating, single-handedly, a new subject./nFollowing an idea of Grassmann's father, A1 also defined the exterior product, also called \"combinatorial product\" (in German: kombinatorisches Produkt or \u00e4u\u00dferes Produkt \u201couter product\u201d), the key operation of an algebra now called exterior algebra. (One should keep in mind that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra had yet to be defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule i2 = j2 = k2 = \u22121.) For more details, see Exterior algebra./nA1 was a revolutionary text, too far ahead of its time to be appreciated. When Grassmann submitted it to apply for a professorship in 1847, the ministry asked Ernst Kummer for a report. Kummer assured that there were good ideas in it, but found the exposition deficient and advised against giving Grassmann a university position. Over the next 10-odd years, Grassmann wrote a variety of work applying his theory of extension, including his 1845 Neue Theorie der Elektrodynamik and several papers on algebraic curves and surfaces, in the hope that these applications would lead others to take his theory seriously./nIn 1846, M\u00f6bius invited Grassmann to enter a competition to solve a problem first proposed by Leibniz: to devise a geometric calculus devoid of coordinates and metric properties (what Leibniz termed analysis situs). Grassmann's Geometrische Analyse gekn\u00fcpft an die von Leibniz erfundene geometrische Charakteristik, was the winning entry (also the only entry). M\u00f6bius, as one of the judges, criticized the way Grassmann introduced abstract notions without giving the reader any intuition as to why those notions were of value./nIn 1853, Grassmann published a theory of how colors mix; his theory's four color laws are still taught, as Grassmann's laws. Grassmann's work on this subject was inconsistent with that of Helmholtz.[citation needed] Grassmann also wrote on crystallography, electromagnetism, and mechanics./nIn 1861, Grassmann laid the groundwork for Peano's axiomatization of arithmetic in his Lehrbuch der Arithmetik.[2] In 1862, Grassmann published a thoroughly rewritten second edition of A1, hoping to earn belated recognition for his theory of extension, and containing the definitive exposition of his linear algebra. The result, Die Ausdehnungslehre: Vollst\u00e4ndig und in strenger Form bearbeitet (A2), fared no better than A1, even though A2's manner of exposition anticipates the textbooks of the 20th century./nIn the 1840s, mathematicians were generally unprepared to understand Grassmann's ideas.[3] In the 1860s and 1870s various mathematicians came to ideas similar to that of Grassmann's, but Grassmann himself was not interested in mathematics anymore.[3]:\u200a46/nAdh\u00e9mar Jean Claude Barr\u00e9 de Saint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of Grassmann, which he published in 1845. He then entered into a dispute with Grassmann about which of the two had thought of the ideas first. Grassmann had published his results in 1844, but Saint-Venant claimed that he had first developed these ideas in 1832./nOne of the first mathematicians to appreciate Grassmann's ideas during his lifetime was Hermann Hankel, whose 1867 Theorie der complexen Zahlensysteme.[4]/n[\u2026], he developed [\u2026] some of Hermann Grassmann's algebras and W.R. Hamilton's quaternions. Hankel was the first to recognise the significance of Grassmann's long-neglected writings and was strongly influenced by them./nIn 1872 Victor Schlegel published the first part of his System der Raumlehre, which used Grassmann's approach to derive ancient and modern results in plane geometry. Felix Klein wrote a negative review of Schlegel's book citing its incompleteness and lack of perspective on Grassmann. Schlegel followed in 1875 with a second part of his System according to Grassmann, this time developing higher-dimensional geometry. Meanwhile, Klein was advancing his Erlangen program, which also expanded the scope of geometry.[5]/nComprehension of Grassmann awaited the concept of vector spaces, which then could express the multilinear algebra of his extension theory.  To establish the priority of Grassmann over Hamilton, Josiah Willard Gibbs urged Grassmann's heirs to have the 1840 essay on tides published.[6] A. N. Whitehead's first monograph, the Universal Algebra (1898), included the first systematic exposition in English of the theory of extension and the exterior algebra. With the rise of differential geometry the exterior algebra was applied to differential forms./nIn 1995 Lloyd C. Kannenberg published an English translation of The Ausdehnungslehre and Other works. For an introduction to the role of Grassmann's work in contemporary mathematical physics see The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose.[7]/nGrassmann's mathematical ideas began to spread only towards the end of his life. Thirty years after the publication of A1 the publisher wrote to Grassmann: \u201cYour book Die Ausdehnungslehre has been out of print for some time. Since your work hardly sold at all, roughly 600 copies were used in 1864 as waste paper and the remaining few odd copies have now been sold out, with the exception of the one copy in our library.\u201d[3]:\u200a45\u200a Disappointed by the reception of his work in mathematical circles, Grassmann lost his contacts with mathematicians as well as his interest in geometry. The last years of his life he turned to historical linguistics and the study of Sanskrit. He wrote books on German grammar, collected folk songs, and learned Sanskrit. He wrote a 2,000-page dictionary and a translation of the Rigveda (more than 1,000 pages). In modern studies of the Rigveda, Grassmann's work is often cited. In 1955 a third edition of his dictionary was issued.[3]:\u200a46/nGrassmann also noticed and presented a phonological rule that exists in both Sanskrit and Greek. In his honor, this phonological rule is known as Grassmann's law. His discovery was revolutionary for historical linguistics at the time, as it challenged the widespread notion of Sanskrit as an older predecessor to other Indo-European languages.[8] This was a widespread assumption due to Sanskrit's more agglutinative structure, which languages like Latin and Greek were thought to have passed through to reach their more \"modern\" synthetic structure. However, Grassman's work proved that, in at least one phonological pattern, German was indeed \"older\" (i.e., less synthetic) than Sanskrit. This meant that genealogical and typological classifications of languages were at last correctly separated in linguistics, allowing significant progress for later linguists.[9]/nThese philological accomplishments were honored during his lifetime. He was elected to the American Oriental Society and in 1876 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of T\u00fcbingen./nNote: Extensive online bibliography, revealing substantial contemporary interest in Grassmann's life and work.

His father was a mechanically talented officer in the Dutch Navy.  After the family (less the father) relocated to Ireland in the late 1920s, Willem studied mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin, where he earned a gold medal.  He went on to earn an M.A. from the University of Toronto and his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh./nIn the mid-1930s, van Stockum became an early enthusiast of the then new theory of gravitation, general relativity.  In 1937, he published a paper which contains one of the first exact solutions in general relativity which modeled the gravitational field produced by a configuration of rotating matter, the van Stockum dust, which remains an important example noted for its unusual simplicity.  In this paper, van Stockum was apparently the first to notice the possibility of closed timelike curves, one of the strangest and most disconcerting phenomena in general relativity./nVan Stockum left for the United States in hope of studying under Albert Einstein, eventually in the spring of 1939 gaining a temporary position under Professor Oswald Veblen at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  The outbreak of the Second World War occurred while he was teaching at the University of Maryland. Anxious to join the fight against Hitler, he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force, eventually earning his pilots wings in July 1942.  Because of his advanced knowledge of physics, he spent much of the next year as a test pilot in Canada. After the Netherlands was invaded by Hitler, van Stockum sought to join the war as a pilot. Finally, he was able to transfer to the Dutch Air Force (in exile), and in 1944 became the only Dutch officer posted to No. 10 Sq\u00adron of the RAF Bomber Command, which was stationed in Yorkshire and flew combat missions in the Halifax heavy bomber over Europe before and after the Normandy invasion.

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation./nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Lady Byron.[2] All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women.[3] Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever.  He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace./nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\"[4] and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".[5]/nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville./nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called \"Notes\"./nLovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program\u2014that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[6][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[7] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[3]/nLord Byron expected his child to be a \"glorious boy\" and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl.[8] The child was named after Byron's half-sister, Augusta Leigh, and was called \"Ada\" by Byron himself.[9] On 16 January 1816, at Lord Byron's command, Lady Byron left for her parents' home at Kirkby Mallory, taking their five-week-old daughter with her.[8] Although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation, Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights,[10] but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ada's welfare.[11]/nOn 21 April, Lord Byron signed the deed of separation, although very reluctantly, and left England for good a few days later.[12] Aside from an acrimonious separation, Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband's immoral behaviour.[13] This set of events made Lovelace infamous in Victorian society. Ada did not have a relationship with her father. He died in 1824 when she was eight years old. Her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life.[14] Lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday.[15]/nLovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother. She was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke, who doted on her. However, because of societal attitudes of the time\u2014which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation\u2014Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern.[16] In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as \"it\": \"I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own.\"[17] Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation. Lovelace dubbed these observers the \"Furies\" and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.[18]/nLovelace was often ill, beginning in early childhood. At the age of eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.[9] In June 1829, she was paralyzed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, something which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, she was able to walk with crutches. Despite the illnesses, she developed her mathematical and technological skills./nWhen Ada was twelve years old, this future \"Lady Fairy\", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada Byron went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to \"cut across the country by the most direct road\", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the \"art of flying\".[3]/nAda Byron had an affair with a tutor in early 1833. She tried to elope with him after she was caught, but the tutor's relatives recognised her and contacted her mother. Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal.[19] Lovelace never met her younger half-sister, Allegra, the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Clairmont. Allegra died in 1822 at the age of five. Lovelace did have some contact with Elizabeth Medora Leigh, the daughter of Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh, who purposely avoided Lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court.[20]/nLovelace became close friends with her tutor Mary Somerville, who introduced her to Charles Babbage in 1833. She had a strong respect and affection for Somerville,[21] and they corresponded for many years. Other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. She was presented at Court at the age of seventeen \"and became a popular belle of the season\" in part because of her \"brilliant mind\".[22] By 1834 Ada was a regular at Court and started attending various events. She danced often and was able to charm many people, and was described by most people as being dainty, although John Hobhouse, Byron's friend, described her as \"a large, coarse-skinned young woman but with something of my friend's features, particularly the mouth\".[23] This description followed their meeting on 24 February 1834 in which Ada made it clear to Hobhouse that she did not like him, probably due to her mother's influence, which led her to dislike all of her father's friends. This first impression was not to last, and they later became friends.[24]/nOn 8 July 1835, she married William, 8th Baron King, becoming Lady King. They had three homes: Ockham Park, Surrey; a Scottish estate on Loch Torridon in Ross-shire; and a house in London. They spent their honeymoon at Worthy Manor in Ashley Combe near Porlock Weir, Somerset. The Manor had been built as a hunting lodge in 1799 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon. It later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time. From 1845, the family's main house was Horsley Towers, built in the Tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament, Charles Barry,[25][26] and later greatly enlarged to Lovelace's own designs./nThey had three children: Byron (born 1836); Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born 1837); and Ralph Gordon (born 1839). Immediately after the birth of Annabella, Lady King experienced \"a tedious and suffering illness, which took months to cure\".[24] Ada was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace and in 1838, her husband was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning Ada became the Countess of Lovelace.[27] In 1843\u201344, Ada's mother assigned William Benjamin Carpenter to teach Ada's children and to act as a \"moral\" instructor for Ada.[28] He quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections, claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an \"unbecoming\" manner. When it became clear that Carpenter was trying to start an affair, Ada cut it off.[29]/nIn 1841, Lovelace and Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) were told by Ada's mother that Ada's father was also Medora's father.[30] On 27 February 1841, Ada wrote to her mother: \"I am not in the least astonished. In fact, you merely confirm what I have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about, but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected.\"[31] She did not blame the incestuous relationship on Byron, but instead blamed Augusta Leigh: \"I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was.\"[32] In the 1840s, Ada flirted with scandals: firstly, from a relaxed approach to extra-marital relationships with men, leading to rumours of affairs;[33] and secondly, from her love of gambling. She apparently lost more than \u00a33,000 on the horses during the later 1840s.[34] The gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends, and an ambitious attempt in 1851 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This went disastrously wrong, leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate, forcing her to admit it all to her husband.[35] She had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John from 1844 onwards. John Crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement. She bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her.[36] During her final illness, she would panic at the idea of the younger Crosse being kept from visiting her.[37]/nFrom 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to emerge,[22] and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life.[38] Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her \"much help in her mathematical studies\" including study of advanced calculus topics including the \"numbers of Bernoulli\" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[39] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to become \"an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence\".[40]/nLovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science. Whilst studying differential calculus, she wrote to De Morgan:/nI may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies. I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar.[41]/nLovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued metaphysics as much as mathematics, viewing both as tools for exploring \"the unseen worlds around us\".[42]/nLovelace died at the age of 36 on 27 November 1852,[43] from uterine cancer.[44] The illness lasted several months, in which time Annabella took command over whom Ada saw, and excluded all of her friends and confidants. Under her mother's influence, Ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making Annabella her executor.[45] She lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside. It is not known what she told him.[46] She was buried, at her request, next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque, written in Latin, to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.[citation needed]/nThroughout her life, Lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day, including phrenology[47] and mesmerism.[48] After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings (\"a calculus of the nervous system\").[49] She never achieved this, however. In part, her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her \"potential\" madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments.[50] In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.[51] In 1851, the year before her cancer struck, she wrote to her mother mentioning \"certain productions\" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.[52]/nLovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine.[53] She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her \"The Enchantress of Number\".[54][b] In 1843, he wrote to her:/nForget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multitudinous Charlatans\u2014every thing in short but the Enchantress of Number.[54]/nDuring a nine-month period in 1842\u201343, Lovelace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.[55] With the article, she appended a set of notes.[56] Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task; many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it.[57] Lovelace's notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine.[58] Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.[59]/nThe notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include (in Note G),[60] in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine, which might have run correctly had it ever been built[61] (only Babbage's Difference Engine has been built, completed in London in 2002).[62] Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer[63][failed verification] and her method has been called the world's first computer program.[64] Others dispute this because some of Charles Babbage's earlier writings could be considered computer programs./nNote G also contains Lovelace's dismissal of artificial intelligence. She wrote that \"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\" This objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal, for example by Alan Turing in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".[65] Most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers.[66]/nLovelace and Babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published, when he tried to leave his own statement (criticising the government's treatment of his Engine) as an unsigned preface, which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration. When Taylor's Scientific Memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed, Babbage wrote to Lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper. This was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned, and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper. The historian Benjamin Woolley theorised that \"His actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ada's involvement, and so happily indulged her\u00a0... because of her 'celebrated name'.\"[67] Their friendship recovered, and they continued to correspond. On 12 August 1851, when she was dying of cancer, Lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor, though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority. Part of the terrace at Worthy Manor was known as Philosopher's Walk; it was there that Lovelace and Babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles.[59]/nIn 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine. Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's lecture into French, and this transcript was subsequently published in the Biblioth\u00e8que universelle de Gen\u00e8ve in October 1842.\nBabbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English. She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper, were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.[68]/nAda Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In Note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.[69][70] The engine was never completed and so her program was never tested.[71]/nIn 1953, more than a century after her death, Ada Lovelace's notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine were republished as an appendix to B. V. Bowden's Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines.[72] The engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software.[61]/nIn her notes, Ada Lovelace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[73] She realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. In her notes, she wrote:/n[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.[74][75]/nThis analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised. Walter Isaacson ascribes Ada's insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles: \"When she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns, it reminded her of how Babbage's engine used punched cards to make calculations.\"[76] This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as the programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.[77][78][79]/nAccording to the historian of computing and Babbage specialist Doron Swade:/nAda saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were bound by number...What Lovelace saw...was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation\u2014to general-purpose computation\u2014and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.[63]/nLovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism, as covered in an 1834 article on the Difference Engine,[80] \nand the logical structure of the Analytical Engine, on which the article she was reviewing dwelt. She noted that different specialists might be required in each area./nThe [1834 article] chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect, entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative, but giving, in considerable length, many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences. M. Menabrea, on the contrary, exclusively developes the analytical view; taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes, but without attempting to explain how; and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism. It is obvious that, in the invention of a calculating engine, these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation... They are indissolubly connected, though so different in their intrinsic nature, that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both.[60]:\u200aNote A/nThough Lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing suggest otherwise./nAllan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:/nAll but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a \"bug\" in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.[81]/nBruce Collier wrote that Lovelace \"made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way\".[82]/nEugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it \"incorrect\" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never published.[71] Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace's notes.[83] Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace's notes as \"more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development\".[84]/nDoron Swade has said that Ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it, but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities.[85]/nIn his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace's contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that \"there's nothing as sophisticated\u2014or as clean\u2014as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it.\" Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence \"a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine\u2014something which Babbage never did\".[86]/nThe computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.[87] The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth./nIn 1981, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award.[88][89] As of 1998[update], the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal,[90] and in 2008 initiated an annual competition for women students.[91] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women undergraduates.[91] Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.[92]/nAda Lovelace Day is an annual event celebrated on the second Tuesday of October,[93] which began in 2009.[94] Its goal is to \"...\u00a0raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering, and maths,\" and to \"create new role models for girls and women\" in these fields.

After attending the Hamilton Academy and Paisley Grammar school he entered the University of Glasgow, graduating BSc (1879) and MA (1881) gaining highest honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and the Ferguson Scholarship. Winning the four year George A. Clark Scholarship from Glasgow, Muirhead then continued his studies at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where in 1886 he won the Smith\u2019s Prize for his essay on Newton's laws of motion, following a year at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[1][2]/nAlso during his tenureship of the George A. Clark Scholarship, Muirhead conducted classes at the University of Glasgow for pass and honours men thereafter holding teaching posts including as lecturer on Mathematics at Mason Science College (which later became Birmingham University), from 1891 to 1893, in which latter year he married and settled in Glasgow, coaching in mathematics, physics and engineering, and founding the Glasgow Tutorial College./nMuirhead was to publish many Papers on mathematics in the Proceedings and Mathematical Notes of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society and in the Mathematical Gazette, but is principally known for his Papers on Inequalities and as the author of Muirhead's inequality theory.[3]/nMuirhead was elected a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in February 1884, and twice elected its president (in 1899 and 1909.)

It was written and translated by Antonella Cupillari, with a foreword by Patricia R. Allaire, and published in 2008 by the Edwin Mellen Press./nThe main part of the book, over 100 pages, is a translation into English of an Italian-language biography of Agnesi, Elogio storico di Donna Maria Gaetana Agnesi, which was written in the year of her death by historian Antonio Francesco Frisi and republished in 1965.[1] It covers the cultural background that allowed her to become a mathematician, and her brief mathematical career from her teens to her thirties, as well as her work caring for the needy in the remaining fifty years of her life.[2]/nFrisi was a family friend of Agnesi. He was the first to write a biography about her. To balance this material with a more objective view of Agnesi,[2] Cupillari has added over 50 pages of notes,[1] derived from two more Italian-language biographies of Agnesi, Maria Gaetana \u00c0gnesi (Luisa Anzoletti, 1900) and Maria Gaetana Agnesi (Giovanna Tilche, 1984).[3] Another large section includes  translations and explanations of excerpts from Agnesi's mathematical textbook, Institutioni Analitiche (1748),[1][3] which was \"the first textbook to provide a unified treatment of algebra, Cartesian geometry and calculus\", and by being written in vernacular Italian rather than Latin was aimed at a wider audience than the educated scholars of her day.[2] Cupillari concludes her biography with a bibliography of material about Agnesi.[1]/nReviewers Luigi Pepe and Franka Bruckler recommend the book as a \"useful introduction\" and \"unique, comprehensive source\" on Agnesi and her work, particularly for people who read English but not Italian.[1][3] Bruckler includes among its potential readers historians of mathematics, mathematics educators, and members of the public.[3] Reviewer Edith Mendez describes the book as \"an easy read\", and its mathematics as accessible to undergraduate mathematics students,[4] but this is contradicted by Peter Ruane, who found the \"fragmented\" and \"eulogistic\" first part difficult to follow and to stomach.[2] Mendez also criticizes the book for being inadequately copyedited,[4] and Ruane suggests that the book would have been improved by more context of what was happening in mathematics in Europe at the time.[2]", "58885111": "Onorato Candiota (... \u2013 after 1808) was an Italian professor of philosophy and math at the Real Convitto di Bari, in Bari, Italy.[1] He lived between the 18th and 19th centuries.

His contributions include the Hamming code (which makes use of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), Hamming graph concepts, and the Hamming distance./nBorn in Chicago, Hamming attended University of Chicago, University of Nebraska and the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky (1901\u20131973). In April 1945, he joined the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, where he programmed the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. He left to join the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1946. Over the next fifteen years, he was involved in nearly all of the laboratories' most prominent achievements. For his work, he received the Turing Award in 1968, being its third recipient.[1]/nAfter retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976, Hamming took a position at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science, and devoted himself to teaching and writing books. He delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before he died from a heart attack on January 7, 1998./nHamming was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915,[2] the son of Richard J. Hamming, a credit manager, and Mabel G. Redfield.[3] He grew up in Chicago, where he attended Crane Technical High School and Crane Junior College.[3]/nHamming initially wanted to study engineering, but money was scarce during the Great Depression, and the only scholarship offer he received came from the University of Chicago, which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics,[4] and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1937.[2] He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. \"As an engineer,\" he said, \"I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work.\"[2]/nHe went on to earn a Master of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1939, and then entered the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, where he wrote his doctoral thesis on Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations under the supervision of Waldemar Trjitzinsky.[4] His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinsky's work in that area. He looked at Green's function and further developed Jacob Tamarkin's methods for obtaining characteristic solutions.[5] While he was a graduate student, he discovered and read George Boole's  The Laws of Thought.[6]/nThe University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign awarded Hamming his Doctor of Philosophy in 1942, and he became an instructor in mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942,[4] immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, and had no children.[3] In 1944, he became an assistant professor at the J.B. Speed Scientific School at the University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.[4]/nWith World War II still ongoing, Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory, in Hans Bethe's division, programming the IBM calculating machines that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a human computer, working for Bethe and Edward Teller.[4] Hamming later recalled that:/nShortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done\u2014either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, \"It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere.\" I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, \"The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen\u2014after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels.\" He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, \"What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?\" I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me. I told him. His reply was, \"Never mind, Hamming, no one will ever blame you.\"[6]/nHamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a post at the  Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming.[3] Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a \"computer janitor\",[7] he saw computer simulations of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory. \"And when I had time to think about it,\" he later recalled, \"I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed\".[2]/nAt the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with Claude Shannon. The Mathematical Research Department also included John Tukey and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and Brockway McMillan. Shannon, Ling, McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the Young Turks.[4] \"We were first-class troublemakers,\" Hamming later recalled. \"We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results. Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time.\"[2]/nAlthough Hamming had been hired to work on elasticity theory, he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines.[7] Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off.[8] Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen \"bits\".[9] If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. \"If the computer can tell when an error has occurred,\" Hamming reasoned, \"surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself.\"[8]/nHamming set himself the task of solving this problem,[3] which he realised would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance.[10] Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting codes, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.[10][11]/nThe Hamming bound, also known as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary block code. It is from an interpretation in terms of sphere packing in the Hamming distance into the space of all possible words.  It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded.  A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.[12][13]/nReturning to differential equations, Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them. A popular approach at the time was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne.[14] This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method.[15] He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).[16]/nDuring the 1950s, he programmed one of the earliest computers, the IBM 650, and with Ruth A. Weiss developed the L2 programming language, one of the earliest computer languages, in 1956. It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who knew it as Bell 2. It was superseded by Fortran when the Bell Labs' IBM 650 were replaced by the IBM 704 in 1957.[17]/nIn A Discipline of Programming (1976), Edsger Dijkstra attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding regular numbers.[18] The problem became known as \"Hamming's problem\", and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science, although he did not discover them.[19]/nThroughout his time at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided management responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. \"I knew in a sense that by avoiding management,\" he later recalled, \"I was not doing my duty by the organization. That is one of my biggest failures.\"[2]/nHamming served as president of the Association for Computing Machinery from 1958 to 1960.[7] In 1960, he predicted that one day half of the Bell Labs budget would be spent on computing. None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high, but his forecast  actually proved to be too low.[20] His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers (1962):/nThe purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.[21]/nIn later life, Hamming became interested in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, when he left Bell Labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, Stevens Institute of Technology, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University.[22] As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.[2]/nIn 1976 he moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he worked as an adjunct professor and senior lecturer in computer science.[3] He gave up research, and concentrated on teaching and writing books.[4] He noted that:/nThe way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull. In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus, I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about! The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle \u2013 hard to be sure, but the result is of no significance in life.[4]/nHamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text, Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics (1985).[4] In 1993, he remarked that \"when I left BTL, I knew that that was the end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end.\"[2] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997,[23] and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.[7] He was survived by his wife Wanda.[23]/nHamming's final recorded lecture series[24] is maintained by Naval Postgraduate School along with ongoing work[25] that preserves his insights and extends his legacy./nThe IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal, named after him, is an award given annually by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), for \"exceptional contributions to information sciences, systems and technology\", and he was the first recipient of this medal.[34] The reverse side of the medal depicts a Hamming parity check matrix for a Hamming error-correcting code.[7]", "3572736": "Gerald James Whitrow (9 June 1912 \u2013 2 June 2000) was a British mathematician, cosmologist and science historian./nWhitrow was born on 9 June 1912 at Kimmeridge in Dorset, the elder son of William and Emily (n\u00e9e Watkins) Whitrow./nAfter completing school at Christ's Hospital, he obtained a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford in 1930, earning his first degree in 1933; he was a Harmsworth Senior Scholar at Merton College, Oxford, from 1935 to 1937, taking his MA in 1937,[1] and was awarded his PhD in 1939.[2] At Oxford he worked on an alternative theory of relativity with Professor Edward Arthur Milne. During World War II, he worked as a scientific officer for the Ministry of Supply. His work was on defence research, including ballistics, and he worked at Fort Halstead (near Sevenoaks) and Cambridge.[2] After the war, he taught at the Imperial College, London, first as a lecturer, then as reader of applied mathematics (1951), and as professor of the history of mathematics in 1972./nIn 1955 Whitrow investigated the possibility of extradimensional space in \"Why Physical Space Has Three Dimensions.\"[3]  He argued that if space has four dimensions and the laws of gravitation and electromagnetism remain unchanged, the inverse square law would be transformed into an inverse cube law, leading to unstable planetary orbits and atomic structures. These instabilities would worsen for dimensions larger than four. If spatial dimensions were reduced to two, the propagation and reflection of waves would be more difficult, which would reduce coherent behavior of complex systems. He concluded that life would not be possible in other than three space dimensions.[4]/nFollowing his 1979 retirement, he was emeritus professor and senior research fellow of the Imperial College. For much of his life he was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, to which he made an extraordinary contribution by reorganizing its important library and archives when he became chairman of the library committee in the early 1960s, a position he held until 1975.[2] In 1971 he was among the founders of the British Society for the History of Science. Whitrow's interest in libraries and archives extended to the Athenaeum Club, of which he was elected a member in 1957. He served two terms on the club's library committee and was its chairman between 1979 and 1981. He was responsible for founding some of the various discussion groups that exist in the club, and in the early 1990s he served on its executive committee.[2]/nHis main contributions were in the fields of cosmology and astrophysics, but his interests included the history and philosophy of science, with a particular focus on the concept of time.

In the 1970s, Dennis Sullivan developed the notion of a minimal model of a differential graded algebra.[6] One of the simplest examples of a differential graded algebra is the space of smooth differential forms on a smooth manifold, so that Sullivan was able to apply his theory to understand the topology of smooth manifolds. In the setting of K\u00e4hler geometry, due to the corresponding version of the Poincar\u00e9 lemma, this differential graded algebra has a decomposition into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts. In collaboration with Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and Sullivan, Morgan used this decomposition to apply Sullivan's theory to study the topology of compact K\u00e4hler manifolds. Their primary result is that the real homotopy type of such a space is determined by its cohomology ring. Morgan later extended this analysis to the setting of smooth complex algebraic varieties, using Deligne's formulation of mixed Hodge structures to extend the K\u00e4hler decomposition of smooth differential forms and of the exterior derivative.[7]/nIn 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman posted three papers to the arXiv which purported to use Richard Hamilton's theory of Ricci flow solve the geometrization conjecture in three-dimensional topology, of which the renowned Poincar\u00e9 conjecture is a special case.[8] Perelman's first two papers claimed to prove the geometrization conjecture; the third paper gives an argument which would obviate the technical work in the second half of the second paper in order to give a shortcut to prove the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Many mathematicians found Perelman's work to be hard to follow due to a lack of detail on a number of technical points.[citation needed]/nStarting in 2003, and culminating in a 2008 publication, Bruce Kleiner and John Lott posted detailed annotations of Perelman's first two papers to their websites, covering his work on the proof of the geometrization conjecture.[9] In 2006, Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu published an exposition of Hamilton and Perelman's works, also covering Perelman's first two articles.[10] In 2007, Morgan and Gang Tian published a book on Perelman's first paper, the first half of his second paper, and his third paper. As such, they covered the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. In 2014, they published a book covering the remaining details for the geometrization conjecture. In 2006, Morgan gave a plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, saying that Perelman's work had \"now been thoroughly checked. He has proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.\"[11] The level of detail in Morgan and Tian's work was criticized in 2015 by mathematician Abbas Bahri, who found a counterexample to one of their claims corresponding to Perelman's third paper.[12][13] The error, originating in the incorrect calculation of a geometric evolution equation, was thereafter fixed by Morgan and Tian.[citation needed]/nArticles./nSurvey articles./nBooks.", "58295334": "Moses ben Samuel Zuriel (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b9\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d4 \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05e6\u05d5\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, Moshe ben Shmu\u2019el Tzuri\u2019el)  was a seventeenth-century Jewish mathematician.

At the start of the 19th century, Adrien-Marie Legendre and Carl Friedrich Gauss suggested that as \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n goes very large, the number of primes up to \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n is asymptotic to \n\n\n\nx\n\n/\n\nlog\n\u2061\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x/\\log x}\n\n, where \n\n\n\nlog\n\u2061\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log x}\n\n is the natural logarithm of \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n./nwhere the integral is evaluated at \n\n\n\nt\n=\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle t=n}\n\n, also fits the distribution./nThe prime-counting function \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi (n)}\n\n is defined as the number of primes not greater than \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n.[5]/nAnd \n\n\n\n\u0394\n(\nn\n)\n=\n\u03c0\n(\nn\n)\n\u2212\nli\n\u2061\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta (n)=\\pi (n)-\\operatorname {li} (n)}/nBernhard Riemann stated that  \n\n\n\n\u0394\n(\nn\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\Delta (n)}\n\n was always negative but J.E. Littlewood later disproved this.\nIn 1914 J.E.

One area was on the distribution of prime numbers in different residue classes modulo \n\n\n\nk\n\n\n{\\displaystyle k}\n\n./nModular arithmetic modifies usual arithmetic by only using the numbers \n\n\n\n{\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n\u2026\n,\nn\n\u2212\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{0,1,2,\\dots ,n-1\\}}\n\n, for a natural number \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n called the modulus.  Any other natural number can be mapped into this system by replacing it by its remainder after division by \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n.[7]/nThe distribution of the primes looks random, without a pattern. Take a list of consecutive prime numbers and divide them by another prime (like 7) and keep only the remainder (this is called reducing them modulo 7). The result is a sequence of integers from 1 to 6. Knapowski worked to determine the parameters of this modular distribution[8]", "885810": "Johannes St\u00f6ffler (also St\u00f6fler, Stoffler, Stoeffler; 10 December 1452 \u2013 16 February 1531) was a German mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, priest, maker of astronomical instruments and professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen./nJohannes St\u00f6ffler was born on 10 December 1452, in Justingen (now part of Schelklingen) on the Swabian Alb.

Because of this, however, he began to gain notoriety as a dissident of the Salazar regime, which condemned independent thinking. Eventually, he left Portugal for South America to escape further persecution for his involvement with the Portuguese Communist party. Following his exile, which lasted nearly two decades, Gomes returned to Portugal for the last ten years of his life before he died of a heart attack in 1984.[1][2]/nRuy Lu\u00eds Gomes was born on 5 December 1905 in Porto, Portugal to Maria Jos\u00e9 de Medeiros Alves Gomes and Ant\u00f3nio Luiz Gomes, who was a government official during the Portuguese First Republic.

In 1922, he completed his secondary education at Jos\u00e9 Falc\u00e3o High School before continuing on to study mathematics at the University of Coimbra. In 1928, he received his doctorate from the University of Coimbra at the age of 23. In his dissertation, he analyzed problems in mechanics regarding deviation from holonomic constraints.[1]/nIn May 1929, shortly after receiving his doctorate, Ruy Lu\u00eds Gomes applied for a professorship in the mathematical sciences, mechanics, and astronomy group at the University of Coimbra. However, when another candidate for the position was removed from consideration, he objected to the decision and pressured university officials to give him the position. When Gomes' competitor was given the professorship, Gomes returned to Porto and began to teach higher algebra and projective geometry at the University of Porto. In 1933, at the age of 28, he became a Full Professor of mathematics and physics at the same institution.[3] Here, he began a relationship with Professor Abel Salazar, who taught Gomes about neopositivism and inspired his research on the Theory of Relativity.[1]/nGomes was dedicated to the dissemination of research in the mathematical sciences. He founded the Portugaliae Mathematica journal in 1937 with the help of his colleagues and published his research in numerous journals in Portugal and throughout Europe. In 1942, he founded the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Porto, where he trained aspiring mathematicians and organized research seminars.[2] Gomes taught courses in the Theory of Relativity, Theory of Potential, Theory of Measure and Integration, Hilbert Spaces, and Quantum Mechanics over the course of his career.[1] As an instructor, he utilized discussion-based classes in an attempt to involve his students in his research.[2]/nThroughout the 1930s and 1940s, Ruy Lu\u00eds Gomes earned recognition from academics throughout Europe, including Tullio Levi-Civita, John von Neumann, and Nobel Prize winner Louis de Broglie, for his research in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. However, in 1947, the Salazar regime banished Gomes and many other researchers from the university.[2] After a decade of political persecution and involvement with the Portuguese Communist party, he fled to Argentina in order to continue his academic pursuits at the Universidad Nacional del Sur in Bahia Blanca. In 1962, he relocated to the University of Pernambuco in Recife, Brazil, where he would eventually gain the title of Professor Emeritus.[1]/nRuy Lu\u00eds Gomes returned to his hometown in 1974 and accepted the position of Rector of the University of Porto.

In 1951, he was chosen to be the presidential candidate of the communist party, against the candidate of the regime, General Francisco Craveiro Lopes, and the moderate opposition candidate, Admiral Manuel Quint\u00e3o Meireles. However, before the election, the Salazar regime enacted measures through the Supreme Court of Justice which disallowed his candidature due to his communist leanings. In the years between his founding of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in 1942 and his departure for Argentina in 1958, Gomes was imprisoned on numerous occasions for his political affiliations. Thus, he sought refuge in Argentina in order to escape the political persecution that made his scientific research impossible.

In the former, Friesenhausen writes in support of the Copernican heliocentrism, one of the first Jews to do so.[4]/nIn 1756, David Friesenhausen was born in Friesenhausen, a small community in southern Germany, 100 kilometres (60\u00a0mi) northeast of Frankfurt.[3]  In 1783, Friesenhausen married, but was divorced four years later.[3] For the first 30 years of his life, Friesenhausen dedicated himself exclusively Torah study.[1] His teachers included Joseph Steinhardt at F\u00fcrth and Moses Sofer of Pressburg.[1] The latter attested that Friesenhausen was one of the outstanding students in his yeshiva.[1]  In 1786, Friesenhausen began immersing himself in various secular subjects, including math, astronomy, and philosophy.[1][4]/nIn 1788, Friesenhausen moved to Berlin where he lived for the next eight years and was supported by Benjamin Halberstat.[3] Berlin at that time was the center of the haskala movement (Jewish Enlightenment).[4] Despite his involvement in secular subjects, Friesenhausen continued to study Torah intensively.[4]  In 1796, Friesenhausen published his first book, Kelil Heshbon a Hebrew language manual on algebra and trigonometry.[2][3][6] Thereafter, Friesenhausen left Berlin to travel throughout Europe for the dual purpose of selling  his newly published book and to attain advance subscriptions for planned book, Mosodot Tevel.[6]/nAround 1800, Friesenhausen moved to Huncovce (then Hungary, now Slovakia) in the Carpathian Mountains.[3][4] He was appointed dayyan (judge) and also worked as a merchant.[6] According to Meir Gilon in R.

According to Falk's reasoning, Panini must have lived during the decennia following 350 BCE, that is, just before (or contemporaneously with?) the invasion of Alexander of Macedonia[2]/nCardona mentions two major pieces of internal evidence for the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[32] The occurrence of the word yavan\u0101n\u012b in 4.1.49, referring to a writing (lipi) c.q. cuneiform writing, or to Greek writing, suggests a date for P\u0101\u1e47ini after the 326 BCE Indian campaign of Alexander the Great. Cardona rejects this possibility, arguing that yavan\u0101n\u012b may also refer to a Yavana woman; and that Indians had contacts with the Greek world before Alexander's conquests.[33][note 3] Sutra 2.1.70 of P\u0101\u1e47ini mentions kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a, derived from \u015brama\u1e47a, which refers to a female renunciates, c.q. \"Buddhist nuns,\" implying that P\u0101\u1e47ini should be placed after Gautama Buddha. K. B. Pathak (1930) argued that kum\u0101ra\u015brama\u1e47a could also refer to a Jain nun, meaning that P\u0101\u1e47ini is not necessarily to be placed after the Buddha.[32]/nIt is not certain whether P\u0101\u1e47ini used writing for the composition of his work, though it is generally agreed that he knew of a form of writing, based on references to words such as lipi (\"script\") and lipikara (\"scribe\") in section 3.2 of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b.[36][37][38] The dating of the introduction of writing, to present day North West Pakistan, may therefore give further information on the dating of P\u0101\u1e47ini.[note 4]/nP\u0101\u1e47ini cites at least ten grammarians and linguists before him: \u0100pi\u015bali, K\u0101\u015byapa, G\u0101rgya, G\u0101lava, C\u0101kravarma\u1e47a, Bh\u0101radv\u0101ja, \u015a\u0101ka\u1e6d\u0101yana, \u015a\u0101kalya, Senaka, Spho\u1e6d\u0101yana and Yaska.[45] According to Kamal K.

In an inscription of Siladitya VII of Valabhi,[who?] he is called \u015aal\u0101turiya, which means \"man from Salatura\".[citation needed] This means Panini lived in Salatura of ancient Gandhara (present day north-west Pakistan), which likely was near Lahor, a town at the junction of Indus and Kabul rivers.[d][50][51] According to the memoirs of 7th-century Chinese scholar Xuanzang, there was a town called Suoluoduluo on the Indus where P\u0101\u1e47ini was born, and he composed the Qingming-lun (Sanskrit: Vy\u0101kara\u1e47a).[50][52][53]/nAccording to Hartmut Scharfe, P\u0101\u1e47ini lived in Gandhara close to the borders of the Achaemenid Empire, and Gandhara was then an Achaemenian satrapy following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley. He must, therefore, have been technically a Persian subject but his work shows no awareness of the Persian language.[6][54] According to Patrick Olivelle, P\u0101\u1e47ini's text and references to him elsewhere suggest that \"he was clearly a northerner, probably from the northwestern region\".[55]/nPanini is mentioned in Indian fables and ancient texts. The Panchatantra, for example, mentions that P\u0101\u1e47ini was killed by a lion.[56][57][58]/nP\u0101\u1e47ini was depicted on a five-rupee Indian postage stamp in August, 2004.[59][60][61][62]/nThe most important of P\u0101\u1e47ini's works, the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a grammar that essentially defines the Sanskrit language. Modelled on the dialect and register of elite speakers in his time, the text also accounts for some features of the older Vedic language./nThe A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is a prescriptive and generative grammar with algebraic rules governing every aspect of the language. It is supplemented by three ancillary texts: ak\u1e63arasam\u0101mn\u0101ya, dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha[A] and ga\u1e47ap\u0101\u1e6dha.[B][63]/nGrowing out of a centuries-long effort to preserve the language of the Vedic hymns from \"corruption\", the A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b is the high point of a vigorous, sophisticated grammatical tradition devised to arrest language change. The A\u1e63t\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b's preeminence is underlined by the fact that it eclipsed all similar works that came before: while not the first, it is the oldest such text surviving in its entirety.[64][65][66][67]/nThe A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b consists of 3,959 s\u016btras[C] in eight chapters, which are each subdivided into four sections or p\u0101das. The text takes material from lexical lists (dh\u0101tup\u0101\u1e6dha, ga\u1e47ap\u0101tha) as input and describes algorithms to be applied to them for the generation of well-formed words. Such is its intricacy that the correct application of its rules and metarules is still being worked out centuries later.[68][69]/nThe A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b, composed in an era when oral composition and transmission was the norm, is staunchly embedded in that oral tradition. In order to ensure wide dissemination, P\u0101\u1e47ini is said to have preferred brevity over clarity[70] - it can be recited end-to-end in two hours. This has led to the emergence of a great number of commentaries[\u03b1] of his work over the centuries, which for the most part adhere to the foundations laid by P\u0101\u1e47ini's work.[71][64]/nThe learning of Indian curriculum in late classical times had at its heart a system of grammatical study and linguistic analysis.[72] The core text for this study was the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b of P\u0101\u1e47ini, the sine qua non of learning.[73] This grammar of P\u0101\u1e47ini had been the object of intense study for the ten centuries prior to the composition of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya. It was plainly Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di's purpose to provide a study aid to P\u0101\u1e47ini's text by using the examples already provided in the existing grammatical commentaries in the context of the gripping and morally improving story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. To the dry bones of this grammar Bha\u1e6d\u1e6di has given juicy flesh in his poem. The intention of the author was to teach this advanced science through a relatively easy and pleasant medium. In his own words:/nThis composition is like a lamp to those who perceive the meaning of words and like a hand mirror for a blind man to those without grammar./nThis poem, which is to be understood by means of a commentary, is a joy to those sufficiently learned: through my fondness for the scholar I have here slighted the dullard./nBha\u1e6d\u1e6dik\u0101vya 22.33\u201334./nP\u0101\u1e47ini's work became known in 19th-century Europe, where it influenced modern linguistics initially through Franz Bopp, who mainly looked at P\u0101\u1e47ini.  Subsequently, a wider body of work influenced Sanskrit scholars such as Ferdinand de Saussure, Leonard Bloomfield, and Roman Jakobson. Frits Staal (1930\u20132012) discussed the impact of Indian ideas on language in Europe. After outlining the various aspects of the contact, Staal notes that the idea of formal rules in language\u00a0\u2013 proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1894 and developed by Noam Chomsky in 1957\u00a0\u2013 has origins in the European exposure to the formal rules of P\u0101\u1e47inian grammar.[74] In particular, de Saussure, who lectured on Sanskrit for three decades, may have been influenced by P\u0101\u1e47ini and Bhartrihari; his idea of the unity of signifier-signified in the sign somewhat resembles the notion of Spho\u1e6da. More importantly, the very idea that formal rules can be applied to areas outside of logic or mathematics may itself have been catalysed by Europe's contact with the work of Sanskrit grammarians.[74]/nP\u0101\u1e47ini, and the later Indian linguist Bhartrihari, had a significant influence on many of the foundational ideas proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure, professor of Sanskrit, who is widely considered the father of modern structural linguistics and with Charles S. Peirce on the other side, to semiotics, although the concept Saussure used was semiology. Saussure himself cited Indian grammar as an influence on some of his ideas. In his M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes (Memoir on the Original System of Vowels in the Indo-European Languages) published in 1879, he mentions Indian grammar as an influence on his idea that \"reduplicated aorists represent imperfects of a verbal class.\" In his De l'emploi du g\u00e9nitif absolu en sanscrit (On the Use of the Genitive Absolute in Sanskrit) published in 1881, he specifically mentions P\u0101\u1e47ini as an influence on the work.[75]/nPrem Singh, in his foreword to the reprint edition of the German translation of P\u0101\u1e47ini's Grammar in 1998, concluded that the \"effect Panini's work had on Indo-European linguistics shows itself in various studies\" and that a \"number of seminal works come to mind,\" including Saussure's works and the analysis that \"gave rise to the laryngeal theory,\" further stating: \"This type of structural analysis suggests influence from Panini's analytical teaching.\" George Cardona, however, warns against overestimating the influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini on modern linguistics: \"Although Saussure also refers to predecessors who had taken this Paninian rule into account, it is reasonable to conclude that he had a direct acquaintance with Panini's work. As far as I am able to discern upon rereading Saussure's M\u00e9moire, however, it shows no direct influence of Paninian grammar. Indeed, on occasion, Saussure follows a path that is contrary to Paninian procedure.\"[75][76]/nThe founding father of American structuralism, Leonard Bloomfield, wrote a 1927 paper titled \"On some rules of P\u0101\u1e47ini\".[77]/nRishi Rajpopat elaborated in 2021 in his PhD thesis[78] a deeper understanding of Panini's \"language machine\" by designing a simple system of resolving rule conflicts.[79][80]/nP\u0101\u1e47ini's grammar is the world's first formal system, developed well before the 19th century innovations of Gottlob Frege and the subsequent development of mathematical logic. In designing his grammar, P\u0101\u1e47ini used the method of \"auxiliary symbols\", in which new affixes are designated to mark syntactic categories and the control of grammatical derivations.[clarification needed] This technique, rediscovered by the logician Emil Post, became a standard method in the design of computer programming languages.[81][82] Sanskritists now accept that P\u0101\u1e47ini's linguistic apparatus is well-described as an \"applied\" Post system.  Considerable evidence shows ancient mastery of context-sensitive grammars, and a general ability to solve many complex problems. Frits Staal has written that \"Panini is the Indian Euclid.\"[citation needed]/nTwo literary works are attributed to P\u0101\u1e47ini, though they are now lost./nThere are many mathematical works related to P\u0101\u1e47ini's works. P\u0101\u1e47ini came up with a plethora of ideas to organize the known grammatical forms of his day in a systematic way. Like any mathematician who models a known phenomenon in mathematical language, P\u0101\u1e47ini created a metalanguage and it is very close to the modern-day ideas of algebra.

He invested brilliantly in the stock market, selling out shortly before the 1929 crash and buying in close to the bottom. Hurwitz left his considerable financial estate to the U. of Missouri, Harvard, and Cornell.[1]", "35718248": "Ioan Mire Melik, or Melic (born Iacob Ioan Miren Melik;[1] August 9, 1840 \u2013 January 29, 1889), was a Wallachian, later Romanian mathematician, educator and political figure, one of the early members of Junimea literary society. Known for his work in private education, and for his tenure at the University of Ia\u0219i, he was the author of several early introductions to science\u2014dealing with arithmetic and geometry, but also with topography and surveying. He was perceived as a bland figure at Junimea meetings, and had little to do with its literary agenda, but took care of administrative chores and, for a while, of its publishing venture. In his other job as headmaster of Institutele-Unite high school, where he employed poet Mihai Eminescu as a German-language teacher, he was regarded as remarkably stern, and had a publicized showdown with the students./nTaking his cue from the Junimist leadership, Melik followed the literary club as it transformed itself into a liberal conservative party. He represented Ia\u0219i city in the Assembly of Deputies in the 1884 legislature, and then, under a Junimist government, helped enforce Titu Maiorescu's policies in the educational field. Melik is also remembered as an engineer and entrepreneur, who contributed to the modern history of Coste\u0219tii Boto\u0219anilor village, his personal estate. He died of an unspecified disease at age 48, and was survived by his son Eugen, who folowed in his footsteps as both a politician and an academic. Melik Jr was a leader of the Democratic Nationalist Party during and after World War I, but disappeared from public life after being exposed and sentenced as a confidence man./nThe future scientist was born in Bucharest, the Wallachian capital, on August 9, 1840 (although traditionally believed to have been born on August 15[1] or August 21,[2] and wrongly credited in some documents as a \"Ia\u0219i native\").[3] He was of Armenian origins: the Meliks traced their origin to Ohan, a Gregorian Armenian clergyman.[1] As reported by the mathematician's son Eugen, they were recent immigrants from the Ottoman Empire, who had been scattered across the continents by mounting persecutions against their community; Boghos Yousefian, the Foreign Minister of Ottoman Egypt, was a close relative of the clan.[4] Ioan's parents were Ohan's son, Arakel \"Popovici\" Melik, and his wife Maria Gedik; they had two other children: Gavril, a boy, and Anika, a girl.[1] Ohan's other son, Iacob Melic, was a successful architect. The Ottoman statesman Mustafa Reshid Pasha recommended his work to the Wallachian government, but Iacob left the country and settled in Paris.[5] From his new home, Iacob Melik corresponded with the exiled leaders of the 1848 Revolution, in particular the moderate and pro-Ottoman faction of Ion Ghica, Alexandru G. Golescu and Nicolae Ple\u0219oianu.[6]/nTo the end of his life, Ioan was listed as having \"Armenian Gregorian nationality\".[7] According to his own testimony, he first attended the Armenian School in Bucharest's Yellow District, and then regular school in that same neighborhood.[1] From 1854 to 1856, he completed secondary school at the Saint Sava College and was, in his own account, an award-winning student.[1] From 1856, Iacob Melik took over the boy's education, taking him to Imperial France. Young Melik was tutored at a private boarding house (1857), before enlisting at the University of Paris Medical School, but changed his mind and applied for the \u00c9cole des Mines de Paris (1860).[1] He finished school in 1864, and worked for a short while at salt mines in France and Belgium.[1]/nMelik's work took him to Moldavia, which, in 1859, had federated with Wallachia into the United Principalities. The regime of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza assigned him to inspect the Moldavian salt mines, at Sl\u0103nic and T\u00e2rgu Ocna.[1] Known to his Ia\u0219i colleagues and friends as Mirmilic,[8] he began attending the Junimea club in 1865, being one of the outside sympathizers of the cause, and manifestly lacking literary ambitions. Iacob Negruzzi, the Junimea co-founder and biographer of its members, asserted: \"[Melik was] once a passionate Junimist, but always kept silent.\"[1][9] Negruzzi jokingly added that the standard estimate, according to which the maths teacher had uttered some 23 words at club meetings held between 1865 and 1880, was probably exaggerated in Melik's favor.[9] Literary historian George C\u0103linescu suggests that Melik, like astronomer Niculae Culianu or schoolteacher Pavel Paicu, only came to Junimea \"out of devotion or for the sake of entertainment\".[10] The mathematician was notorious for not having published a single line in the Junimist tribune, Convorbiri Literare.[1][8][9][11]/nWith his Junimist credentials, Melik was made substitute Professor of Mathematics at Ia\u0219i University (February 23, 1865).[1][8] In parallel, he taught at a high school for young cadets.[7] During October 1865, he joined a group of academics, also comprising Rector Titu Maiorescu, museum organizer Gheorghe Panaiteanu Bardasare, Culianu, and Negruzzi, in expressing support for Cuza's autonomous interpretation of Romanian vassalage\u2014namely, his attitude toward the Ottoman overlords. Their open letter congratulated the Domnitor for not accepting to be scolded by Grand Vizier Fuad.[12] Melik acquired university tenure in April 1866, shortly after Cuza's regime had been toppled by the \"monstrous coalition\" and replaced by a Princely Lieutenancy.[1] In May, he was caught up in the riots at Ia\u0219i, whereby the Free and Independent Faction signaled its opposition to a proposed naturalization of resident Jews. In a letter to Rom\u00e2nul, Melik explained that he did not support the Factionalist platform, but had merely objected to the riots being quashed by the Romanian Land Forces, which reportedly ignored academic freedom. His protest against the arrest of a university colleague resulted in his temporary arrest, ending when the rectorate intervened in his favor.[13]/nSoon after, Melik became a conservative ally of the Junimist Rector Maiorescu, helping him do battle with the University's well connected Factionalists and the other left-liberal groups. As noted C\u0103linescu, the University's Junimist circle was formed around Professors Melik, Culianu, I. Neguzzi, Ioan Caragiani and Nicolae Mandrea, with Junimea itself being \"a political get-together with some cultural aspects.\"[14] Although still recognized as a secondary and inactive participant, Melik was involved on several early Junimist projects, and referred to by Maiorescu as the group's \"banker\".[1][9] In addition to promoting Junimist goals at University, he participated in founding (and financing) the club's own private school, or \"Academic Institute\". He himself described the event as follows: \"In summer 1866, I have founded the Academic Institute, in partnership with several colleagues, from both University and High School [that is, the National High School Ia\u0219i].\"[1] Melik took personal care about furnishing the Institute, purchasing its books from prestigious companies such as Hachette, and keeping score of the more reliable publishing houses in Moldavia and Wallachia.[1]/nThe institution itself left a mark on Romanian educational history, being seen as a model school in the field of private enterprise.[1][15] It remains primarily noted for its contribution in Humanities, which were assigned to Maiorescu. Constantin Meissner, the dedicated student and future Junimist pedagogue, recalled: \"we [students] found ourselves speaking, gesticulating, moving our heads just like our precious model [Maiorescu].\"[16] Another former student, and later teacher at the Institute, was scholar A. D. Xenopol. He describes his alma mater as \"an eminent private school\", and Melik as one of the \"leading professorial forces\" in Moldavia; he also credits Melik's \"complete and measured exactitude\" as influential for his own work ethic.[11] According to Xenopol, Melik's refusal to tolerate staff truancy earned him a reputation as a strict colleague. Referencing an Armenian stereotype, the other Junimists began calling Melik a mindirigiu (\"quilter\") of their absences.[11]/nMelik was, with Vasile Pogor and Al. Farra, a manager of the literary club's own publishing company\u2014a bankrupt project, since Pogor would only purchase books from his own area of interest.[17] Before going down, this commercial branch of Junimea put out a number of general education works, including Melik's textbook Elemente de aritmetic\u0103 (\"Elements of Arithmetic\").[18] Melik was also a cashier during Junimea anniversaries.[1][9] Witnessing the decline of Junimist capital, he even proposed, unsuccessfully, that the club fortunes be invested in a salt mine.[1] Melik was not dissuaded by the opposition, and continued to draft plans about investing Junimist money, forming a credit union, and opening up the Humpel girls' institute.[1][9] His record of Junimea gains and expenses is seen by philologist Constantin Coroiu as evidence of Melik's \"computer-like rigor\".[9] According to Negruzzi, Melik was an outstandingly passionate defender of Maiorescu's reputation. When the Junimist leader was framed a statutory rape scandal and taken to court, Melik provoked the judge to a duel, over not being allowed to enter the courthouse.[1][9]/nOn February 18, 1867, the Junimist mathematician was also admitted into the conservative wing of Romanian Freemasonry, or \"Star of Romania\" Lodge. This branch of the Oriental Rite of Memphis and the Grand Orient de France, wherein Pogor himself had reached the 90th Degree, had for its Iorgu Sutzu as its Venerable Master, and came to include most of the Junimist notabilities.[2][3] On October 21 of the same year, Melik was granted the Fellow Craft Rank in Masonic orders.[1][9] Noting the role of Junimist Masons in combating the liberals' stated xenophobia, researcher Mihai Dim. Sturdza suggests that the \"Star of Romania\" was in fact \"a place of refuge, [...] where the foreign-born intellectuals [...] created a bloc with the conservative boyars and the Jewish merchants\".[2] Their main liberal detractors included senior academic Simion B\u0103rnu\u021biu and other outspoken antisemites.[2][3]/nMelik's 1867 arithmetic course was highly popular, going through ten reprints.[1] He followed up with other textbooks and introductory courses: Despre moneta rom\u00e2n\u0103 (\"On the Romanian Currency\", 1868); Elemente de Geometrie (\"Elements of Geometry\", 1869, ten reprints); Elemente de Topografie (\"Elements of Topography\", 1879, four reprints).[1] From 1883 to 1888, Melik, Culianu and Constantin Climescu put out the magazine Recrea\u021bii \u0218tiin\u021bifice (\"Scientific Recreations\"), considered a direct precursor of the more prestigious Gazeta Matematic\u0103.[19] The author continued his work at the Institute before and after 1875, when it merged with the \"New High School\" into the private-run Institutele-Unite (\"Unified Institutes\");[1] according to the former student Eugeniu Vincler, the complete merger only took place in 1879.[20]/nAlso in 1875, Melik formalized his adoption by Ia\u0219i city, by beginning construction work on a townhouse (completed 1882).[1] He married a local, Roxandra.[21] The new Domnitor, Carol I, recognized Melik's educational merits by granting him the Bene Merenti medal 1st class.[1][22] However, according to Vincler, he was a \"stern\" headmaster, and managed to alienate the students by bringing in Mihai Eminescu to serve as their tutor in German; they resented Eminescu because of his cantankerousness and his harsh grading of students.[23] A small-scale student revolt, which involved future socialist agitators Constantin Mille and Vasile Mor\u021bum, was curbed by Melik.[24] According to one anecdotal account, he bent their will by ordering the cafeteria not to provide them with any food for the duration of their strike.[25] Reflecting back on his participation in the scandal, Vincler expressed shame, noting that Eminescu had since been discovered as a poetic genius, and elevated into the national pantheon.[26] Mille himself was spared expulsion after a personal interview with Melik, whom he knew, derisively, as Musta\u021b\u0103-Ro\u0219ie (\"Red Mustache\").[27]/nMelik was a distant witness to the Romanian War of Independence (1877\u20131878), which saw the country cut off her remaining ties of vassalage with the Ottoman monarchy; he collected the letters sent home by his relative, Captain Grigore B\u0103nulescu, who had fought at Plevna.[28] Shortly after the establishment of the Romanian Kingdom in 1881, Melik also made his way into the Junimist political party. Maiorescu, who led Junimea members in and out of the opposition Conservative Party, assigned him a place on the independent list for Ia\u0219i in the election of 1884. In practice, Melik, Pogor, Negruzzi and others were in a cartel with the ruling National Liberals, and were elected deputies on a united pro-government list.[29] A while after, with Premier Ion Br\u0103tianu ignoring repeated Junimist requests for cabinet positions, the entire faction moved back into the opposition.[30] Carol I, the newly crowned King of Romania, again rewarded Melik's services: in February 1884, Monitorul Oficial published news that the mathematician had been made Officer of the Order of the Star of Romania; when later errata informed Melik that he was merely a Knight of that company, he refused to accept the award altogether.[1]/nMelik had given up his position as headmaster in 1884, when Climescu took over.[31] He was still an active popularizer on scientific topics, publishing, in 1885, a surveying and ballistics tract: Equerulu grafometru sau quadrantulu de campania al D-lui Colonel de Artilerie A. Costiescu (\"The Graphometer or Campaign Quadrant of the Artillery Colonel A. Costiescu\").[1] In 1888, he issued three new textbooks: Arithmetic for 3rd- and 4th-graders, Geometry for the primary course, and a Curs practic de Geometrie elementar\u0103 (\"Practical Course in Elementary Geometry\").[1] By then, he had invested his money into a large-scale agricultural venture, on the Moldavian estate of Coste\u0219tii Boto\u0219anilor. The purchase took place in March 1885. As he himself noted, 507 f\u00e1lce of land (some 726 hectares) were exchanged for his 210,000 lei, cash.[1] This was a third of the estate, as defined by tradition, and a half of the actual village.[32]/nIn March 1888, after prolonged political infighting, Carol I turned his back on both the Conservatives and the National Liberals. The Junimists experienced a moment of triumph, with Theodor Rosetti as Premier and Maiorescu as Education Minister. For a while, Melik himself was Secretary General of the Education Ministry, his position at the University filled in by Ion Ralet.[1] The Junimist loyalist was assigned by Maiorescu to inspect the Moldavian schools. Their common goal was to purge from the schooling system a new political threat: socialist activists. Melik was ordered to work only with the known anti-socialists, and to sack all those suspected of having affiliated with the socialist clubs.[9][33] In one such letter, the Minister instructs his subordinate to inquire about whether the known Marxist Ioan N\u0103dejde still had relatives working on a state salary.[9]/nIn early 1889, still active as General Inspector of the Schools and Principal of Institutele-Unite,[34] Melik was struck down with a quickly progressing illness. He died in his home at Ia\u0219i on January 29, and was buried with military honors at Eternitatea cemetery; despite his lifelong Gregorian faith, the funeral service was Romanian Orthodox, delivered by the local Archiereus, Irimia Gal\u0103\u021banu, at the Annunciation Church.[7] His death was perceived as a tragedy by his fellow Junimists. Poet Anton Naum wrote, shortly after the events, \"We have lost poor Melik in the space of 7 days, however good and healthy he had been. It left me with a hallowed heart, seeing that we were very close.\"[1] The same Naum took over Melik's job at the inspectorate, in March 1889.[35]/nMelik's brief obituary in Familia magazine informed readers that the inspector's schoolbooks had \"genuine value\";[34] a homage was rendered by Institutele-Unite in September 1891, upon its silver jubilee.[36] Later, the post-Junimist historiographer I. E. Torou\u021biu presented Melik as a highly moral man of action: \"He was one of the society's devoted members, without ever asking it for perks [or] advancements, even though he was in a position to demand them, under the governments of his political friends.\"[11] By 1978, when they were assigned entries in Ionel Maftei's dictionary of Ia\u0219i-themed biographies, Melik and Naum were reportedly among the \"picturesque and quite forgotten\" subclass of Junimists.[37]/nThe mathematician was survived by his widow and their four children, three of whom were daughters[7] (four other children had died in infancy).[1] Roxandra remained active as a philanthropist, and by 1908 was serving on the board of Maria Hinna's P\u00eenea S\u0103racilor charity.[38] One of daughters became the wife of Lieutenant Colonel Nicu Scor\u021bescu. A former student of her father, he served with distinction in World War I and died in 1924, while serving as head of the Romanian Police in Hotin County.[39] Ioan's only surviving son, Eugen, took over his papers.[1][4] Himself a graduate of Institutele-Unite,[40] he was assigned as that school's headmaster in August 1898.[41] He then became a substitute Law Professor at the University of Ia\u0219i, beginning in 1903. Unable to complete his Ph. D., and complaining about the criteria for academic advancement, he finally resigned in September 1920.[42] Melik Jr also built the towering landmark of Coste\u0219tii Boto\u0219anilor, a castle-shaped vacation home;[32] one half of the village is commonly known as Coste\u0219ti-Melic.[32]/nIn parallel, Eugen became an establishment politician, serving as a Conservative deputy for Boto\u0219ani County in 1911.[43] During the conflict opposing Petre P. Carp and Virgil Arion to Maiorescu, he sided with the former two and their \"neo-Junimist\" faction.[44] He finally defected to the National Liberal caucus in 1913.[45] During the second half of World War I, when southern Romania under German occupation, Melik was in Ia\u0219i, which functioned as a provisional capital of the rump Romanian state. He joined Nicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza's Democratic Nationalist Party (PND), and was designated a candidate for the Assembly in the scheduled elections of December 1918; his home also hosted the Committee for the Defense of Ia\u0219i Interests.[46]/nUpon the creation of Greater Romania, Melik Jr had become general secretary of the PND.[47] His political career was cut short when he acquired infamy as a confidence man: in June 1924, the Ilfov County tribunal found him guilty of several counts of fraud, after he had illegally obtained control of a Bucharest townhouse from his late aunt Anika. Litigation over this issue, which resulted in Melik being imprisoned for eight months, was initiated by the Armenian Church, as one of the legal successors.[48] In April 1932, he was again charged with fraud, due to his land speculation with Anika's estate in Tis\u0103u, and was ordered to pay reparations to his victims.[49] He was living in Boto\u0219ani in March 1940, witnessing there the death of his wife Elena; they had two daughters, Ioana and Nicoli\u021ba.[50] His mother Roxandra died in August 1942, while in monastic seclusion at Agapia Monastery, and was buried next to her husband, at Eternitatea.[21]", "7079021": "Jeremiah (Jerry) Farrell (December 12, 1937, in Hastings, Nebraska \u2013 July 4, 2022, in Indianapolis, Indiana)[1] was an American professor emeritus of mathematics at Butler University in Indiana.

Wang.[2]/nWang's research focused on the area of number theory, especially in the Goldbach conjecture, through sieve theory and the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. He obtained a series of important results in the field of number theory.[6][7]/nWith Hua Luogeng (\u534e\u7f57\u5e9a, alternatively Hua Loo-Keng), he developed high-dimensional combinatorial designs for numerical integration on the unit cube. Their work came to the attention of the statistician Kai-Tai Fang, who realized that their results could be used in the design of experiments. In particular, their results could be used to investigate interaction, for example, in factorial experiments and response surface methodology. Collaborating with Fang led to uniform designs, which have been used also in computer simulations.[8][9][10][11]", "30803079": "Ellen Amanda Hayes (September 23, 1851\u00a0\u2013 October 27, 1930) was an American mathematician and astronomer. She was a controversial figure, not only because of being a female college professor, but also for embracing many radical causes./nHayes was born in Granville, Ohio, the first of six children to Ruth Rebecca (Wolcott) Hayes and Charles Coleman Hayes.[1] At the age of seven she studied at the Centerville school, a one-room ungraded public school and, in 1867, at sixteen, was employed to teach at a country school.[1] In 1872, she entered the preparatory department at Oberlin College and was admitted as a freshman in 1875, where her main studies were mathematics and science.[1]/nThree years after admission, Hayes obtained bachelor's degree from Oberlin in 1878 and began teaching at Adrian College.[1] Also active in astronomy, she determined the orbit of the newly discovered asteroid 267 Tirza while studying at the Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia.[1]/nFrom 1879 until her retirement in 1916, Hayes taught at Wellesley College, where she became head of the mathematics department in 1888 and head of the new department in applied mathematics in 1897.[1] According to one of her colleagues, she was removed from being head of the mathematics department due to disputes over her admission policy.[1] Hayes wore utilitarian clothes instead of the fashionable garments worn by many women of the day and she was described as \"strong willed.\"[1]/nAs a mathematics professor, she was described as controversial. She questioned the truth of the Bible in front of students.[1] She had very high standards of education, giving more than half of her students D grades during the first year she taught from her trigonometry book.[1] Despite her rigorous teaching style, she had a loyal following of students.[1]/nIn 1888, Hayes wrote a regular column for the Wellesley College newspaper discussing women's suffrage and dress reform, and in the 1890s she founded a chapter of the temperance movement.[1]/nIn 1891, Hayes was elected one of the first six women to become members of the New York Mathematical Society (later the American Mathematical Society).[2] She was named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1905.[3]/nA history of Wellesley College reads:/nA dauntless radical all her days, in the eighties she was wearing short skirts; in the nineties she was a staunch advocate of Woman's Suffrage; in the first two decades of the twentieth century, an ardent Socialist. After her retirement, and until her death in 1930, she was actively connected with an experiment in adult education for working girls. Fearless, devoted, intransigent, fanatical, if you like, and at times a thorn in the flesh of the trustees, who withheld the title of Emeritus on her retirement, she is remembered with enthusiasm and affection by many of her students./nHayes was concerned about under-representation of women in mathematics and science and argued that this was due to social pressure, emphasis on female appearances, lack of employment opportunities for women in mathematics and science fields, and schools that allowed female students to opt out of mathematics and science courses.[1]/nHayes was a controversial figure not just for being one of the rare women among mathematics professors in nineteenth-century America, but for her embrace of radical causes such as questioning the Bible, gender-related clothing conventions, suffrage, temperance, socialism, the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike, and Sacco and Vanzetti case.[1]/nShe was the Socialist Party candidate for Massachusetts Secretary of State in 1912, the first woman in state history to run for statewide office.[1] She did not win the race, but did receive more votes than any Socialist candidate on the ballot, including 2500 more than for their gubernatorial candidate.[1] During the Russian Revolution, despite anti-Red sentiment, she raised money for Russian orphans and defended socialism.[1] At the age of 76, she was arrested for marching in protest of the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti.[1]/nHayes wrote Wild Turkeys and Tallow Candles (1920), an account of life in Granville, \u201cHow Do You Know? A Handbook of Evidence and Inference\u201d (1923) and The Sycamore Trail (1929), a historical novel.[2]/nIn 1929, she moved to West Park, New York to teach at Vineyard Shore School for women workers in industry, despite her pain from arthritis.[1] She died on October 27, 1930.[1] Her will left her brain to the Wilder Brain Collection at Cornell University. Her ashes were buried in Granville, Ohio.[1]", "29262983": "Justus Velsius, Haganus, or Joost Welsens in Dutch (c. 1510, The Hague, Low Countries[notes 1] \u2013 after 1581 at an unknown location), was a Dutch humanist, physician, and mathematician./nVelsius started his career as a highly respected professor of liberal arts in Leuven, Strasbourg, and Cologne. Later on he portrayed himself as a prophet, and promoted his own particular view of Christianity, outlined in a pamphlet \"Christiani Hominis Norma\" which he wrote in London. He came into conflict with civil and ecclesiastical authorities all over Europe, and spent his final years as a preacher and faith healer in his native Holland. While in Cologne Velsius was married to Beatrix van Steenhoven, and later on, in Groningen, to Grete Cassens./nAfter studying arts and medicine in Bologna, Velsius graduated as doctor medicinae in 1538 and settled down as physician in Antwerp, 1540/41. In 1541 he moved to Leuven, where he met Portuguese humanist Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is,[2] and maintained friendly relations with Vesalius.[3] Even though Velsius did not have a university position he held public lectures in Greek, Latin, philosophy and mathematics. In 1544 he proposed a course on Trebizond's Dialectica. The authorities balked, and in the ensuing controversy they forced Velsius, whose theological purity was suspect, out of the university.[4] In 1542 he had failed in his bid to succeed Nannius, and he moved to Strasbourg in 1544 at the recommendation of Bucer, after a short teaching stint at the Marburg Latin School and possibly in Basel./nFrom Easter 1544-50 Velsius taught dialectic and Aristotelian ethics in the higher grades of the gymnasium in Strasbourg, as a co-worker of Johannes Sturm. On 17 November 1545 he received a canonicate at St. Thomas collegiate church, through the mediation of Bucer. Sometime before 17 October 1548 he married Beatrix van Steenhoven. When Velsius got in trouble because he accepted the Interim and the resulting conflict with his Protestant colleagues, he moved to Cologne in the spring of 1550; he probably only gave up his Strasbourg canonicate in 1553./nVelsius matriculated at Cologne on 3 June 1550. The Council of Cologne wanted to build a Trilingual school following the example of the University of Leuven, and appointed Velsius professor of philosophy and Greek, in August 1550. Since Velsius was married, he could not obtain a university prebend, but was instead remunerated by the council. His compensation was increased in 1551 and 1552, and he was charged with teaching mathematics as well. Velsius and his colleague Jakob Leichius, who was instrumental in establishing the Gymnasium Tricoronatum, drafted guidelines for a curriculum of eight grades, similar to Sturm's humanistic curriculum in Strasbourg./nVelsius attended the meetings of the Anabaptists in the Bookbinder's Guildhall at the Pfaffengasse,[5] where he met Anabaptist martyr Thomas von Imbroich.[6] Velsius' philosophical writings, in particular the work of Krisis[works 11] led to suspicion of heresy.[7] On 29 October 1554 Krisis was condemned by Cologne University, and Velsius' teaching license revoked (11 December 1554, confirmed 29 March 1555), since he did not distance himself from his writing. Emperor Charles V, who had become involved at the instigation of the cathedral chapter, the clergy and the university, urged the council in vain to take action against Velsius, who on 25 March 1555 had published a defense, Epistola ad Ferdinandum.[works 14] Only after Velsius attempted to give theological lectures at his home, and rejected the Eucharistic adoration and celibacy, did the magistrate banish him in April 1555./nVelsius refused to leave, and went voluntarily in detention, from December 1555 to the end of March 1556. He asked his influential friend Viglius to support him, but Viglius declined to get involved. Greatly offended by this refusal, Velsius apparently accused his friend of Protestant leanings, and severed all connections with his former friend. Because of this precedent the council adopted in 1555 a comprehensive directive against all heretics./nThe Dominican Johannes Slotanus served as papal inquisitor for the Ecclesiastical province of Mainz, Cologne and Trier against Velsius and three other imprisoned people, whom he described as Anabaptists. The Protestant Princes intervened at the council on his behalf, in particular Christoph von Oldenburg. Since in December 1555 he had declared to adhere to the Augsburg Confession, Velsius was protected by the recently concluded Peace of Augsburg. On the night of 26 to 27 March 1556 he was taken by boat across the river and put ashore on the other side, in the Duchy of Berg. From there he made it to M\u00fclheim, where he wrote Apologia, addressed to the Emperor Charles and King Ferdinand.[works 15] Slotanus replied in 1557 with the Apologia JV Hagani Confutatio.[8] In response Velsius wrote in September 1557 the Epistolae.[works 16] 1558 followed Slotanus' Disputationes adversus haereticos liber unus.[9]/nVelsius arrived in Frankfurt on 15 July 1556,[10] approached Robert Horne, pastor of the English Church, and informed him of the revelations on which he wished to conduct a public dispute. Hearing of the arrival of Calvin, who came to arbitrate conflicts within the French Refugee Church, he offered the latter to preside. He proposed to defend the free will against the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. The debate with Calvin, Johannes \u00e0 Lasco and Horne lasted two days; Velsius' argument boiled down to this: aut esse liberum arbitrium, aut Deum tyrannum esse (Either there is free will, or God is a tyrant)./nIn a letter addressed to Melanchthon, dated 17 September 1556, Calvin commented as follows:/nI have been dragged hither by the dissensions with which Satan has rent, for nearly two years, the little French church established here, and reduced to such extremities that it must have disappeared, unless some remedy had been very promptly applied. Since I entered the town I have not had a moment's repose, and as if I had not had sufficient occupation in this affair, a madman called Velsius, to whom you had written twice, involved us in new fooleries. But we have devoted only two days to this importunity. I am continually distracted up to this moment, in appeasing those dissentions which, from the long lapse of time, have struck deep root.[11]/nOn 15 April 1557 Velsius was expelled by the Council of Frankfurt./nOn 5 August 1557 Velsius matriculated at Heidelberg,[1][12] and obtained a license to give public lectures in philosophy. In June 1558 this license was revoked by the Senate of the University at the orders of Kurf\u00fcrst Ottheinrich because he spread theses that were against the Holy Scriptures. Velsius attacked the pastor of the Heiliggeistkirche, Johann Flinner, on his position on the Eucharist, sent him a series of theses on new birth and free will, and accused the pastor of being a false apostle and misleader of the prince and people.[13] In November 1559 he was also disallowed to give private lectures, after intervention of Kurf\u00fcrst Friedrich III, and was expelled by the Senate of the University. Velsius shook the dust off his shoes[14] as he left.[15]/nIn 1560 Velsius was back in Frankfurt. He asked the council for permission to have a book printed he had written die Summa christlicher Lehre und Lebens (The Summary of Christian Doctrine and Life). The council referred his request to the Lutheran pastors, who on 2 August 1560 reported back that his book contained theses that were against orthodox doctrine. They also expressed concern that these doctrines could lead to unrest in the foreign churches in the city,[16] as had happened in M\u00fcnster. On 18 March 1561 the council ordered Velsius to leave the city, since he had his book printed without permission. The innkeeper where he was boarding, Hansen Braun, was told to no longer allow him to stay in his house.[17]/nIn May 1561 Velsius was in Strasbourg. He wrote to Flinner (who had returned from Heidelberg) and the preachers, and to the council as well, submitting 20 propositions, probably the same ones as he announced in Heidelberg and in Frankfurt. These were not accepted, since they disagreed with the catechism then in use in Strasbourg./nA month later, in June 1561, Velsius was in Basel. He was luckier there, at least he could count on Sebastian Castellio, with whom he had corresponded before, and advocates of tolerance such as Cellarius and Celio Secondo Curione. He submitted a summary to the Council of the University, who considered it on 16 June. The council forwarded it to the Faculty of Theology, since it was outside their area of expertise. Cellarius proposed a number of theses for an academic disputation, but Velsius declined after the council had refused a public debate./nOn 25 June Velsius departed for Z\u00fcrich, where he arrived the next day. He wrote to the council, and Bullinger responded on behalf of the council, pointing out that his criticism didn't apply since it was directed at Luther and at the Roman Catholic Church. On 4 July Velsius had left town./nOn 1 August Velsius was back in Heidelberg, where he wrote a last time to Bonifacius Amerbach and to Johannes Sturm. He matriculated in Marburg at the end of August 1561, where he lectured at the medical school. However, he remained only a few months in Marburg./nIn 1563, Velsius had crossed the Channel to England where he joined the Dutch Church in London. Again he sought controversy, this time with Nicolaus Carinaeus, the minister of the Dutch refugee church, who had died from the plague in September 1563.[18][19][20] Carinaeus had explained his thoughts about regeneration through Christ. Velsius opposed him publicly developing at length his idea that the perfection of Adam could be reached on earth after inner rebirth had taken place in the individual. Velsius wrote a summary of his religion Christiani Hominis Norma (The Rule of a Christian Man), in which he explained his notion that through regeneration man could become God-in-man, like Christ. He sent copies of this pamphlet to the Bishop of London Edmund Grindal, to Secretary of State William Cecil, and to Queen Elizabeth./nHe also wrote a letter to the French Ambassador denouncing the vengeance of God on all who refused to receive his propositions.[21] In his letter to the Queen, Velsius claimed to have confirmed his calling by performing miracles. The servant to the ambassador, Cosmus, fasted five or six days by Velsius' persuasion that after his abstinence he might receive illuminations a c\u0153lo. According to Grindal in the end he fell mad, so neither of those miracles stood the test of further investigation. Bishop Grindal wrote a rebuttal, showing that Velsius' teachings were against orthodox doctrine. Velsius was summoned before the ecclesiastical commission, consisting of Bishop Grindal, the Bishop of Winchester Robert Horne, and the Dean of St. Paul's Alexander Nowell, who had a frank discussion with him, and charged him in the Queen's name to leave the kingdom. This he complained of in very rude words to the Queen, and predicted the death of the bishop of Winchester and other important public figures.[notes 2]/nVelsius returned to his native Holland, in April 1566 he was Groningen. In 1574 he was in prison there,[22] presumably because of religious reasons. The authorities felt sorry for him, because he was an elderly gentleman, and apparently depressed. They therefore proposed to release him, also because of the hardship imprisonment caused him and his wife Grete Cassens, as they had to provide for his own cost of living. The proposal was considered by the Stadtholder de Robles, who had a conversation with Velsius, and referred it to the bishop, who charged the dean of the cathedral to look into it. On 24 August 1574 the bishop endorsed Velsius' release. However, Velsius refused to leave prison, because he only wanted to be released by God's grace, not by human intervention. This unusual situation lasted until May 1575, when de Robles required the jail to be vacated, since the adjacent castle had to be strengthened and readied for the garrison./nIn April 1570 he was again in Cologne and then traveled through the Netherlands as a Protestant preacher. In 1578, 1580 and 1581, he was in Leiden./nVelsius published the Greek text of Proclus's De Motu (On Motion), along with a Latin translation.[works 5]/nJustus Velsius is interesting because his life reflects so well the unsettled intellectual conditions of 16th-century Europe. His theological profile in the religious landscape is not clearly defined: first, he did not agree with Luther's dogma of \"sola fide\" and instead held on to the free will of man; on the other hand, he supported the Lutheran Eucharist and rejected transubstantiation. Also, Velsius cannot be identified as Anabaptist, and is distinct from Spiritualism. What sets Velsius apart is that he taught justification by new birth, not by forgiveness of sins. He thought of himself as a messenger of God, sent to warn people for eternal damnation, and claimed to be able to confirm his teachings by miracles./nIt has been suggested that Velsius may have known Servetus, since both were close to Vesalius. Velsius' position about predestination is reminiscent of Servetus', and it is noteworthy that the Calvin-Velsius disputation on this subject took place less than three years after Servetus was executed outside Geneva. Rembert suggests that Velsius may have known Flemish Anabaptist religious reformer Johann Campanus, or at the very least that they were aware of each other's work./nVelsius' teachings appear to be related to those of the Family of Love. Velsius was a contemporary of Hendrik Niclaes, the founder of the Family of Love, and it seems likely that they may have known each other.", "26248333": "John Ralph Alexander Giles (Alex) Abercrombie (1949 - 2023)[1] was a British pianist, composer, and mathematician./nHailing from London, Abercrombie's parents were Nigel Abercrombie, Professor of French at Magdelen College and later a distinguished writer and civil servant and General Secretary of the Arts Council from 1963\u201368, and Elisabeth Abercrombie, an operatic soprano.[2] Educated at Worth and the Royal College of Music, he gave his professional debut recital at the Purcell Room in London in 1972.[1]/nHe studied the piano with Margaret Kitchin and in the early 1970s moved to Paris to study with Yvonne Loriod specialising in the works of her husband Olivier Messiaen and his pupils.

In 1906 he was appointed an academic assistant in analytic and projective geometry at the University of Rome.[3] He was also a professor ordinarius at the commercial institute \"Luigi di Savoia - Duca degli Abruzzi\" in Rome.  At the University of Rome he became a libero docente (lecturer) on rational mechanics, i.e. classical mechanics as a mathematical system based on axioms. At the beginning of his career he did research on number theory, but he soon began to specialize in rational mechanics. His research dealt with the classification of the types of holonomic systems and the three-body problem.[4]/nBisconcini was one of the professors conducting the Universit\u00e0 clandestina di Roma (1941\u20131943), which was organized by Guido Castelnuovo to teach secret university courses to Jews and disfavored opponents of fascism.[5]/nAccording to Daniel Buchanan:/nLevi-Civita showed that in the case of the restricted problem (one mass infinitesimal, the finite masses moving in circles) it is possible to determine the character of the motion near collision without difficulty and that the only singularities are branch-points. This was later shown by Bisconcini to be the case in the general problem when the three masses are finite, but he made an assumption which seemed evident but which he was unable to prove, viz., that the angular velocity of the radius vector of two bodies which collide remains finite as the time approaches the instant of collision. The contribution made by Sundman which marked the climax of the solution of the problem was to substantiate the assumption made by Bisconcini. While no attempt should be made to belittle the profound results of Sundman, it must be stated that they are disappointing as they give no information concerning the properties of the motion and are unsuitable for practical applications.[2]/nAccording to June Barrow-Green:/nBisconcini's result was important, but it did not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem. In the first place, his solution involved a complicated power series that was not all easy to use. But rather more problematic was the fact the series was only applicable when the interval of the time between the start of the motion and the collision was sufficiently short, and he gave no conditions for the latter condition, So there was still a need both to simplify the solution and to increase the range of its application. Moreover, Bisconcini had considered only the problem of a binary collision and not that of a triple collision.[6]", "62784683": "Pauline E.

He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes\u2013no questions can never be answered by computation. He defined a Turing machine and proved that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University./nDuring the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.[10][11]/nAfter the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers[12] and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[13][1] and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.[14]/nTuring was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. \nFollowing a public campaign in 2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the government for \"the appalling way [Turing] was treated\". Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous pardon in 2013. The term \"Alan Turing law\" is now used informally to refer to a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.[15]/nTuring has an extensive legacy with statues of him and many things named after him, including an annual award for computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England \u00a350 note, which was released on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century./nTuring was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service (ICS) of the British Raj government at Chatrapur, then in the Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.[16][17] Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.\u00a0John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was Ethel Sara Turing (n\u00e9e\u00a0Stoney), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.[18] Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at Bartholomew's church on Clyde Road, in Dublin.[19]/nJulius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to Maida Vale,[20] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[21][22] later the Colonnade Hotel.[16][23] Turing had an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets.[24]/nTuring's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom[25] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with a blue plaque.[26] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.[27]/nVery early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.[28] His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[29]/nTuring's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, from the age of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting that she has \"...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is a genius\".[30]/nBetween January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[31] In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School,[32] an independent boarding school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain, but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97\u00a0km) from Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[33]/nTuring's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school\".[34] Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.[35]/nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13 July 1911 \u2013 13 February 1930),[36] who has been described as Turing's first love.[37][38][39] Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.[40][41][42]/nThe event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances Isobel Morcom (n\u00e9e Swan), Turing wrote:/nI am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me\u00a0... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.[43]/nTuring's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday.[44] A day before the third anniversary of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom:/nI expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.[45]/nSome have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.[46] Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote:/nPersonally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body\u00a0... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.[47][48]/nAfter graduating from Sherborne, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B (that is, a three-year Parts I and II, of the Mathematical Tripos, with extra courses at the end of the third year, as Part III only emerged as a separate degree in 1934) from February 1931 to November 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. His dissertation, On the Gaussian error function, written during his senior year and delivered in November 1934 (with a deadline date of 6 December) proved a version of the central limit theorem. It was finally accepted on 16 March 1935. By spring of that same year, Turing started his master's course (Part III)\u2014which he completed in 1937\u2014and, at the same time, he published his first paper, a one-page article called Equivalence of left and right almost periodicity (sent on 23 April), featured in the tenth volume of the Journal of the London Mathematical Society.[49] Later that year, Turing was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of his dissertation.[50] However, and, unknown to Turing, this version of the theorem he proved in his paper, had already been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. Despite this, the committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship. Abram Besicovitch's report for the committee went so far as to say that if Turing's work had been published before Lindeberg's, it would have been \"an important event in the mathematical literature of that year\".[51][52][53]/nBetween the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as Church, Turing worked on the decidability of problems, starting from Godel's incompleteness theorems. In mid-April 1936, Turing sent Max Newman the first draft typescript of his investigations. That same month, Alonzo Church published his An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory, with similar conclusions to Turing's then-yet unpublished work. Finally, on 28 May of that year, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\".[54] It was published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December.[55] In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt G\u00f6del's 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing G\u00f6del's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called \"easily the most influential math paper in history\".[56]/nAlthough Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus,[57] Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.[58] It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Church\u2013Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.[59] To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.[60]/nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,[4] in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.[61] In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;[62] his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,[63][64] introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to the United Kingdom.[65]/nWhen Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.[66] The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.[67] Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.[68]/nDuring the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, \"You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius.\"[69]/nFrom September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.[70] Soon after the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages, Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.[71] The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement on the Polish Bomba).[72]/nOn 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.[73] Like all others who came to Bletchley, he was required to sign the Official Secrets Act, in which he agreed not to disclose anything about his work at Bletchley, with severe legal penalties for violating the Act.[74]/nSpecifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure dubbed Banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes; developing a procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) cipher machine and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.[75][76]/nBy using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography[77] and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,[78] which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, \"who identified himself only as Richard,\" said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted under the Official Secrets Act for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:[79]/n[He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted \"shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject\". ... The papers detailed using \"mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible\". ... Richard said that GCHQ had now \"squeezed the juice\" out of the two papers and was \"happy for them to be released into the public domain\"./nTuring had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as \"Prof\" and his treatise on Enigma was known as the \"Prof's Book\".[80][81] According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:/nIn the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.[82]/nPeter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his \"Reminiscences of Bletchley Park\" from A Century of Mathematics in America:[83]/nIt is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement.\nAlan Turing was such a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created by the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us./nHilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets.[84]/nWhile working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64\u00a0km) to London when he was needed for meetings,[85] and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.[86][87] Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, but he was hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.[88][89][90] When asked why he ran so hard in training he replied:/nI have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it's the only way I can get some release.[91]/nDue to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the war.[92] However, official war historian Harry Hinsley estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14\u00a0million lives.[93]/nAt the end of the war, a memo was sent to all those who had worked at Bletchley Park, reminding them that the code of silence dictated by the Official Secrets Act did not end with the war but would continue indefinitely.[74] Thus, even though Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1946 by King George VI for his wartime services, his work remained secret for many years.[94][95]/nWithin weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,[73] Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.[96]/nThe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),[97] the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.[98]/nThe bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.[99]/nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.[100]/nOn 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.[100] As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, \"This letter had an electric effect.\"[101] Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: \"ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.\" On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.[101] The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, \"All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.\"[102] More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.[103]/nTuring decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of cracking the German naval use of Enigma \"because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself\".[105] In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.[105][106]/nThat same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, \"though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken\".[105] For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.[107] Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher.[108]/nTuring travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington.[109][110] He also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.[111]/nTuring's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:/nThe American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.\nTheir test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.[112]/nDuring this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.[113] He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.[114]/nAlexander wrote of Turing's contribution:/nThere should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.[115]/nIn July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus[116]) for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.[117] He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.[118] Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,[119][120] but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.[121]/nFollowing his work at Bell Labs in the US,[122] Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park.[123][124] At the park, he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of REME officer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah.[125] The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.[126] Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war./nBetween 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton, London,[127] while he worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.[128] Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it \"contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own\".[129]/nAlthough ACE was a feasible design, the effect of the Official Secrets Act surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park made it impossible for Turing to explain the basis of his analysis of how a computer installation involving human operators would work.[130] This led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.[131] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.[132]/nAccording to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by Genscher, D\u00fcsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad Zuse.[133] It took place in G\u00f6ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz)./nIn 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. A year later, he became deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers\u2014the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.[134] During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,[135] and in \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called \"intelligent\". The idea was that a computer could be said to \"think\" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.[136] In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer./nIn 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.[137] In 1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing \"ran\" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.[138] According to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program \"played a recognizable game of chess\".[139] The program lost to Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife, Isabel.[140]/nHis Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.[141]/nWhen Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his masterpiece \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction\u2013diffusion system, could account for \"the main phenomena of morphogenesis\".[142] He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[143]/nAlthough published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology.[144] One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.[145][146][147] Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of \"feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest\".[148] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.[149] Later papers were not available until Collected Works of A.\u00a0M.\u00a0Turing was published in 1992.[150]/nA study conducted in 2023 confirmed Turing's mathematical model hypothesis. Presented by the American Physical Society, the experiment involved growing chia seeds in even layers within trays, later adjusting the available moisture. Researchers experimentally tweaked the factors which appear in the Turing equations, and, as a result, patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged. This is believed to be the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified Turing's mathematical insight.[151][152]/nIn the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order to protect it, he bought two silver bars weighing 3,200\u00a0oz (90\u00a0kg) and worth \u00a3250 (in 2022, \u00a38,000 adjusted for inflation, \u00a348,000 at spot price) and buried them in a wood near Bletchley Park.[153] Upon returning to dig them up, Turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly he had hidden them. This, along with the fact that the area had been renovated, meant that he never regained the silver.[154]/nIn 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc\u00e9e, who was reportedly \"unfazed\" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.[155]/nIn January 1952, Turing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man.[156] Just before Christmas, Turing was walking along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to lunch. On 23 January, Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,[157] and both men were charged with \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885.[158] Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor \"reserved his defence\", i.e., did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held at the Sessions House in Knutsford.[159]/nTuring was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.[160] The case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.[161] Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical changes designed to reduce libido, known as \"chemical castration\".[162] He accepted the option of injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form,[163] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that \"no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out\".[164][165] Murray was given a conditional discharge.[166]/nTuring's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic job. His trial took place only months after the defection to the Soviet Union of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean in summer 1951 after which the Foreign Office started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[167]/nTuring was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries.[168] In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[169] It was also during this time that Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and subsequently becoming a family friend.[169][170]/nOn 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow,[171] Turing's housekeeper found him dead. A post mortem was held that evening which determined that he had died the previous day at the age of 41 with Cyanide poisoning cited as the cause of death.[172][173] When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[174] it was speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose./nTuring's brother John identified the body the following day and took the advice given by Dr. Greenbaum to accept the verdict of the inquest as there was little prospect of establishing that the death was accidental.[175] The inquest was held the following day which determined the cause of death to be suicide.[162] Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium just two days later on 12 June 1954 with just three people attending[176][177] and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.[178] Turing's mother was on holiday in Italy at the time of his death and returned home after the inquest. She never accepted the verdict of suicide.[175]/nAndrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew\".[179]/nPhilosopher Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons. The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.[180] Furthermore, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) \"with good humour\" and had shown no sign of despondency before his death. He even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend.[180] Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.[181] Biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing deliberately left the nature of his death ambiguous in order to shield his mother from the knowledge that he had killed himself.[182]/nIt has been suggested that Turing's belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood.[178] As a youth, Turing had been told by a fortune-teller that he would be a genius. In mid-May 1954, shortly before his death, Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller during a day-trip to St Annes-on-Sea with the Greenbaum family.[178] According to the Greenbaums' daughter, Barbara:[170]/nBut it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went... Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a fortune-teller's tent and Alan said he'd like to go in[,] so we waited around for him to come back... And this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had happened. We don't know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide./nIn August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.[183][184] The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.[185][186] The prime minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as \"appalling\":[185][187]/nThousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him\u00a0... So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.[185][188]/nIn December 2011, William Jones and his member of Parliament, John Leech, created an e-petition[189] requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of \"gross indecency\":[190]/nWe ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of \"gross indecency\". In 1952, he was convicted of \"gross indecency\" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called \"organo-therapy\"\u2014chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save. This remains a shame on the British government and British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws.[189]/nThe petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,[189][191] and was submitted to Parliament by the Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who said:[192]/nA posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd\u2014particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.[193]/nJohn Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005\u201315), submitted several bills to Parliament[194] and led a high-profile campaign to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was \"ultimately just embarrassing\" that the conviction still stood.[195] Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years, gaining the public support of numerous leading scientists, including Stephen Hawking.[196][197] At the British premiere of a film based on Turing's life, The Imitation Game, the producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing's pardon.[198] Leech is now regularly described as the \"architect\" of Turing's pardon and subsequently the Alan Turing Law which went on to secure pardons for 75,000 other men and women convicted of similar crimes.[199][200][201][202][203][204][205]/nOn 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952.[206] Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.[207] The government indicated it would support the bill,[208][209][210] and it passed its third reading in the House of Lords in October.[211]/nAt the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[212] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[213] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for \"gross indecency\", with immediate effect.[214] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be \"remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort\" and not for his later criminal conviction.[191][215] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[216] The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[217] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.[218]/nIn September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an \"Alan Turing law\".[219][220] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales.[221]/nOn 19 July 2023, following an apology to LGBT veterans from the UK Government, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace suggested Turing should be honoured with a permanent statue on the fourth plinth of Trafalgar Square, describing Dr Turing as \"probably the greatest war hero, in my book, of the Second World War, [whose] achievements shortened the war, saved thousands of lives, helped defeat the Nazis. And his story is a sad story of a society and how it treated him.\"[222][223][224]", "52266169": "Donal O'Shea is a Canadian mathematician, who is also noted for his bestselling books.[1] He served as the fifth president of New College of Florida in Sarasota, from July 1, 2012, until June 30, 2021.

As the director of the Mittag-Leffler Institute for more than two decades, Carleman was the most influential mathematician in Sweden./nThe dissertation of Carleman under Erik Albert Holmgren, as well as his work in the early 1920s, was devoted to singular integral equations. He developed the spectral theory of integral operators with Carleman kernels, that is, kernels K(x,\u00a0y) such that K(y,\u00a0x)\u00a0=\u00a0K(x,\u00a0y) for almost every (x,\u00a0y), and/nfor almost every x.[1][2]/nIn the mid-1920s, Carleman developed the theory of quasi-analytic functions. He proved the necessary and sufficient condition for quasi-analyticity, now called the Denjoy\u2013Carleman theorem.[3] As a corollary, he obtained a sufficient condition for the determinacy of the moment problem.[4] As one of the steps in the proof of the Denjoy\u2013Carleman theorem in Carleman (1926), he introduced the Carleman inequality/nvalid for any sequence of non-negative real numbers ak.[5]/nAt about the same time, he established the Carleman formulae in complex analysis, which reconstruct an analytic function in a domain from its values on a subset of the boundary. He also proved a generalisation of Jensen's formula, now called the Jensen\u2013Carleman formula.[6]/nIn the 1930s, independently of John von Neumann, he discovered the mean ergodic theorem.[7] Later, he worked in the theory of partial differential equations, where he introduced the Carleman estimates,[8] and found a way to study the spectral asymptotics of Schr\u00f6dinger operators.[9]/nIn 1932, following the work of Henri Poincar\u00e9, Erik Ivar Fredholm, and Bernard Koopman, he devised the Carleman embedding (also called Carleman linearization), a way to embed a finite-dimensional system of nonlinear differential equations du\u2044dt\u00a0=\u00a0P(u) for u:\u00a0Rk\u00a0\u2192\u00a0R, where the components of P  are polynomials in u, into an infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations.[10][11]/nIn 1933 Carleman published a short proof of what is now called the Denjoy\u2013Carleman\u2013Ahlfors theorem.[12]\nThis theorem states that the number of asymptotic values attained by an entire function of order \u03c1 along curves in the complex plane going outwards toward infinite absolute value is less than or equal to 2\u03c1./nIn 1935, Torsten Carleman introduced a generalisation of Fourier transform, which foreshadowed the work of Mikio Sato on hyperfunctions;[13] his notes were published in Carleman (1944). He considered the functions f of at most polynomial growth, and showed that every such function can be decomposed as f\u00a0=\u00a0f+\u00a0+\u00a0f\u2212, where f+ and f\u2212 are analytic in the upper and lower half planes, respectively, and that this representation is essentially unique. Then he defined the Fourier transform of  (f+,\u00a0f\u2212) as another such pair (g+,\u00a0g\u2212). Though conceptually different, the definition coincides with the one given later by Laurent Schwartz for tempered distributions.[13] Carleman's definition gave rise to numerous extensions.[13][14]/nReturning to mathematical physics in the 1930s, Carleman gave the first proof of global existence for Boltzmann's equation in the kinetic theory of gases (his result applies to the space-homogeneous case).[15] The results were published posthumously in Carleman (1957)./nCarleman supervised the Ph.D. theses of Ulf Hellsten, Karl Persson (Dagerholm), \u00c5ke Pleijel and (jointly with Fritz Carlson) of Hans R\u00e5dstr\u00f6m./nCarleman was born in Visseltofta to Alma Linn\u00e9a Jungbeck and Karl Johan Carleman, a school teacher.[6] He studied at V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Cathedral School, graduating in 1910./nHe continued his studies at Uppsala University, being one of the active members of the Uppsala Mathematical Society.

His interaction with William Feller before the former departure to the United States was not particularly pleasant, at some point being reported due to his opinion that \"Jews and foreigners should be executed\".[20]/nCarlson remembers Carleman as: \"secluded and taciturn, who looked at life and people with a bitter humour.

He is best known for work on the Weil conjectures, leading to a complete proof in 1973. He is the winner of the 2013 Abel Prize, 2008 Wolf Prize, 1988 Crafoord Prize, and 1978 Fields Medal./nDeligne was born in Etterbeek, attended school at Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Adolphe Max and studied at the Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles (ULB), writing a dissertation titled Th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Lefschetz et crit\u00e8res de d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescence de suites spectrales (Theorem of Lefschetz and criteria of degeneration of spectral sequences). He completed his doctorate at the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay 1972 under the supervision of Alexander Grothendieck, with a thesis titled Th\u00e9orie de Hodge./nStarting in 1972, Deligne worked with Grothendieck at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques (IH\u00c9S) near Paris, initially on the generalization within scheme theory of Zariski's main theorem. In 1968, he also worked with Jean-Pierre Serre; their work led to important results on the l-adic representations attached to modular forms, and the conjectural functional equations of L-functions. Deligne's also focused on topics in Hodge theory. He introduced the concept of weights and tested them on objects in complex geometry. He also collaborated with David Mumford on a new description of the moduli spaces for curves. Their work came to be seen as an introduction to one form of the theory of algebraic stacks, and recently has been applied to questions arising from string theory.[citation needed] But Deligne's most famous contribution was his proof of the third and last of the Weil conjectures. This proof completed a programme initiated and largely developed by Alexander Grothendieck lasting for more than a decade. As a corollary he proved the celebrated Ramanujan\u2013Petersson conjecture for modular forms of weight greater than one; weight one was proved in his work with Serre.  Deligne's 1974 paper contains the first proof of the Weil conjectures. Deligne's contribution was to supply the estimate of the eigenvalues of the Frobenius endomorphism, considered the geometric analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. It also led to the proof of Lefschetz hyperplane theorem and the old and new estimates of the classical exponential sums, among other applications. Deligne's 1980 paper contains a much more general version of the Riemann hypothesis./nFrom 1970 until 1984, Deligne was a permanent member of the IH\u00c9S staff. During this time he did much important work outside of his work on algebraic geometry. In joint work with George Lusztig, Deligne applied \u00e9tale cohomology to construct representations of finite groups of Lie type; with Michael Rapoport, Deligne worked on the moduli spaces from the 'fine' arithmetic point of view, with application to modular forms. He received a Fields Medal in 1978. In 1984, Deligne moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton./nIn terms of the completion of some of the underlying Grothendieck program of research, he defined absolute Hodge cycles, as a surrogate for the missing and still largely conjectural theory of motives. This idea allows one to get around the lack of knowledge of the Hodge conjecture, for some applications. The theory of mixed Hodge structures, a powerful tool in algebraic geometry that generalizes classical Hodge theory, was created by applying weight filtration, Hironaka's resolution of singularities and other methods, which he then used to prove the Weil conjectures. He reworked the Tannakian category theory in his 1990 paper for the \"Grothendieck Festschrift\", employing Beck's theorem \u2013 the Tannakian category concept being the categorical expression of the linearity of the theory of motives as the ultimate Weil cohomology. All this is part of the yoga of weights, uniting Hodge theory and the l-adic Galois representations. The Shimura variety theory is related, by the idea that such varieties should parametrize not just good (arithmetically interesting) families of Hodge structures, but actual motives. This theory is not yet a finished product, and more recent trends have used K-theory approaches./nWith Alexander Beilinson, Joseph Bernstein, and Ofer Gabber, Deligne made definitive contributions to the theory of perverse sheaves.[1] This theory plays an important role in the recent proof of the fundamental lemma by Ng\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u. It was also used by Deligne himself to greatly clarify the nature of the Riemann\u2013Hilbert correspondence, which extends Hilbert's twenty-first problem to higher dimensions. Prior to Deligne's paper, Zoghman Mebkhout's 1980 thesis and the work of Masaki Kashiwara through D-modules theory (but published in the 80s) on the problem have appeared./nIn 1974 at the IH\u00c9S, Deligne's joint paper with Phillip Griffiths, John Morgan and Dennis Sullivan on the real homotopy theory of compact K\u00e4hler manifolds was a major piece of work in complex differential geometry which settled several important questions of both classical and modern significance. The input from Weil conjectures, Hodge theory, variations of Hodge structures, and many geometric and topological tools were critical to its investigations. His work in complex singularity theory generalized Milnor maps into an algebraic setting and extended the Picard-Lefschetz formula beyond their general format, generating a new method of research in this subject. His paper with Ken Ribet on abelian L-functions and their extensions to Hilbert modular surfaces and p-adic L-functions form an important part of his work in arithmetic geometry. Other important research achievements of Deligne include the notion of cohomological descent, motivic L-functions, mixed sheaves, nearby vanishing cycles, central extensions of reductive groups, geometry and topology of braid groups, the work in collaboration with George Mostow on the examples of non-arithmetic lattices and monodromy of hypergeometric differential equations in two- and three-dimensional complex hyperbolic spaces, etc./nHe was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978, the Crafoord Prize in 1988, the Balzan Prize in 2004, the Wolf Prize in 2008, and the Abel Prize in 2013, \"for seminal contributions to algebraic geometry and for their transformative impact \non number theory, representation theory, and related fields\".

At Harvard, he became a Putnam Fellow in 1955 and 1956.[5] He completed his PhD in 1961, with a thesis entitled Existence of the moduli scheme for curves of any genus. He married Erika, an author and poet, in 1959 and they had four children, Stephen, Peter, Jeremy, and Suchitra. He currently has seven grandchildren./nMumford's work in geometry combined traditional geometric insights with the latest algebraic techniques. He published on moduli spaces, with a theory summed up in his book Geometric Invariant Theory, on the equations defining an abelian variety, and on algebraic surfaces./nHis books Abelian Varieties (with C. P. Ramanujam) and Curves on an Algebraic Surface combined the old and new theories. His lecture notes on scheme theory circulated for years in unpublished form, at a time when they were, beside the treatise \u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique, the only accessible introduction. They are now available as The Red Book of Varieties and Schemes (ISBN\u00a03-540-63293-X)./nOther work that was less thoroughly written up were lectures on varieties defined by quadrics, and a study of Goro Shimura's papers from the 1960s./nMumford's research did much to revive the classical theory of theta functions, by showing that its algebraic content was large, and enough to support the main parts of the theory by reference to finite analogues of the Heisenberg group. This work on the equations defining abelian varieties appeared in 1966\u20137. He published some further books of lectures on the theory./nHe also was one of the founders of the toroidal embedding theory; and sought to apply the theory to Gr\u00f6bner basis techniques, through students who worked in algebraic computation./nIn a sequence of four papers published in the American Journal of Mathematics between 1961 and 1975, Mumford explored pathological behavior in algebraic geometry, that is, phenomena that would not arise if the world of algebraic geometry were as well-behaved as one might expect from looking at the simplest examples.  These pathologies fall into two types: (a) bad behavior in characteristic p and (b) bad behavior in moduli spaces./nMumford's philosophy in characteristic p was as follows:/nA nonsingular characteristic p variety is analogous to a general non-K\u00e4hler complex manifold;  in particular, a projective embedding of such a variety is not as strong as a K\u00e4hler metric on a complex manifold, and the Hodge\u2013Lefschetz\u2013Dolbeault theorems on sheaf cohomology break down in every possible way./nIn the first Pathologies paper, Mumford finds an everywhere regular differential form on a smooth projective surface that is not closed, and shows that Hodge symmetry fails for classical Enriques surfaces in characteristic two.  This second example is developed further in Mumford's third paper on classification of surfaces in characteristic p (written in collaboration with E. Bombieri).  This pathology can now be explained in terms of the Picard scheme of the surface, and in particular, its failure to be a reduced scheme, which is a theme developed in Mumford's book \"Lectures on Curves on an Algebraic Surface\".  Worse pathologies related to p-torsion in crystalline cohomology were explored by Luc Illusie (Ann. Sci. Ec. Norm. Sup. (4) 12 (1979), 501\u2013661)./nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford gives a simple example of a surface in characteristic p where the geometric genus is non-zero, but the second Betti number is equal to the rank of the N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group. Further such examples arise in Zariski surface theory.  He also conjectures that the Kodaira vanishing theorem is false for surfaces in characteristic p.  In the third paper, he gives an example of a normal surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails.  The first example of a smooth surface for which Kodaira vanishing fails was given by Michel Raynaud in 1978./nIn the second Pathologies paper, Mumford finds that the Hilbert scheme parametrizing space curves of degree 14 and genus 24 has a multiple component.  In the fourth Pathologies paper, he finds reduced and irreducible complete curves which are not specializations of non-singular curves./nThese sorts of pathologies were considered to be fairly scarce when they first appeared.  But Ravi Vakil showed in his paper \"Murphy's law in algebraic geometry\" has shown that Hilbert schemes of nice geometric objects can be arbitrarily \"bad\", with unlimited numbers of components and with arbitrarily large multiplicities (Invent. Math. 164 (2006), 569\u2013590)./nIn three papers written between 1969 and 1976 (the last two in collaboration with Enrico Bombieri), Mumford extended the Enriques\u2013Kodaira classification of smooth projective surfaces from the case of the complex ground field to the case of an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic p.  The final answer turns out to be essentially the same as the answer in the complex case (though the methods employed are sometimes quite different), once two important adjustments are made.  The first is that one may get \"non-classical\" surfaces, which come about when p-torsion in the Picard scheme degenerates to a non-reduced group scheme.  The second is the possibility of obtaining quasi-elliptic surfaces in characteristics two and three.  These are surfaces fibred over a curve where the general fibre is a curve of arithmetic genus one with a cusp./nOnce these adjustments are made, the surfaces are divided into four classes by their Kodaira dimension, as in the complex case.  The four classes are:\na) Kodaira dimension minus infinity.  These are the ruled surfaces.\nb) Kodaira dimension 0.  These are the K3 surfaces, abelian surfaces, hyperelliptic and quasi-hyperelliptic surfaces, and Enriques surfaces.  There are classical and non-classical examples in the last two Kodaira dimension zero cases.\nc) Kodaira dimension 1. These are the elliptic and quasi-elliptic surfaces not contained in the last two groups.\nd) Kodaira dimension 2. These are the surfaces of general type./nMumford was awarded a Fields Medal in 1974.

Both Prince Matila and Princess Eileen are buried in Gunnersbury Cemetery, London.[7]  Their funeral monument was restored in 2010 by art historian Dr Radu Varia.[8]/nIn around 1900, Ghyka spent a year studying engineering at the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de Paris, Whilst there he developed his own mathematical ideas on the relationship between thermodynamics and living matter, partly under the influence of Gustave Le Bon.[6] He returned to mathematics around 1920 when Albert Einstein's theories were published, and over the next few years developed ideas on the mathematics of form which he published in 1927 as Esth\u00e9tique des proportions dans la nature et dans les arts, and revised and expanded in his two volume Le nombre d'or. Rites et rythmes pythagoriciens dans le development de la civilisation occidentale in 1931. Ghyka developed a personal philosophy in which all living things were endowed with an energy and functioned with a rhythm related to that of the golden ratio.[9] Further work was published in French as Essai sur le rythme (1938), Tour d'horizon philosophique (1946) and Philosophie et Mystique du nombre (1952), and in English as The Geometry of Art and Life (1946). Around 1945 Ghyka was offered a visiting Professorship at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles because the President of the University had read Esth\u00e9tique des proportions, and this was followed in 1947 by a job in the Art Department of Mary Washington College, where he taught his personal aesthetic theories for three years. In 1950 he returned to his wife at their family home in Dublin and his  Practical Handbook of Geometry and Design  was published in 1952./nSalvador Dal\u00ed possessed two copy of Ghyka's books which was read by theatre director Peter Brook, who was profoundly influenced by Ghyka's ideas on the mathematical relationships between classical art and the human body.[10]\nThe only monograph on his life and work appeared in Romanian.[11]/nGhyka has been the subject of recent publications in German and Romanian.[12][13][14][15][1][9]", "787827": "Klaus Friedrich Roth FRS (29 October 1925 \u2013 10 November 2015) was a German-born British mathematician who won the Fields Medal for proving Roth's theorem on the Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers. He was also a winner of the De Morgan Medal and the Sylvester Medal, and a Fellow of the Royal Society./nRoth moved to England as a child in 1933 to escape the Nazis, and was educated at the University of Cambridge and University College London, finishing his doctorate in 1950. He taught at University College London until 1966, when he took a chair at Imperial College London. He retired in 1988./nBeyond his work on Diophantine approximation, Roth made major contributions to the theory of progression-free sets in arithmetic combinatorics and to the theory of irregularities of distribution. He was also known for his research on sums of powers, on the large sieve, on the Heilbronn triangle problem, and on square packing in a square. He was a coauthor of the book Sequences on integer sequences./nRoth was born to a Jewish family in Breslau, Prussia, on 29 October 1925. His parents settled with him in London to escape Nazi persecution in 1933, and he was raised and educated in the UK.[1][2] His father, a solicitor, had been exposed to poison gas during World War I and died while Roth was still young. Roth became a pupil at St Paul's School, London from 1939 to 1943, and with the rest of the school he was evacuated from London to Easthampstead Park during the Blitz. At school, he was known for his ability in both chess and mathematics. He tried to join the Air Training Corps, but was blocked for some years for being German and then after that for lacking the coordination needed for a pilot.[2]/nRoth read mathematics at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and played first board for the Cambridge chess team,[2] finishing in 1945.[3]\nDespite his skill in mathematics, he achieved only third-class honours on the Mathematical Tripos, because of his poor test-taking ability. His Cambridge tutor, John Charles Burkill, was not supportive of Roth continuing in mathematics, recommending instead that he take \"some commercial job with a statistical bias\".[2]\nInstead, he briefly became a schoolteacher at Gordonstoun, between finishing at Cambridge and beginning his graduate studies.[1][2]/nOn the recommendation of Harold Davenport, he was accepted in 1946 to a master's program in mathematics at University College London, where he worked under the supervision of Theodor Estermann.[2] He completed a master's degree there in 1948, and a doctorate in 1950.[3] His dissertation was Proof that almost all Positive Integers are Sums of a Square, a Positive Cube and a Fourth Power.[4]/nOn receiving his master's degree in 1948, Roth became an assistant lecturer at University College London, and in 1950 he was promoted to lecturer.[5]\nHis most significant contributions, on Diophantine approximation, progression-free sequences, and discrepancy, were all published in the mid-1950s,\nand by 1958 he was given the Fields Medal, mathematicians' highest honour.[2][6] However, it was not until 1961 that he was promoted to full professor.[1]\nDuring this period, he continued to work closely with Harold Davenport.[2]/nHe took sabbaticals at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, and seriously considered migrating to the United States. Walter Hayman and Patrick Linstead countered this possibility, which they saw as a threat to British mathematics, with an offer of a chair in pure mathematics at Imperial College London, and Roth accepted the chair in 1966.[2] He retained this position until official retirement in 1988.[1] He remained at Imperial College as Visiting Professor until 1996.[3]/nRoth's lectures were usually very clear but could occasionally be erratic.[2]\nThe Mathematics Genealogy Project lists him as having only two doctoral students,[4] but one of them, William Chen, who continued Roth's work in discrepancy theory, became a Fellow of the Australian Mathematical Society and head of the mathematics department at Macquarie University.[7]/nIn 1955, Roth married M\u00e9l\u00e8k Kha\u00efry, who had attracted his attention when she was a student in his first lecture; Kha\u00efry was a daughter of Egyptian senator Kha\u00efry Pacha[1][2] She came to work for the psychology department at University College London, where she published research on the effects of toxins on rats.[8]\nOn Roth's retirement, they moved to Inverness; Roth dedicated a room of their house to Latin dancing, a shared interest of theirs.[2][9]\nKha\u00efry died in 2002, and Roth died in Inverness on 10 November 2015 at the age of 90.[1][2][3]\nThey had no children, and Roth dedicated the bulk of his estate, over one million pounds, to two health charities \"to help elderly and infirm people living in the city of Inverness\". He sent the Fields Medal with a smaller bequest to Peterhouse.[10]/nRoth was known as a problem-solver in mathematics, rather than as a theory-builder. Harold Davenport writes that the \"moral in Dr Roth's work\" is that \"the great unsolved problems of mathematics may still yield to direct attack, however difficult and forbidding they appear to be, and however much effort has already been spent on them\".[6] His research interests spanned several topics in number theory, discrepancy theory, and the theory of integer sequences./nThe subject of Diophantine approximation seeks accurate approximations of irrational numbers by rational numbers. The question of how accurately algebraic numbers could be approximated became known as the Thue\u2013Siegel problem, after previous progress on this question by Axel Thue and Carl Ludwig Siegel. The accuracy of approximation can be measured by the approximation exponent of a number \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n, defined as the largest number \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n such that \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n has infinitely many rational approximations \n\n\n\np\n\n/\n\nq\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p/q}\n\n with \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nx\n\u2212\np\n\n/\n\nq\n\n|\n\n<\n1\n\n/\n\n\nq\n\ne\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |x-p/q|<1/q^{e}}\n\n. If the approximation exponent is large, then \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n has more accurate approximations than a number whose exponent is smaller. The smallest possible approximation exponent is two: even the hardest-to-approximate numbers can be approximated with exponent two using continued fractions.[3][6] Before Roth's work, it was believed that the algebraic numbers could have a larger approximation exponent, related to the degree of the polynomial defining the number.[2]/nIn 1955, Roth published what is now known as Roth's theorem, completely settling this question. His theorem falsified the supposed connection between approximation exponent and degree, and proved that, in terms of the approximation exponent, the algebraic numbers are the least accurately approximated of any irrational numbers. More precisely, he proved that for irrational algebraic numbers, the approximation exponent is always exactly two.[3] In a survey of Roth's work presented by Harold Davenport to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1958, when Roth was given the Fields Medal, Davenport called this result Roth's \"greatest achievement\".[6]/nAnother result called \"Roth's theorem\", from 1953, is in arithmetic combinatorics and concerns sequences of integers with no three in arithmetic progression. These sequences had been studied in 1936 by Paul Erd\u0151s and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n, who conjectured that they must be sparse.[11][a]\nHowever, in 1942, Rapha\u00ebl Salem and Donald C. Spencer constructed progression-free subsets of the numbers from \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 1}\n\n to \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n of size proportional to \n\n\n\n\nn\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b5\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n^{1-\\varepsilon }}\n\n, for every \n\n\n\n\u03b5\n>\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon >0}\n\n.[12]/nRoth vindicated Erd\u0151s and Tur\u00e1n by proving that it is not possible for the size of such a set to be proportional to \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n: every dense set of integers contains a three-term arithmetic progression. His proof uses techniques from analytic number theory including the Hardy\u2013Littlewood circle method to estimate the number of progressions in a given sequence and show that, when the sequence is dense enough, this number is nonzero.[2][13]/nOther authors later strengthened Roth's bound on the size of progression-free sets.[14] A strengthening in a different direction, Szemer\u00e9di's theorem, shows that dense sets of integers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.[15]/nAlthough Roth's work on Diophantine approximation led to the highest recognition for him, it is his research on irregularities of distribution that (according to an obituary by William Chen and Bob Vaughan) he was most proud of.[2] His 1954 paper on this topic laid the foundations for modern discrepancy theory. It concerns the placement of \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n points in a unit square so that, for every rectangle bounded between the origin and a point of the square, the area of the rectangle is well-approximated by the number of points in it.[2]/nRoth measured this approximation by the squared difference between the number of points and \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n times the area, and proved that for a randomly chosen rectangle the expected value of the squared difference is logarithmic in \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n. This result is best possible, and significantly improved a previous bound on the same problem by Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest.[16] Despite the prior work of Ehrenfest and Johannes van der Corput on the same problem, Roth was known for boasting that this result \"started a subject\".[2]/nSome of Roth's earliest works included a 1949 paper on sums of powers, showing that almost all positive integers could be represented as a sum of a square, a cube, and a fourth power, and a 1951 paper on the gaps between squarefree numbers, describes as \"quite sensational\" and  \"of considerable importance\" respectively by Chen and Vaughan.[2] His inaugural lecture at Imperial College concerned the large sieve: bounding the size of sets of integers from which many congruence classes of numbers modulo prime numbers have been forbidden.[17] Roth had previously published a paper on this problem in 1965./nAnother of Roth's interests was the Heilbronn triangle problem, of placing points in a square to avoid triangles of small area. His 1951 paper on the problem was the first to prove a nontrivial upper bound on the area that can be achieved. He eventually published four papers on this problem, the latest in 1976.[18]\nRoth also made significant progress on square packing in a square. If unit squares are packed into an \n\n\n\ns\n\u00d7\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s\\times s}\n\n square in the obvious, axis-parallel way, then for values of \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n that are just below an integer, nearly \n\n\n\n2\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2s}\n\n area can be left uncovered. After Paul Erd\u0151s and Ronald Graham proved that a more clever tilted packing could leave a significantly smaller area, only \n\n\n\nO\n(\n\ns\n\n7\n\n/\n\n11\n\n\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle O(s^{7/11})}\n\n,[19] Roth and Bob Vaughan responded with a 1978 paper proving the first nontrivial lower bound on the problem. As they showed, for some values of \n\n\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s}\n\n, the uncovered area must be at least proportional to \n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {s}}}\n\n.[2][20]/nIn 1966, Heini Halberstam and Roth published their book Sequences, on integer sequences. Initially planned to be the first of a two-volume set, its topics included the densities of sums of sequences, bounds on the number of representations of integers as sums of members of sequences, density of sequences whose sums represent all integers, sieve theory and the probabilistic method, and sequences in which no element is a multiple of another.[21] A second edition was published in 1983.[22]/nRoth won the Fields Medal in 1958 for his work on Diophantine approximation. He was the first British Fields medalist.[1] He was elected to the Royal Society in 1960, and later became an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Fellow of University College London, Fellow of Imperial College London, and Honorary Fellow of Peterhouse.[1] It was a source of amusement to him that his Fields Medal, election to the Royal Society, and professorial chair came to him in the reverse order of their prestige.[2]/nThe London Mathematical Society gave Roth the De Morgan Medal in 1983.[3]\nIn 1991, the Royal Society gave him their Sylvester Medal \"for his many contributions to number theory and in particular his solution of the famous problem concerning approximating algebraic numbers by rationals.\"[23]/nA festschrift of 32 essays on topics related to Roth's research was published in 2009, in honour of Roth's 80th birthday,[24]\nand in 2017 the editors of the journal Mathematika dedicated a special issue to Roth.[25]\nAfter Roth's death, the Imperial College Department of Mathematics instituted the Roth Scholarship in his honour.[26]", "54429046": "Jean Dubreuil, also known as Jean Du Breuil (22 July 1602 \u2013 27 April 1670), was a French mathematician, music theorist, writer and essayist.[1]/nSon of the bookseller Claude Du Breuil, he continued his father's profession until he joined the Society of Jesus.

He is often regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.[2] Comte's ideas were also fundamental to the development of sociology; indeed, he invented the term and treated that discipline as the crowning achievement of the sciences.[3]/nInfluenced by Henri de Saint-Simon,[1] Comte's work attempted to remedy the social disorder caused by the French Revolution, which he believed indicated imminent transition to a new form of society. He sought to establish a new social doctrine based on science, which he labelled positivism. He had a major impact on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as John Stuart Mill and George Eliot.[4] His concept of Sociologie and social evolutionism set the tone for early social theorists and anthropologists such as Harriet Martineau and Herbert Spencer, evolving into modern academic sociology presented by \u00c9mile Durkheim as practical and objective social research./nComte's social theories culminated in his \"Religion of Humanity\",[1] which presaged the development of non-theistic religious humanist and secular humanist organisations in the 19th century. He may also have coined the word altruisme (altruism).[5]/nAuguste Comte was born in Montpellier,[1] H\u00e9rault on 19 January 1798, at the time under the rule of the newly founded French First Republic. After attending the Lyc\u00e9e Joffre[6] and then the University of Montpellier, Comte was admitted to \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris. The \u00c9cole Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of republicanism and progress. The \u00c9cole closed in 1816 for reorganization, however, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the \u00c9cole Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission./nFollowing his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his Catholic and monarchist family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. Comte had abandoned Catholicism under the influence of his first teacher and protestant pastor Daniel Encontre.[7][8]/nIn August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 Rue Bonaparte in Paris's 6th arrondissement (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to Henri de Saint-Simon, who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time, Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, L'Industrie, Le Politique, and L'Organisateur (Charles Dunoyer and Charles Comte's Le Censeur Europ\u00e9en), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819's \"La s\u00e9paration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale entre les opinions et les d\u00e9sirs\" (\"The general separation of opinions and desires\")./nIn 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a Plan de travaux scientifiques n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9organiser la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (1822) (Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.[9]/nComte married Caroline Massin in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured \u2013 only stabilized by French alienist Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol \u2013 so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the Pont des Arts). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his Cours./nComte developed a close friendship with John Stuart Mill. From 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic Clotilde de Vaux, although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new \"Religion of Humanity\". John Kells Ingram, an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855./nHe published four volumes of Syst\u00e8me de politique positive (1851\u20131854). His final work, the first volume of La Synth\u00e8se Subjective (\"The Subjective Synthesis\"), was published in 1856. Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery, surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux.\nHis apartment from 1841 to 1857 is now conserved as the Maison d'Auguste Comte and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in Paris' 6th arrondissement./nComte first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in The Course in Positive Philosophy, a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, A General View of Positivism (published in English in 1865). The first 3 volumes of the Course dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence (mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of social science. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term.[10] Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex \"Queen science\" of human society itself. His work View of Positivism would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of the sociological method.[citation needed]/nComte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general law of three stages./nComte's stages were (1) the theological stage, (2) the metaphysical stage, and (3) the positive stage.[11]/nComte's law of three stages was one of the first theories of social evolutionism./nHe once wrote: 'It is evident, the Solar System is badly designed'/nThe other universal law he called the \"encyclopedic law\". By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics (astronomy, earth science and chemistry) and organic physics (biology and, for the first time, physique sociale, later renamed Sociologie). Independently from Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s's introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented \"sociologie\", and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term \"social physics\", but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by Adolphe Quetelet./nThe most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand \u2013 not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of anyone...This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called \"positivity\", which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these, he gave the names: astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology./nThis idea of a special science (not the humanities, not metaphysics) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term \"sociology\" (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s (1748\u20131836).[12] The ambitious (or many would say 'grandiose') ways that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered \"Anthropology, or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science.\"[13]/nComte's explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice, and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of Harriet Martineau's translation of The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte, we see his observation that, \"If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part, we could not even perceive them.\"[15]/nComte's emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern functionalism. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte's time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition./nHis emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative statistical analysis, and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of Total Quality Management (TQM) and Continuous Quality Improvement where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA, the Shewhart cycle). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena./nThe early sociology of Herbert Spencer came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as socially Darwinistic terms./nComte's fame today owes in part to \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9, who founded The Positivist Review in 1867./nAuguste Comte did not create the idea of Sociology, the study of society, patterns of social relationships, social interaction, and culture, but instead, he expanded it greatly. Positivism, the principle of conducting sociology through empiricism and the scientific method, was the primary way that Comte studied sociology. He split sociology into two different areas of study. One, social statics, how society holds itself together, and two, social dynamics, the study of the causes of societal changes. He saw these areas as parts of the same system. Comte compared society and sociology to the human body and anatomy. \"Comte ascribed the functions of connection and boundaries to the social structures of language, religion, and division of labor.\"[citation needed] Through language, everybody in society, both past, and present, can communicate with each other. Religion unites society under a common belief system and functions in harmony under a system. Finally, the division of labor allows everyone in society to depend upon each other./nComte is often disregarded when talking about utopia. However, he made many contributions to utopian literature and influenced the modern-day debate. Some intellectuals allude to the fact that the utopian system of modern life \"served as a catalyst for various world-making activities during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\" (Willson, M. 2019)[further explanation needed]. In this utopian project, Comte introduces three major concepts: altruism, sociocracy, and the religion of Humanity. In the 19th century, Comte coined altruism as \"a theory of conduct that regards the good of others as the end of moral action.\u201d (Britannica, T, 2013). Furthermore, Comte explains sociocracy as the governance by people who know each other, friends, or allies. After the French revolution, Comte was looking for a rational basis for government, after developing the Positivism philosophy he developed sociocracy to the \u201cscientific method\u201d of the government./nIn later years, Comte developed the Religion of Humanity for positivist societies to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the 'positivist calendar'. For close associate John Stuart Mill, it was possible to distinguish between a \"good Comte\" (the author of the Course in Positive Philosophy) and a \"bad Comte\" (the author of the secular-religious system).[10] The system was unsuccessful but met with the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859) to influence the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte's English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to \"vivre pour autrui\" (\"live for others\"), from which comes the word \"altruism\".[16]/nComte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how the history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind.[17]/nThe law is this: that each of our leading conceptions\u00a0\u2013 each branch of our knowledge\u00a0\u2013 passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the Theological, or fictitious; the Metaphysical, or abstract; and the Scientific, or positive./nThe Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system \"has lost its power\" and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. (Lenzer 1975, pg 10)[19] The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an \"organic\" new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment in society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there need to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a \"series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters\".[19] The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.\nThe Law of Three Stages is split into stages, much like how the human mind changes from stage to stage. The three stages are the theological stage, the metaphysical stage, and the positive stage, also known as the Law of Three Stages. The theological stage happened before the 1300s, in which all societies lived a life that was completely theocentric. The metaphysical stage was when the society seeks universal rights and freedom. With the third and final stage, the positive stage, Comte takes a stand on the question, \u201chow should the relations among philosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be seen.\"[20] He says that sociology and history are not mutually exclusive, but that history is the method of sociology, thus he calls sociology the \u201cfinal science.\u201d  This positive stage was to solve social problems and forcing these social problems to be fixed without care for \u201cthe will of God\u201d or \u201chuman rights.\u201d Comte finds that these stages can be seen across different societies across all of history./nThe first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because \"the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents\".[21] The Theological Stage is the \"necessary starting point of human intelligence\" when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena.[22] In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved of this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena were caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon's philosophy that \"there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts\", but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories.[22] \"For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other\".[22] Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been \"incapable of remembering facts\", and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life.[22] Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary at the beginning of the developing primitive mind./nThe first theological state is the necessary starting point of human intelligence. The human mind primarily focuses its attention on the \"inner nature of beings and to the first and final causes of all phenomena it observes.\" (Ferre 2) This means that the mind is looking for the cause and effect of an action that will govern the social world. Therefore, it \"represents these phenomena as being produced by a direct and continuous action of more or less numerous supernatural agents, whose arbitrary interventions explain all the apparent anomalies of the universe.\" (Ferre 2) This primary subset of the theological state is known as fetishism, where the phenomena must be caused and created by a theological supernatural being such as God, making humans view every event in the universe as a direct will from these supernatural agents. Some people believed in souls or spirits that possessed inanimate objects and practiced Animism. These natural spiritual beings who possessed souls and may exist apart from the material bodies were capable of interacting with humans, therefore requiring sacrifices and worship to please the agents. With all these new reasons behind phenomena, numerous fetishisms occur, needing several gods to continue to explain events. \nPeople begin to believe that every object or event has a unique god attached to it. This belief is called polytheism. The mind \"substituted the providential action of a single being for the varied play of numerous independent gods which have been imagined by the primitive mind.\" These Gods often took on both human and animal resemblance. In Egypt, there were multiple gods with animal body parts such as Ra, who had the head of a hawk and had sun associations with the Egyptians. The polytheistic Greeks had several gods such as Poseidon who controlled the sea and Demeter who was the goddess of fertility. However, with all these new gods governing the phenomena of society, the brain can get confused with the numerous gods it needs to remember. The human mind eliminates this problem by believing in a sub-stage called monotheism. Rather than having multiple gods, there is simply one all-knowing and omnipotent God who is the center of power controlling the world. This creates harmony with the universe because everything is under one ruler. This leaves no confusion of how to act or who is the superior ruler out of the several gods seen in polytheism. The theological state functions well as the first state of the mind when making a belief about an event because it creates a temporary placeholder for the cause of the action which can later be replaced. By allowing the brain to think of the reason behind phenomena, the polytheistic gods are fillers that can be replaced by monotheistic gods. The theological stage shows how the primitive mind views supernatural phenomena and how it defines and sorts the causes. \"The earliest progress of the human mind could only have been produced by the theological method, the only method which can develop spontaneously. It alone has the important property of offering us a provisional theory,\u2026 which immediately groups the first facts, with its help, by cultivating our capacity for observation, we were able to prepare the age of a wholly positive philosophy.\" (Comte 149)/nComte believed the theological stage was necessary because of the foundational belief that man's earliest philosophy of explanation is the act of connecting phenomena around him to his own actions; that man may \"apply the study of external nature to his own\".[23] This first stage is necessary to remove mankind from the \"vicious circle in which it was confined by the two necessities of observing first, in order to form conceptions, and of forming theories first, in order to observe\".[23] Additionally, the theological stage is able to organize society by directing \"the first social organization, as it first forms a system of common opinions, and by forming such a system\".[23] Though, according to Comte, it could not last, this stage was able to establish an intellectual unity that made an impressive political system. The theological state was also necessary for human progress on account that it creates a class in a society dedicated to \"speculative activity\".[23] It is in this way that Comte sees the theological stage continue to exist into the Enlightenment. Comte momentarily admires the theological stage for its remarkable ability to enact this activity amidst a time when it was argued to be impractical. It is to this stage that the human mind owes \"the first effectual separation between theory and practice, which could take place in no other manner\" other than through the institution provided by the theological stage.[23]/nThe Theological Stage is the stage that was seen primarily among the civilizations in the distant past. Having been used before the 1300s, this is a very basic view of the world with little to no involvement in the world of science, and a world of illusions and delusions, as Freud would put it. To seek the nature of all beings, mankind puts its focus on sentiments, feelings, and emotions. This turned mankind towards theology and the creation of gods to answer all their questions./nThe Theological Stage is broken into three sections:/nThe second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an \"abstract entity\";[21] it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own./nThe metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because \"Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible\", and their \"conceptions are so radically opposed in character\", human intelligence must have a gradual transition.[22] Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity.[17] The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through \"over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question\".[19] The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage./nIn understanding Comte\u2019s argument, it is important to note that Comte explains the theological and positive stages first and only then returns to explain the metaphysical stage. His rationale in this decision is that \u201cany intermediate state can be judged only after a precise analysis of two extremes\u201d.[23] Only upon arrival to the rational positive state can the metaphysical state be analyzed, serving only a purpose of aiding in the transition from the theological to a positive state. Furthermore, this state \u201creconciles, for a time, the radical opposition of the other two, adapting itself to the gradual decline of the one and the preparatory rise of the other\u201d.[23] Therefore, the transition between the two states is almost unperceivable. Unlike its predecessor and successor, the metaphysical state does not have a strong intellectual foundation nor social power for a political organization. Rather it simply serves to guide man until the transition from imaginative theological state to rational positive state is complete./nThe last stage \u2013 the positive stage \u2013 is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world.[25] This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was \"the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge\"[21] because it organized all of human behavior./nThe final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena.[19] Humans realize that laws exist and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation. Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage.[25] He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the \"science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes\", is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe.[19] Astronomy is the most simple science and is the first \"to be subjected to positive theories\".[22] Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the \"general laws of the inorganic world\", and are harder to distinguish.[19] Physiology completes the system of natural sciences and is the most important of all sciences because it is the \"only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves\".[22] This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace./nIt is through observation that humanity is able to gather knowledge. The only way within society to gather evidence and build upon what we do not already know to strengthen society is to observe and experience our situational surroundings. \u201cIn the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of phenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them; likewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones,\u201d [26] The imperfection of humanity is not a result of the way we think, rather our perspective that guides the way we think. Comte expresses the idea that we have to open our eyes to different ideas and ways to evaluate our surroundings such as focusing outside of the simple facts and abstract ideas but instead dive into the supernatural. This does not make mean that what is around us is not critical to look out for as our observations are critical assets to our thinking. The things that are \"lost\" or knowledge that is in the past are still relevant to recent knowledge. It is what is before our time that guides why things are the way they are today. We would always be relying on our own facts and would never hypothesize to reveal the supernatural if we do not observe. Observing strives to further our thinking processes. According to Comte, \"\u2018The dead govern the living,\u2019 which is likely a reference to the cumulative nature of positivism and the fact that our current world is shaped by the actions and discoveries of those who came before us,\"[citation needed] As this is true, the observations only relevant to humanity and not abstractly related to humanity are distinct and seen situationally. The situation leads to human observation as a reflection of the tension in society can be reviewed, overall helping to enhance knowledge development. \nUpon our observation skills, our thinking shifts. As thinkers and observers, we switch from trying to identify truth and turn toward the rationality and reason nature brings, giving us the ability to observe. This distinct switch takes on the transition from the abstract to the supernatural. \"Comte\u2019s classification of the sciences was based upon the hypothesis that the sciences had developed from the understanding of simple and abstract principles to the understanding of complex and concrete phenomena.\"[27] Instead of taking what we believe to be true we turn it around to use the phenomena of science and the observation of natural law to justify what we believe to be true within society. \nThe condensing and formulation of human knowledge is what Comte drives us toward to ultimately build the strongest society possible. If scientists do not take the chance to research why a certain animal species are going distinct and their facts researched by those in the past are no longer true of the present, how is the data supposed to grow? How are we to gain more knowledge? These facts of life are valuable, but it is beyond these facts that Comte gestures us to look to. Instead of the culmination of facts with little sufficiency, knowledge altogether takes on its role in the realm of science. In connection to science, Comte relates to science in two specific fields to rebuild the construction of human knowledge. As science is broad, Comte reveals this scientific classification for the sake of thinking and the future organization of society. \"Comte divided sociology into two main fields, or branches: social statistics, or the study of the forces that hold society together; and social dynamics, or the study of the causes of social change,\u201d [27] In doing this, society is reconstructed. By reconstructing human thinking and observation, societal operation alters. The attention is drawn to science, hypothesis\u2019, natural law, and supernatural ideas, allows sociology to be divided into these two categories. By combining the simple facts from the abstract to the supernatural and switching our thinking towards hypothetical observation, the sciences culminate in order to formulate sociology and this new societal division. \u201cEvery social system\u2026 aims definitively at directing all special forces towards a general result, for the exercise of a general and combined activity is the essence of the society,\u201d [28] Social phenomena Comte believed can be transferred into laws and that systemization could become the prime guide to sociology so that all can maintain knowledge to continue building a strong intellectual society./nTo continue building a strong intellectual society, Comte believed the building or reformation requires intricate steps to achieve success. First, the new society must be created after the old society is destroyed because \"without\u2026destruction no adequate conception could be formed of what must be done,\".[29] Essentially a new society cannot be formed if it is constantly hindered by the ghost of its past. On the same terms, there will be no room for progress if the new society continues to compare itself to the old society. If humanity does not destroy the old society, the old society will destroy humanity./nOr on the other hand, if one destroys the old society, \"without ever replacing it, the people march onwards towards total anarchy,\".[29] \u00a0If the society is continuously chipped away without being replaced with new ideal societal structures, then society will fall deeper back into its old faults. The burdens will grow deep and entangle the platforms for the new society, thus prohibiting progress, and ultimately fulfilling the cursed seesaw of remodeling and destroying society. Hence, according to Comte, to design a successful new society, one must keep the balance of reconstruction and deconstruction. This balance allows for progress to continue without fault./nAuguste Comte is well known for writing in his book The Positive Philosophy that people would never learn the chemical composition of the stars. This has been called a very poor prediction regarding human limits in science.  In thirty years people were beginning to learn the composition of stars through spectroscopy.[30][31]/nBeyond Comte\u2019s substantive theoretical corpus, a less well-known yet interesting aspect of his work is his reflections upon the relation between self and knowledge production. Comte was troubled by the problem of how an individual that is the product of actually existing society could produce science aimed at transforming said society, and speaks in Positive Polity[32] of a process of self-transformation aimed at improving himself as a knowledge producer. As the methodologist Audrey Alejandro has elaborated,[33] these considerations by Comte foreshadow key concerns in contemporary social science regarding the importance of reflexivity, meaning by this the necessity to be critically aware and to assess the ways personal dispositions and unconscious discourses shape the production of knowledge.[34] Moving forward, Alejandro has seen in Comte a foundation to develop a reflexive discourse analysis (RDA) framework, so as to provide social scientists with applicable tools from discourse analysis for the task of implementing reflexivity in practice.[33]", "65865082": "Adelaide Smith (born 1870 in Boone, Iowa) was an American mathematician who studied with David Hilbert at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, traveled to South Africa to teach at the only women's college south of the equator, and wrote two books about her experiences there.

Jack Hibbert had the difficult job of creating this new organisation.", "1408": "Alcuin of York (/\u02c8\u00e6lkw\u026an/;[1] Latin: Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus; c. 735 \u2013 19 May 804)\u00a0\u2013 also called Ealhwine, Alhwin, or Alchoin\u00a0\u2013 was a scholar, clergyman, poet, and teacher from York, Northumbria. He was born around 735 and became the student of Archbishop Ecgbert at York. At the invitation of Charlemagne, he became a leading scholar and teacher at the Carolingian court, where he remained a figure in the 780s and 790s. Before that, he was also a court chancellor in Aachen.  \"The most learned man anywhere to be found\", according to Einhard's Life of Charlemagne[2] (c.\u2009817\u2013833), he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the Carolingian Renaissance. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era./nDuring this  period, he perfected Carolingian minuscule, an easily read manuscript hand using a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters.[3] Latin paleography in the eighth century leaves little room for a single origin of the script, and sources contradict his importance as  no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script.[4] Carolingian minuscule was already in use before Alcuin arrived in Francia.[5] Most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script[6] while at the same time restoring the purity of the form.[7]/nAlcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. In 796, he was made abbot of Marmoutier Abbey, in Tours, where he remained until his death./nAlcuin was born in Northumbria, presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin.[8] In common hagiographical fashion, the Vita Alcuini asserts that Alcuin was \"of noble English stock\", and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint Willibrord; and Beornrad (also spelled Beornred), abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens.[9] Willibrord, Alcuin and Beornrad were all related by blood.[10][11]/nIn his Life of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a paterfamilias, had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the Humber, which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing paterfamilias (\"head of a family, householder\") usually referred to a ceorl (\"churl\"), Donald A. Bullough suggests that Alcuin's family was of cierlisc (\"churlish\") status: i.e., free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy.[9] If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as Deira.[12]/nThe young Alcuin came to the cathedral church of York during the golden age of Archbishop Ecgbert and his brother, the Northumbrian King Eadberht. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the Venerable Bede, who urged him to raise York to an archbishopric. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and reorganisation of the English church, with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.[13]/nThe York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters.[14] From here, Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the Frankish court. He revived the school with the trivium and quadrivium disciplines,[15] writing a codex on the trivium, while his student Hraban wrote one on the quadrivium./nAlcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of St Peter's School, began after Aelbert became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time, Alcuin became a deacon in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had./nIn 781, King Elfwald sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, Eanbald I. On his way home, he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of Parma.[a]/nAlcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars whom Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the Carolingian Renaissance: Peter of Pisa, Paulinus of Aquileia, Rado, and Abbot Fulrad. Alcuin would later write, \"the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles\"./nAlcuin became master of the Palace School of Charlemagne in Aachen (Urbs Regale) in 782.[15] It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the liberal arts, and most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons Pepin and Louis, as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the palace chapel. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'./nIn this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, \"Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe.\" His arguments seem to have prevailed \u2013 Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.[16]/nCharlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king David. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames.[17] Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at Aachen, Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils \u2013 derived mainly from Virgil's Eclogues.[18] According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, \"He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king's esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.\"[19]/nAfter the death of Pope Adrian I, Alcuin was commissioned by Charlemagne to compose an epitaph for Adrian. The epitaph was inscribed on black stone quarried at Aachen and carried to Rome where it was set over Adrian's tomb in the south transept of St Peter's basilica just before Charlemagne's coronation in the basilica on Christmas Day 800.[20]/nIn 790, Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the Adoptionist heresy, which was at that time making great progress in Toledo, the old capital of the Visigoths and still a major city for the Christians under Islamic rule in Spain. He is believed to have had contacts with Beatus of Li\u00e9bana, from the Kingdom of Asturias, who fought against Adoptionism. At the Council of Frankfurt in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by Felix of Urgel, an heresiarch according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia.[15] Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King \u00c6thelred in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home./nHe was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to \u00c6thelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of Lindisfarne, and to \u00c6thelhard, Archbishop of Canterbury in the succeeding months, dealing with the Viking attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, \"De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii\", provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: \"Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of St Cuthbert, splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments.\"/nIn 796, Alcuin was in his 60s. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put Marmoutier Abbey into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There, he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful Carolingian minuscule script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.[19]/nAlcuin died on 19 May 804, some 10 years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:[21]/nDust, worms, and ashes now\u00a0...\nAlcuin my name, wisdom I always loved,\nPray, reader, for my soul./nThe majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. Also, autobiographical sections are in Alcuin's poem on York and in the Vita Alcuini, a hagiography written for him at Ferri\u00e8res in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils./nThe collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes (\"Problems to Sharpen Youths\")[22] is sometimes attributed to Alcuin.[23][24] In a 799 letter to Charlemagne, the scholar claimed to have sent \"certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness\",[25] which some scholars have identified with the Propositiones.[26]\n[b]\nThe text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve river crossings, including the problem of three anxious brothers, each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled[27] (Problem 17); the problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage (Problem 18); and the problem of \"the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults\" (Problem 19). Alcuin's sequence is the solution to one of the problems of that book./nAlcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy, the Carolingian minuscule based on round and legible uncial letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to Arno, bishop of Salzburg and above all to Charlemagne. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the Carolingian age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and in the midst of these pursuits, he died./nAlcuin is the most prominent figure of the Carolingian Renaissance, in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the English are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of Theodulf the Visigoth is preponderant./nAlcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work \u2013 a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics. These are written in the form of a dialogue, and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several theological treatises: a De fide Trinitatis, and commentaries on the Bible.[28] Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known question mark, though it did not resemble the modern symbol.[29]/nAlcuin transmitted to the Franks the knowledge of Latin culture, which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of Venantius Fortunatus, he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae. At the same time, he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on Old English poetry surviving from the early Middle Ages, in a letter to one Speratus, the bishop of an unnamed English see (possibly Unwona of Leicester): \"verba Dei legantur in sacerdotali convivio: ibi decet lectorem audiri, non citharistam; sermones patrum, non carmina gentilium. Quid Hinieldus cum Christo?\" (\"Let God's words be read at the episcopal dinner-table. It is right that a reader should be heard, not a harpist, patristic discourse, not pagan song. What has Ingeld to do with Christ?\").[30]/nHistorian John Boswell cited Alcuin's writings as demonstrating a personal outpouring of his internalized homosexual feelings.[31][32] Others agree that Alcuin at times \"comes perilously close to communicating openly his same-sex desires.\"[33] According to David Clark, passages in some of Alcuin's writings can be seen to display homosocial desire, even possibly homoerotic imagery. However, he argues that it is not possible to necessarily determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings on the part of Alcuin.[34]/nThe interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by Allen Frantzen, who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian amicitia or friendship.[35][c] Douglas Dales and Rowan Williams say \"the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the Song of Songs transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship \u2013 'an ordained affection'\".[36]/nAlcuin was also a close friend of Charlemagne's sister Gisela, Abbess of Chelles, and he hailed her as \"a noble sister in the bond of sweet love\".[37] He wrote to Charlemagne's daughters Rotrude and Bertha, \"the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me\".[38] He dedicated the last two books of his commentary on John's gospel to them both.[38]/nDespite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of Sodom had been punished with fire for \"sinning against nature with men\"\u00a0\u2013 a view consistent with Church teaching. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the Flood, and merit to be \"withered by flames unto eternal barrenness\".[39]/nAlcuin is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 20 May the first available day after the day of his death (as Dunstan is celebrated on 19 May).[40][41]/nAlcuin College, one of the colleges of the University of York, is named after him.[42] In January 2020, Alcuin was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.[43]/nFor a complete census of Alcuin's works, see Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jullien and Fran\u00e7oise Perelman, eds., Clavis scriptorum latinorum medii aevi: Auctores Galliae 735\u2013987.

She served as Minister for People's Education in the state of Thuringia between 1947 and 1950.[1] Some sources identify her as \"the first-ever female minister (on state or national level) in the history of Germany\".[a] Others are content to record that, within Germany, she was the first-ever female minister in the state of Thuringia.[3][4]/nMarie Torhorst stated and proved what is today known as the Carath\u00e9odory-Torhorst theorem in her 1918 doctoral dissertation. The dissertation was subsequently lost and Torhorst's contribution was for many decades overlooked; but in the twenty-first century mathematics scholars are happy to acknowledge and celebrate her work.[3][5]/nMarie Torhorst was born at the end of the so-called \"Year of the Three Emperors\" in Ledde, then as now a sleepy village in the flat countryside west of Osnabr\u00fcck. She was the seventh and youngest child of Arnold Torhorst (1841\u20131909), the local parson and his wife, born Luise Smend (1847\u20131923).[6]   The family seems to have been intellectually gifted. Marie's elder sister, Adelheid, would also achieve a measure of eminence in teaching and, after 1945, in politics.[7] The sisters would later, jointly, have a secondary school named after them.[8] Luise Torhorst had inherited a useful sum of money as a result of which she was able to see to it that not just her four sons, but also her three daughters, received a full education.[7] Marie completed her own schooling at an \"Oberlyzeum\" (single-sex girls' secondary school).[9]/nSources are not completely consistent as to when she embarked on her university education, much of which coincided with the First World War. She attended the University of Bonn, studying Geography, Mathematics and Physics. There are at least two reference to her having also studied at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.[1][4]It was from Bonn that in 1918 she received her doctorate:  the work was supervised by Hans Hahn. Her dissertation was entitled \"\u00dcber die Randmenge einfach-zusammenh\u00e4ngender ebener Gebiete\":[5] a core conclusion has become known among her scholarly admirers as the Carath\u00e9odory-Torhorst theorem or, more simply, as the Torhorst theorem.[3][10] It might have been thought that her doctorate should have provided a launch pad for a life-long career in the universities sector. There were still vanishingly few women working in high-level academic research at this time, however, and at least one commentator has identified \"a lack of confidence in her own mathematical ability\" in her autobiography.[5] Also, with Germany economically, militarily and politically broken and on the brink of a year of revolutions in the ports and industrial centres, there was widespread nervousness that Lenin's so-called October Revolution might yet spread uncontrollably through the European continent. Marie Torhorst's own student record of left-wing political activism was no secret.[4][11]/nShe joined the socialist \"Studenten-Arbeitsgemeinschaft\" (apparently an umbrella group of socialist student associations) in 1917.[4]   According to one source she passed the exams necessary to qualify her for teaching in state schools in 1919 and 1920.[1]   Elsewhere it is indicated that she had already attended the \"Stift Keppel\" in Allenbach, where she successfully completed a two years teacher-training course in her early 20s, between 1903 and 1905.[12]   During the early twentieth century her political record made it hard for her to find a permanent teaching post. She was able to find a part-time teaching position at a Catholic girls' school in Bonn, however, and also found work with the university as a university librarian.  It was probably in 1922/23 that she completed several terms of study at the \"Handelshochschule\" (loosely, \"business college\", at the time being subsumed into the university) in Cologne, studying business administration and economics, following which she received a qualification in teaching business studies.[1][4]/nIn 1923 Torhorst took on the headship of a private business school for the \"Frauenerwerbs- und Ausbildungsverein\" (loosely, \"Women's employment and training association\") in Bremen.[13]   She continued to lead the business school till 1929.[1]   She also teamed up with politically like-minded teacher colleagues, during this period, to organise evening courses for young people who had been excluded from state schools in the area.[14]/nHer political and feminist beliefs had been deeply rooted in Torhorst's personal values and life choices since at least as far back as the First World War, but it was only in 1928 that she became a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).[1]   It was in the same year that she joined the \"Freie Lehrergewerkschaft Deutschlands\" / FLGD, a teachers' trades union committed to socialist principals.[b]   There are indications that within the SPD, as a left-wing member of the party, she often found herself out of sympathy with the party leadership.[15]/nBetween 1929 and 1933, Marie Torhorst taught and worked as a \"Studienr\u00e4tin\" (loosely, \"student counsellor\") at the Karl Marx School which had been set up in 1921 in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln by the education pioneer Fritz Karsen, and then progressively expanded under Karsen's direction during the years that followed. There was much about the school which was considered innovative at the time. In 1929 Karsen took the bold step of turning it into a \"Gesamtschule\" (loosely, \"comprehensive school\"), intended to educate children displaying the widest possible range of abilities. Another appealing feature for Torhorst was an underpinning philosophy which insisted that academically talented working class children should have the same opportunities as the children of more prosperous and/or well educated parents to pass the \"Abitur\" (secondary school final exam). The significance of the \"Abitur\" in Germany was (and is) that passing it opens the way to university-level education. Torhorst's four years at the school included, in 1932, a six month study trip to the Soviet Union.[4][16]  Her half year in the Soviet Union left a lasting impression./nThe early 1930s were marked by an intensification of Germany's political polarisation. In the Reichstag (parliament) this was reflected in political deadlock. In January 1933 the Hitler government took power and rapidly transformed Germany into a one-party dictatorship. A progressive school in a traditionally left-wing district of Berlin named in honour of Karl Marx was, unsurprisingly, high on the National Socialist hate list. Bernhard Rust was installed as acting Prussian Minister for the Arts and Education on 4 February 1933 (following the dismissal of his predecessor in the office), and on 21 February 1933 Rust dismissed Karsen from the headship of his own school. The teaching staff were dismissed, and when the school reopened later that year it was with a new name, a new set of teachers, and a large swastika flag hanging in the main hall. Karsen emigrated.[17]   Marie Torhorst's teaching career was evidently over.[16]/nAs soon as Hitler took power Marie's older sister, Adelheid, emigrated to the Netherlands and stayed there for the next twelve years. In 1934 she embarked on a six month marriage of convenience with a man called Jacob \nJacobs. Her own resulting change of name, from Adelheid Torhorst to Adelheid Jacobs, turned out to have been prescient.  After the German army invaded the Netherlands in 1940, her new name protected her from Nazi persecution.[7] The two sisters had always been close, both politically engaged, both teachers, both unmarried and childless. But Marie Torhorst chose a different course and stayed in Germany. As far as her public self was concerned, hr first job after losing her teaching position was as a catering assistant. She later found a job as an appointments administrator at the Berlin University Hygiene Institute, and another as a typist in the travel office correspondence section of an American Express (AMEXCO) branch. She was, in addition, entitled to receive a pension in respect of the six years during which she had worked as head of a private business school in Bremen between 1923 and 1929, but this pension was payable by the \"Reichsversicherungsanstalt\", a government agency. It was not paid to her. According to her own understanding set out in a letter to a friend at the time, changes to the law implemented in 1934/35 meant that she was unable to litigate the matter. In addition to her day jobs, Torhorst gave every sign of being part of the new social order emerging in Germany. Between 1935 and 1940 she was a registered member both of the German Labour Front and of the German Red Cross.[16]/nAccording to her own detailed, albeit largely uncorroborated, records she was also a member of other organisations that operated, as far as possible, out of the sight of the homeland security. As soon as she lost her teaching job at beginning of 1933 she became an activist member of \"Parole\", a locally based resistance group in Berlin-Neuk\u00f6lln. In this group, together with former pupils from the progressive school at which she had taught between 1929 and 1933, she produced an underground anti-government newspaper, also called \"Parole\".  There are indications that she was also involved in underground political discussion groups, and in smuggling out information about conditions in Germany to the exiled Communist Party leadership groups that had ended up after 1933 in Paris, Prague and Moscow, using her communications with her sister in the Netherlands as a conduit.[16]/nThe authorities seem to have known (or suspected) that the teachers who had lost their jobs when the Karl Marx School in Neuk\u00f6lln had been taken over would (or might) have kept in touch and formed some sort of a resistance organisation. Marie Torhorst was first called in for questioning by the Gestapo in 1937. She was accused of undertaking political work for the (by now illegal) SPD, but she was able to refute the accusation and was released, presumably \"for lack of evidence\". War broke out in September 1939.  Within Germany, government persecution of political opponents and of Jews intensified progressively till the Shoah reached its brutish nadir in 1942. During this time Marie Torhorst concealed one of her former pupils and his mother, also providing the two of them with food. The young man was in particular danger from the government, since he was both Jewish and a Communist. At some point during 1943 someone informed the authorities of the situation. Sources are silent over what happened to the people she had been hiding, but Marie Torhorst herself was detained and taken to the \"Hallendorf labour camp\" by Watenstedt, near Braunschweig. Given the personal network that she would have acquired during her teaching career, and given her strong political and social opinions, it is likely that Torhorst will have responded to many opportunities to help victims and potential victims of government persecution between 1933 and 1945, and commentators bemoan the lack of relevant research undertaken on the details of resistance activism in Berlin and other German cities. However, many of the actions involved will have depended on maximum secrecy to have been effective, and it therefore seems likely that most of the details will remain unknown.[16]/nBefore the war ended Torhorst had been released from the labour camp and returned to Berlin. Here she returned to the job in the archives department job with the \"Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Betriebswirtschaft\" (loosely, \"German Society for Business Administration\") in which she had already been employed between 1939 and her arrest in 1943.[18]   During the final months of the war she was also involved in looking after German prisoners of War under the auspices of the \"Reichsgruppe Handwerk\" (a government backed craftworkers' organisation).[18]/nThe end of the war in May 1945 marked an end to the Hitler nightmare and new beginnings for millions of Germans. There were choices to be made. The western two thirds of Germany had ended up divided into four military occupation zones, administered respectively by the British, the Americans, the French and the Soviets. The region surrounding Berlin, along with the ruins and rubble comprising eastern part of the city itself, were administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Torhorst had spent the Hitler years based in Berlin and she now made her choice:  she joined the (no longer outlawed) Communist Party in or before January 1946.[16][18]/nShe was actively engaged in various education related functions from the middle part of 1945. Between August 1945 and July 1946 she took charge at the department in charge of teacher training for the education department of Greater Berlin. In April 1946 a new political party was created in the Soviet occupation zone by means of a contentious political merger between the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. It is probable that the architects of this arrangement intended that it should take effect across all four occupation zones, but as matters turned out the Socialist Unity Party (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\" / SED) never gained traction outside the Soviet zone. Nevertheless, in East Berlin Marie Torhorst was one of hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members who lost no time in signing their party memberships over to what became, over the next few years, the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship.  The party unification congress of April 1946 also saw a widespread transfer of political powers over various aspects of daily life, including education, to the control of the new Party. Marie Torhorst meanwhile emerged as a true believer in the new order. She saw herself as an intellectual-worker, determined to support the building of a new Germany, truly socialist in spirit and vision. After twelve years of Hitler, actions for the creation of an antifascist future must be genuine, and not just a matter for empty rhetoric. The political beliefs which she had developed and by which she had lived under the German Republic before 1933 provided a sound basis on which, under the Soviet military administration,  it would be possible develop and apply her ideas for the education system. It now became apparent just how much she had been impressed by Soviet education during her six month study visit to Moscow in 1932. Towards the end of 1946 she held a meeting with Fritz Karsen, the education pioneer at whose school she had worked as a teacher between 1929 and 1933. He was back in (west) Berlin , now working for the US military administration as an education officer. When he asked Torhorst how it could be possible to work only \"under Russian pressure\", she replied that she had never felt \"so free and happy\". Now she found she could \"join in with the creation of everything that she had always strived to achieve as a teacher, without having to make any of those fundamental comprises\".[16]/nBetween May 1945 and October 1949 the Soviet occupation zone underwent a carefully choreographed nation building programme based on plans many of which had, as it turned out, been devised in some detail in Moscow between 1941 and 1945 by the men who now held the levers of power (subject to Soviet supervision). On 29 May 1947 Torhorst was chosen to serve as \"Minister for People's Education\" in the state of Thuringia. It was a remarkable development.[19]  The recently launched women's weekly magazine \"Die Frau von heute\" carried her portrait on its front page, accompanied by the headline \"Frauen als Minister ..... [habe] Deutschland noch nicht gesehen\" (loosely, \"Women as ministers    .... a new experience for Germany\"   There was a brief article spelling out that her appointment was justified by \"long years of specialist knowledge\", but also acknowledging that \"as a woman she ... [would be] exposed to exceptional levels of criticism\". Nevertheless, \"for all the women in the east\" the appointment represented a melting away of the former indifference over women being able to determine their own futures. Even though it had in the past been the case that \"a few thousand of her gender-comrades, who came from the more favourably positioned classes, found their way into some of the higher professions, such as medicine, academic life or equivalent levels in public service\", Torhorst's appointment as a minister showed that \"the whole situation for the female gender has changed fundamentally, since their equality of value and equality of entitlement with men\" was officially recognised, and thereby their \"gender-subservience\" had been done away with.[16][20]/nTorhorst herself also used the press to share with comrades some of her ambitions for her new role. These included the necessity \"to bring an end to the still major differences between urban and rural schooling provision\". She also shared her opinion that there was \"still much more to be done to lay down a genuinely democratic basis for the development of a highly qualified and progressive German intelligentsia\". Indispensable to that ambition was \"a substantial increase in the proportion of university students with working class backgrounds\". She would therefore make it her top priority to ensure that \"the treasures of culture and learning do not simply benefit a small number of comrades at the top of society\".[20]   An interesting insight into her education philosophy as minister comes from a surviving record of a \"conversation\" that Torhorst held with an American delegation on 27 June 1947, shortly after her appointment to ministerial office:  \"The most important work ... would be implementation of the law to democratise German schools\". In this connection \"Unity schools must be implemented in the Soviet zone\".[16][c]/nThere was a strong, if ill-defined, expectation on both sides of what would become known as the \"inner German border\" that the four military occupation zones of Germany would at some stage be rehabilitated and unified into a single post-fascist state, but visions of how such a state would be governed differed starkly, especially after 1948. During the twelve month Berlin blockade thoughts of any future German reunification disappeared over the horizon, and in October 1949 the Soviet zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It was also during 1949 that Adelheid returned from the Netherlands and moved in with Marie. The two sisters, still unmarried, childless, and still \u2013 in their different ways \u2013 deeply engaged in the politics of education, made their home together in Weimar, which till 1952 was the seat of the state government for Thuringia.[7][d]   In 1950 Marie Torhorst lost her position as Thuringian Minister for People's Education. Significantly Isolde Oschmann, her successor, appointed only in 1951, was another woman. Isolde Oschmann was a former Kindergarten teacher who turned out to be very much less of a hands-on education minister that Torhorst had been:  her footprint on East German history remained slight despite her having held ministerial office for more than a year.[22]   It remains unclear why Marie Torhorst was replaced in the role.[23]  There is no very obvious indication from her subsequent public career that she was among those who fell out of favour with the party leadership at this time.[16][19]/nTorhorst then served, briefly during 1951/52, as political secretary with the East Berlin office of the \"Internationale Demokratische Frauenf\u00f6deration\" (IDFF / \"Women's International Democratic Federation\").  She also accepted an invitation from Paul Wandel, East Germany's Minister for Education, to take over the running of the important \"Arts Exhibition of the People's Republic of China\" which was held in East Berlin during 1950/51.\nIn 1952 she joined the East German Education Ministry as head of the department for cultural relations with foreign countries, a position she retained till 1957.  Between 1958 and 1962 she taught at the (East) German National Pedagogical Institute, where in 1962 she also accepted a professorship. Through the 1950s and early 1960s Torhorst held a number of other, mostly short-term and part-time complementary appointments relating to her educational experience and expertise. Beyond the world of education, she also served between 1957 and 1960 as an honorary deputy president of the \"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\" (DFD / \"(East) German Democratic Women's League\". After 1964, the year of her seventy-sixth birthday, she continued to engage actively in education related projects and discussions, but now on a free-lance basis.[1][18][19]/nMarie Torhorst died in East Berlin on 7 May 1989. Despite her considerable age, she was very far from forgotten at the time of her death. There were obituaries both from the East German ministry of Education and from the Central Committee. She had lived out her final years in a special retirement home set aside for \"party veterans\".[16][19][24]/nAfter reunification it emerged that Marie Torhorst had been a longstanding and active Secret Informant for the Ministry for State security. When the Stasi files were investigated, her earliest surviving report was found to date from 1953. Most Stasi informants produced reports on the daily movements and conversations of their work colleagues and / or family members, but Torhorst had been targeted and recruited after it was noticed, from routine monitoring of her personal letters, that she had excellent contacts with a number of persons of interest on the far side of the \"inner German border\". No doubt it was considered useful that she was always herself a compulsive writer of long detailed letters to friends and contacts. On account of her links to the East German government she also enjoyed exceptional travel privileges at a time when East Germany was becoming became ever more physically isolated from the west.  Those on whom she submitted reports included her cousin, the respected professor of church law Rudolf Smend, the popular historian Wolfgang Leonhardt and the journalist Stephan Grzeskowiak. (Stephan Grzeskowiak was, in addition, one of Torhorst's former pupils from her time as a teacher at the Karl Marx School in Neuk\u00f6lln during the early 1930s and, more recently, had been a party insider with the team surrounding Kurt Schumacher, the recently deceased leader if the SPD in the west. His ongoing links, as a journalist, with SPD politicians in Bonn during the 1950s, 60s and 70s were of particular interest to Torhorst's Stasi handlers.)[19][25]   In 1958 her Stasi handlers marked the seventieth birthday of \"GI Sophie\" (the codename by which she was identified in the files) with a hamper worth 75 (western) marks, accompanied by a note commending the way in which she had \"fulfilled all her assignments in an exemplary manner  ... [and showed] a keen of interest in [the Stasi's] work\". It does appear that her reports were not just long, but also both detailed and, at times, remarkably \"readable\" and even \"chatty\". She was indeed unusual among Stasi informants in her willingness to submit unsolicited advice, for instance concerning books from the west which should probably not be permitted to circulate in East Germany, or ways in which East German radio programmes might more effectively counter the \"western propaganda\" broadcast by the U.S. backed RIAS (radio station) from West Berlin.

He is often credited as the founder of modern maritime navigation; his book The New American Practical Navigator, first published in 1802, is still carried on board every commissioned U.S. Naval vessel. In 2001, an elementary and middle school in Salem was named in his honor./nNathaniel Bowditch, the fourth of seven children, was born in Salem, Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Habakkuk Bowditch, a cooper who at one point was a sailor as well but stopped after his ship went aground in 1775,[1] and Mary Ingersoll Bowditch. At the age of ten, he was made to leave school to work in his father's cooperage, before becoming indentured at twelve for nine years as a bookkeeping apprentice to a ship chandler. Here is where he first learned bookkeeping, an important step in his life./nIn 1786, age fourteen, Bowditch began to study algebra and two years later he taught himself calculus. He also taught himself Latin in 1790 and French in 1792 so he was able to read mathematical works such as Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. He found thousands of errors in John Hamilton Moore's The New Practical Navigator; at eighteen, he copied all the mathematical papers of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Among his many significant scientific contributions would be a translation of Pierre-Simon de Laplace's M\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste, a lengthy work on mathematics and theoretical astronomy. This translation was critical to the development of astronomy in the United States.[2]/nSerendipity aided Bowditch's self-directed study, in as much as he found himself able to use the eminent Irish chemist Richard Kirwan's library: Hugh Hill, a privateer from Salem who captained the Pilgrim, had intercepted the ship carrying the library between Ireland and England and brought the library back to Salem in 1781./nIn 1795, Bowditch went to sea on the first of four voyages as a ship's clerk and captain's writer. His fifth voyage was as master and part owner of a ship. Following this voyage, he returned to Salem in 1803 to resume his mathematical studies and enter the insurance business. One of his family homes in Salem, the Nathaniel Bowditch House, still exists and was restored in 2000.[3] This house has been designated a National Historic Landmark./nIn 1798 Bowditch married Elizabeth Boardman, who died seven months later. In 1800 Bowditch married his second wife and cousin, Mary \"Polly\" Ingersoll Bowditch (1781\u20131834). They had 2 daughters and 6 sons, including Henry Ingersoll Bowditch. Among his grandchildren were Henry Pickering Bowditch and Charles Pickering Bowditch./nIn 1802, his book The American Practical Navigator was first published. That same year, Harvard University awarded Bowditch an honorary degree./nIn 1804, Bowditch became America's first insurance actuary as president of the Essex Fire and Marine Insurance Company in Salem. Under his direction, the company prospered despite difficult political conditions and the War of 1812./nBowditch's mathematical and astronomical work during this time earned him a significant standing, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1799[4] and the American Philosophical Society in 1809.[5] He was offered the chair of mathematics and physics at Harvard in 1806, but turned it down. In 1804, an article on his observations of the Moon was published and in 1806 he published naval charts of several harbors, including Salem. More scientific publications followed, including a study of a meteor explosion (1807), three papers on the orbits of comets (1815, 1818, 1820) and a study of the Lissajous figures created by the motion of a pendulum suspended from two points (1815)./nIn 1816, Harvard awarded Nathaniel Bowditch an honorary Doctor of Laws.[6]/nAs well as Harvard, the United States Military Academy and the University of Virginia offered Bowditch chairs in mathematics. Bowditch again refused these offers, perhaps (in the case of the University of Virginia) because the $2,000 salary offered was two-thirds of the salary he received as president of the insurance company./nBowditch's translation of the first four volumes of Laplace's Trait\u00e9 de m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste was completed by 1818. Publication of the work, however, was delayed for many years, most likely due to cost. Nonetheless, he continued to work on it with the assistance of Benjamin Peirce, adding commentaries that doubled its length./nBy 1819, Bowditch's international reputation had grown to the extent that he was elected as a member of the Royal Societies of Edinburgh and  London, and the Royal Irish Academy./nIn 1823, Bowditch left the Essex Fire and Marine Insurance Company to become an actuary for the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company in Boston. There he served as a \"money manager\" (an investment manager) for wealthy individuals who made their fortunes at sea, directing their wealth toward manufacturing. Towns such as Lowell prospered as a result./nBowditch's move from Salem to Boston involved the transfer of over 2,500 books, 100 maps and charts, and 29 volumes of his own manuscripts./nDuring his time at sea, Bowditch became intensely interested in the mathematics involved in celestial navigation. He worked initially with John Hamilton Moore's London-published Navigator, which was known to have errors. To have exact tables to work from, Bowditch recomputed all of Moore's tables, and rearranged and expanded the work. He contacted the US publisher of the work, Edmund March Blunt, who asked him to correct and revise the third edition on his fifth voyage. The task was so extensive that Bowditch decided to write his own book, and to \"put down in the book nothing I can't teach the crew\". On that trip, it is said that every man of the crew of 12, including the ship's cook, became competent to take and calculate lunar observations and to plot the correct position of the ship./nIn 1802 Blunt published the first edition of Bowditch's American Practical Navigator, which became the western hemisphere shipping industry standard for the next century and a half. The text included several solutions to the spherical triangle problem that were new, as well as extensive formulae and tables for navigation. In 1866, the United States Hydrographic Office purchased the copyright and since that time the book has been in continuous publication, with regular revisions to keep it current.  Bowditch's influence on the American Practical Navigator was so profound that to this day mariners refer to it simply as Bowditch.  Student Naval officers prior to the establishment of the Naval Academy referred to the work as \"the immaculate Bowditch\"./nBowditch died in Boston in 1838 from stomach cancer. He is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery, where a monument to him was erected through public collections./nThe statue was the first life-size bronze to be cast in America.  It was the creation of renowned sculptor Robert Ball Hughes./nThe following eulogy was written by the Salem Marine Society:/nIn his death a public, a national, a human benefactor has departed. Not this community nor our country only, but the whole world has reason to do honor to his memory. When the voice of eulogy shall cease to flow, no monument will be needed to keep alive his memory among men; but as long as ships shall sail, the needle point to the north, and the stars go through their wonted courses in the heavens, the name of Dr. Bowditch will be revered as of one who has helped his fellowmen in time of need, who was and is a guide to them over the pathless oceans, and one who forwarded the great interests of mankind./nIn the 1840s and 1850s, Bowditch's son, H. I. Bowditch, ran the \"Bowditch Library\" on Otis Place in Boston's Financial District.[7] It was \"free to those who reside in Boston, or in the vicinity. ... This is the library of the late Nathaniel Bowditch, and is almost exclusively of a scientific character.\"[8] In 1858 the family gave the collection, \"which consists mostly of mathematical and astronomical works\", to the Boston Public Library.[9]/nThe Oceanographic Survey Ship USNS\u00a0Bowditch and the Nathaniel Bowditch, a high-speed catamaran passenger ferry serving downtown Boston and Salem,[10] were named for him, as was a lunar crater. Additionally, a William Hand\u2013designed Schooner built in 1922, which is currently part of the Maine Windjammer fleet and sails out of Rockland, Maine, is also named after Nathaniel Bowditch.[11]/nIn 1955, a book for younger readers, Carry On, Mr. Bowditch, was published by Jean Lee Latham, portraying Bowditch's life dramatized and fictionalized. A serious modern biography is Robert E. Berry's Yankee Stargazer, published in 1941./nA grammar school, two middle schools and a dorm in America were also named for him, in Boston, Foster City, California (Bowditch Middle School), Salem, Massachusetts and Salem State College, respectively. The Department of Marine Transportation building on the grounds of the United States Merchant Marine Academy is named in his honor and houses classrooms, laboratories, and the 900-seat Ackerman Auditorium.  He also gives his name to a street in Berkeley, California. Actor David Morse was named after him \u2212 David Bowditch Morse.[12]/nBowditch Point Park, in Fort Myers Beach, Florida, is named for Bowditch.[13]/nBowditch was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2014.[14]", "70092379": "Sophia Hazel Levy McDonald (December 12, 1888 \u2013 December 6, 1963) was an American astronomer, numerical analyst, and mathematics educator.[1] She became the second tenured woman on mathematics faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, at a time when it was unusual for top mathematics programs to have even one female mathematician.[2] Her main research topic concerned the orbits of comets and minor planets.[1]/nLevy majored in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1910, and continued at the university for graduate study in astronomy, supporting herself as Watson Assistant in Astronomy, University Fellow in Astronomy, assistant to the dean of the graduate division, and secretary to the California State Board of Education. She completed her Ph.D. in 1920, but continued in her secretarial work for a few more years, returning to the university to manage the office of the University of California Press and again taking a position as assistant to the dean.[1]/nAfter obtaining a position as a research assistant in astronomy, she was hired in 1921 or 1923 as an instructor in mathematics. She obtained a tenure-track position as assistant professor in 1924 or 1925,[3] the second to do so after Pauline Sperry. Beginning in 1933, six mathematics faculty members including Levy, Annie Biddle, three male instructors, and a male assistant professor were all considered for termination, as part of an increased push for research excellence at the university that also included the hire of Griffith C. Evans as a new department chair in 1936. Biddle was let go, with the explanation that because she had married she did not need to remain employed, while the three male instructors were kept on, with the explanation for at least one being that because he was married and had a child he did need to remain employed. Levy and the other assistant professor were also kept on, in Levy's case at least in part because she was unmarried and was supporting another family member, her mother.[2]/nContinuing at Berkeley, Levy helped found the Northern California Section of the Mathematical Association of America in 1939, and served as its second chair and later as its sectional governor. She was also councilor general of Pi Mu Epsilon. She was tenured as an associate professor in 1940, and promoted to full professor in 1949.

The marriage came after McDonald's retirement from Berkeley.[1] By waiting for his retirement to marry him, Levy evaded the university's anti-nepotism rules which might well have terminated her job (but not his) if they married while he was still an active faculty member, as happened for instance at another university to Josephine M.

His mathematical talent was encouraged by a method of teaching, which left it up to the students to find mathematical proofs. He began studying mathematics at the University of Lviv in December 1939, at the time when the Lw\u00f3w school mathematics was still active. Among his teachers were Juliusz Schauder, Stanis\u0142aw Mazur, Bronislaw Knaster, and Edward Szpilrajn, who organized a student conference in 1940 in Lviv, also attended by Stefan Banach.[1][2]/nIn June 1941, during the occupation of Lw\u00f3w the Germans, Vishik left the city with a Komsomol group.

After fleeing further to Krasnodar, Vishik passed Dniprodzerzhynsk and for two months helped with the harvest in Timashevsk./nHe was a student at the pedagogical university in Krasnodar, but because of advancing German troops he then fled further to Makhachkala, where he studied for a year. He fell ill with malaria, but managed to hide on a military train in the fall of 1942 and reached Tbilisi. Vishik was already acquainted with Nikoloz Muskhelishvili, mathematician and president in 1941, founded the Georgian Academy of Sciences, whom he met during  Muskhelishvili's visit to Lw\u00f3w (probably in 1940) and was therefore ready to start studying in Tbilisi./nThe Mathematical Institute was run by Ilia Vekua there were lectures by V.

He has been the managing editor of the Journal of Differential Geometry since 2003. His awards and honors include:/nIn 1982, Richard S. Hamilton introduced the Ricci flow, proving a dramatic new theorem on the geometry of three-dimensional manifolds.[1] Cao, who had just begun his Ph.D. studies under Shing-Tung Yau, began to study the Ricci flow in the setting of K\u00e4hler manifolds. In his Ph.D. thesis, published in 1985, he showed that Yau's estimates in the resolution of the Calabi conjecture could be modified to the K\u00e4hler-Ricci flow context, to prove a convergence theorem similar to Hamilton's original result.[2] This also provided a parabolic alternative to Yau's method of continuity in the proof of the Calabi conjecture, although much of the technical work in the proofs is similar./nFollowing a suggestion of Yau's that the Ricci flow could be used to prove William Thurston's Geometrization conjecture, Hamilton developed the theory over the following two decades. In 2002 and 2003, Grisha Perelman posted two articles to the arXiv in which he claimed to present a proof, via the Ricci flow, of the geometrization conjecture.[3][4] Additionally, he posted a third article in which he gave a shortcut to the proof of the famous Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, for which the results in the second half of the second paper were unnecessary.[5] Perelman's papers were immediately recognized as giving notable new results in the theory of Ricci flow, although many mathematicians were unable to fully understand the technical details of some unusually complex or terse sections in his work./nBruce Kleiner of Yale University and John Lott of the University of Michigan began posting annotations of Perelman's first two papers to the web in 2003, adding to and modifying them over the next several years. The results of this work were published in an academic journal in 2008.[6] Cao collaborated with Xi-Ping Zhu of Zhongshan University, publishing an exposition in 2006 of Hamilton's work and of Perelman's first two papers, explaining them in the context of the mathematical literature on geometric analysis. John Morgan of Columbia University and Gang Tian of Princeton University published a book in 2007 on Perelman's first and third paper, and the first half of the second paper; they later published a second book on the second half of Perelman's second paper.[7][8]/nThe abstract of Cao and Zhu's article states/nIn this paper, we give a complete proof of the Poincar\u00e9 and the geometrization conjectures. This work depends on the accumulative works of many geometric analysts in the past thirty years. This proof should be considered as the crowning achievement of the Hamilton-Perelman theory of Ricci flow./nwith introduction beginning/nIn this paper, we shall present the Hamilton-Perelman theory of Ricci flow. Based on it, we shall give the first written account of a complete proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture and the geometrization conjecture of Thurston. While the complete work is an accumulated efforts of many geometric analysts, the major contributors are unquestionably Hamilton and Perelman./nSome observers felt that Cao and Zhu were overstating the value of their paper. Additionally, it was found that a few pages of Cao and Zhu's article were similar to those in Kleiner and Lott's article, leading to accusations of plagiarism. Cao and Zhu said that, in 2003, they had taken notes on that section of Perelman's work from Kleiner and Lott's early postings, and that as an accidental oversight they had failed to realize the source of the notes when writing their article in 2005.[9] They released a revised version of their article to the arXiv in December 2006.[10]/nA gradient Ricci soliton consists of a Riemannian manifold (M, g) and a function f on M such that Ricg + Hessg f is a constant multiple of g. In the special case that M has a complex structure, g is a K\u00e4hler metric, and the gradient of f is a holomorphic vector field, one has a gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton. Ricci solitons are sometimes considered as generalizations of Einstein metrics, which correspond to the case f = 0. The importance of gradient Ricci solitons to the theory of the Ricci flow was first recognized by Hamilton in an influential 1995 article.[11] In Perelman's analysis, the gradient Ricci solitons where the constant multiple is positive are especially important; these are called gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. A 2010 survey of Cao's on Ricci solitons has been widely cited./nIn 1996, Cao studied gradient K\u00e4hler-Ricci solitons under the ansatz of rotational symmetry, so that the Ricci soliton equation reduces to ODE analysis. He showed that for each positive n there is a gradient steady K\u00e4hler-Ricci soliton on \n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {C} ^{n}}\n\n which is rotationally symmetric, complete, and positively curved. In the case that n is equal to 1, this recovers Hamilton's cigar soliton. Cao also showed the existence of gradient steady K\u00e4hler-Ricci solitons on the total space of the canonical bundle over complex projective space which is complete and rotationally symmetric, and nonnegatively curved. He constructed closed examples of gradient shrinking K\u00e4hler-Ricci solitons on the projectivization of certain line bundles over complex projective space; these examples were considered independently by Norihito Koiso.[12] Cao and Koiso's ansatz was pushed further in an influential article of Mikhail Feldman, Tom Ilmanen, and Dan Knopf, and the examples of Cao, Koiso, and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf have been unified and extended in 2011 by Andrew Dancer and McKenzie Wang.[13][14]/nUtilizing an argument of Perelman's, Cao and Detang Zhou showed that complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons have a Gaussian character, in that for any given point p of M, the function f must grow quadratically with the distance function to p. Additionally, the volume of geodesic balls around p can grow at most polynomially with their radius. These estimates make possible much integral analysis to do with complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons, in particular allowing e\u2212f to be used as a weighting function.", "1645": "\u1e24asan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized as Alhazen; /\u00e6l\u02c8h\u00e6z\u0259n/; full name Ab\u016b \u02bfAl\u012b al-\u1e24asan ibn al-\u1e24asan ibn al-Haytham \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u064a\u062b\u0645; c.\u2009965\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091040) was a medieval mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age from present-day Iraq.[6][7][8][9] Referred to as \"the father of modern optics\",[10][11][12] he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular.

His initial influences were in the study of religion and service to the community. At the time, society had a number of conflicting views of religion that he ultimately sought to step aside from religion. This led to him delving into the study of mathematics and science.[40] He held a position with the title vizier in his native Basra, and made a name for himself on his knowledge of applied mathematics. As he claimed to be able to regulate the flooding of the Nile, he was invited to meet the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim in order to realise a hydraulic project at Aswan. However, Ibn al-Haytham was forced to concede the impracticability of his project.[41]/nUpon his return to Cairo, he was given an administrative post. After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well, he contracted the ire of the caliph al-Hakim,[42] and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph's death in 1021, after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him.[43]\nLegend has it that Alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest during this period.[44] During this time, he wrote his influential Book of Optics. Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous University of al-Azhar, and lived from the proceeds of his literary production[45] until his death in c. 1040.[41] (A copy of Apollonius' Conics, written in Ibn al-Haytham's own handwriting exists in Aya Sofya: (MS Aya Sofya 2762, 307 fob., dated Safar 415 A.H.

A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and one in the library of Bruges.[53]/nTwo major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity. The first theory, the emission theory, was supported by such thinkers as Euclid and Ptolemy, who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by Aristotle and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as al-Kindi) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the Book of Optics was from Ptolemy's Optics, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.[54] Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of Galen, and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".[55] This left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye./nWhat Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.[55] He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object\u2014for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.[56] He later asserted (in book seven of the Optics) that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular.[57] His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?[58] His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.[59] However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his De Aspectibus (Book of Optics) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries. Kepler's later theory of the retinal image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.[60]/nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with lenses, mirrors, refraction, and reflection.[61] His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.[62]/nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the visual system. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 Perception article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century Hering's law of equal innervation. He wrote a description of vertical horopters 600 years before Aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's\u2014and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by Panum in 1858.[63] Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from Ptolemy, with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.[64] In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.[65]/nIn a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune[66] and Sabra,[67] Raynaud[68] showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-M\u00fcller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts./nAlhazen's most original contribution was that, after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.[69] His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,[70] which he sought to avoid.[71] He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.[72] He followed Galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved.[73]/nAlhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.[74]/nHis research in catoptrics (the study of optical systems using mirrors) was centred on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration. He made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant, and investigated the magnifying power of a lens.[61]/nAlhazen was the first physicist to give complete statement of the law of reflection.[75][76][77] He was first to state that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface all lie in a same plane perpendicular to reflecting plane.[17][78]/nHis work on catoptrics in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by Ptolemy in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an equation of the fourth degree.[79] This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[80] Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation.\nLater mathematicians used Descartes' analytical methods to analyse the problem.[81] An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M. Elkin, an actuarian.[82] Other solutions were discovered in 1989, by Harald Riede[83] and in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician Peter M. Neumann.[84][85]\nRecently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) researchers solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.[86]/nThe camera obscura was known to the ancient Chinese, and was described by the Han Chinese polymath Shen Kuo in his scientific book Dream Pool Essays, published in the year 1088 C.E. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his Problems, but Alhazen's work contained the first clear description of camera obscura.[87] and early analysis[88] of the device./nIbn al-Haytham used a camera obscura mainly to observe a partial solar eclipse.[89]\nIn his essay, Ibn al-Haytham writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction reads as follows: \"The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle.\"/nIt is admitted that his findings solidified the importance in the history of the camera obscura[90] but this treatise is important in many other respects./nAncient optics and medieval optics were divided into optics and burning mirrors. Optics proper mainly focused on the study of vision, while burning mirrors focused on the properties of light and luminous rays. On the shape of the eclipse is probably one of the first attempts made by Ibn al-Haytham to articulate these two sciences./nVery often Ibn al-Haytham's discoveries benefited from the intersection of mathematical and experimental contributions. This is the case with On the shape of the eclipse. Besides the fact that this treatise allowed more people to study partial eclipses of the sun, it especially allowed to better understand how the camera obscura works. This treatise is a physico-mathematical study of image formation inside the camera obscura. Ibn al-Haytham takes an experimental approach, and determines the result by varying the size and the shape of the aperture, the focal length of the camera, the shape and intensity of the light source.[91]/nIn his work he explains the inversion of the image in the camera obscura,[92] the fact that the image is similar to the source when the hole is small, but also the fact that the image can differ from the source when the hole is large. All these results are produced by using a point analysis of the image.[93]/nIn the seventh tract of his book of optics, Alhazen described an apparatus for experimenting with various cases of refraction, in order to investigate the relations between the angle of incidence, the angle of refraction and the angle of deflection. This apparatus was a modified version of an apparatus used by Ptolemy for similar purpose.[94][95][96]/nAlhazen basically states the concept of unconscious inference in his discussion of colour before adding that the inferential step between sensing colour and differentiating it is shorter than the time taken between sensing and any other visible characteristic (aside from light), and that \"time is so short as not to be clearly apparent to the beholder.\" Naturally, this suggests that the colour and form are perceived elsewhere. Alhazen goes on to say that information must travel to the central nerve cavity for processing and:/nthe sentient organ does not sense the forms that reach it from the visible objects until \nafter it has been affected by these forms; thus it does not sense color as color or light as light until after it has been affected by the form of color or light. Now the affectation received by the sentient organ from the form of color or of light is a certain change; and change must take place in time; \u2026..and it is in the time during which the form extends from the sentient organ's surface to the cavity of the common nerve, and in (the time) following that, that the sensitive faculty, which exists in the whole of the sentient body will perceive color as color\u2026Thus the last sentient's perception of color as such and of light as such takes place at a time following that in which the form arrives from the surface of the sentient organ to the cavity of the common nerve.[97]/nAlhazen explained color constancy by observing that the light reflected from an object is modified by the object's color. He explained that the quality of the light and the color of the object are mixed, and the visual system separates light and color. In Book II, Chapter 3 he writes:/nAgain the light does not travel from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the color, nor does the form of the color pass from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the light. Neither the form of the light nor that of the color existing in the colored object can pass except as mingled together and the last sentient can only \nperceive them as mingled together. Nevertheless, the sentient perceives that the visible object is luminous and that the light seen in the object is other than the color and that these are two properties.[98]/nThe Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.[99] He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.[100]/nSudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of experimental psychology, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusions.[101] Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the \"founder of psychophysics\", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.[101] Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.[102]/nAlhazen offered an explanation of the Moon illusion, an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.[103] Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by Roger Bacon, John Pecham and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.[104] Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. Cleomedes (c. 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to Posidonius (c. 135\u201350 BCE).[105] Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his Optics, but the text is obscure.[106] Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit./nTherefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and ... attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency./nAn aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (i'tibar)(Arabic: \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0631) and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries.  Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (ilm tabi'i) with mathematics (ta'alim; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in Kitab al-Manazir (The Optics; De aspectibus or Perspectivae)[107] and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).[108]/nAccording to Matthias Schramm,[109] Alhazen \"was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.\"[110] G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,[111] partly because at the time (1964) the Book of Optics had not yet been fully translated from Arabic, and Toomer was concerned that without context, specific passages might be read anachronistically. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.[111] Toomer concluded his review by saying that it would not be possible to assess Schramm's claim that Ibn al-Haytham was the true founder of modern physics without translating more of Alhazen's work and fully investigating his influence on later medieval writers.[112]/nBesides the Book of Optics, Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his Risala fi l-Daw' (Treatise on Light). He investigated the properties of luminance, the rainbow, eclipses, twilight, and moonlight. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on catoptrics.[113]/nAlhazen discussed the physics of the celestial region in his Epitome of Astronomy, arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses\u2014in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred Ptolemaic model \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the laws of physics\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.[114]/nHe also wrote Maqala fi daw al-qamar (On the Light of the Moon)./nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body.[113] In his Treatise on Place, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[115]/n/nIn his On the Configuration of the World Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:/nThe earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.[116]/nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's Almagest, which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as Georg von Peuerbach[117] during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance.[118]/nIn his Al-Shuk\u016bk \u201bal\u0101 Batlamy\u016bs, variously translated as Doubts Concerning Ptolemy or Aporias against Ptolemy, published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized Ptolemy's Almagest, Planetary Hypotheses, and Optics, pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's Almagest concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the Hypotheses concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.[119] He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the equant, failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:[120]/nPtolemy assumed an arrangement (hay'a) that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.[121]/nHaving pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.[119] In the Doubts Concerning Ptolemy Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:/nTruth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...[67]/nHe held that the criticism of existing theories\u2014which dominated this book\u2014holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge./nAlhazen's The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets was written c. 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his Doubts on Ptolemy, Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of epicycles to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's equant. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.[122]/nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as Exact Determination of the Meridian, a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the Milky Way; Alhazen made the first systematic effort of evaluating the Milky Way's parallax, combining Ptolemy's data and his own. He concluded that the parallax is (probably very much) smaller than Lunar parallax, and the Milky way should be a celestial object. Though he was not the first who argued that the Milky Way does not belong to the atmosphere, he is the first who did quantitative analysis for the claim.[123]\nThe fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the Doubts and Model of the Motions discussed above.[124]/nIn mathematics, Alhazen built on the mathematical works of Euclid and Thabit ibn Qurra and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry\".[125]/nHe developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.[126]/nAlhazen explored what is now known as the Euclidean parallel postulate, the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements, using a proof by contradiction,[127] and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.[128] He formulated the Lambert quadrilateral, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the \"Ibn al-Haytham\u2013Lambert quadrilateral\".[129] He was criticised by Omar Khayyam who pointed that Aristotle had condemned the use of motion in geometry.[130]/nIn elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.[131] The two lunes formed from a right triangle by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the lunes of Alhazen; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.[132]/nAlhazen's contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers. In his Analysis and Synthesis, he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2n\u22121(2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) where 2n\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 is prime, but he was not able to prove this result; Euler later proved it in the 18th century, and it is now called the Euclid\u2013Euler theorem.[131]/nAlhazen solved problems involving congruences using what is now called Wilson's theorem. In his Opuscula, Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the Chinese remainder theorem.[131]/nAlhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a paraboloid. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.[133]/nAlhazen also wrote a Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals, although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace./nIn engineering, one account of his career as a civil engineer has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, to regulate the flooding of the Nile River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual inundation of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a dam, at the site of the modern-day Aswan Dam. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon feigned madness so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.[134]/nIn his Treatise on Place, Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle's view that nature abhors a void, and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place (al-makan) is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.[115] Abd-el-latif, a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in Fi al-Radd 'ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan (A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place) for its geometrization of place.[115]/nAlhazen also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his Book of Optics. In \"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for\ncorrelation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.\"[135] Alhazen came up with many theories that shattered what was known of reality at the time. These ideas of optics and perspective did not just tie into physical science, rather existential philosophy. This led to religious viewpoints being upheld to the point that there is an observer and their perspective, which in this case is reality.[40]/nAlhazen was a Muslim and most sources report that he was a Sunni and a follower of the Ash'ari school.[136][137][138][139] Ziauddin Sardar says that some of the greatest Muslim scientists, such as Ibn al-Haytham and Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, who were pioneers of the scientific method, were themselves followers of the Ash\u02bfari school of Islamic theology.[138] Like other Ash\u02bfarites who believed that faith or taqlid should apply only to Islam and not to any ancient Hellenistic authorities,[140] Ibn al-Haytham's view that taqlid should apply only to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his scientific skepticism and criticism against Ptolemy and other ancient authorities in his Doubts Concerning Ptolemy and Book of Optics.[141]/nAlhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.[142]\nHe also wrote a treatise entitled Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation in which he discussed finding the Qibla, where prayers (salat) are directed towards, mathematically.[143]/nThere are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works, e.g.\nin  Doubts Concerning Ptolemy:/nTruth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...[144]/nIn The Winding Motion:/nFrom the statements made by the noble Shaykh, it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (taqlid); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.[145]/nRegarding the relation of objective truth and God:/nI constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.[146]/nAlhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment./nHis main work, Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics), was known in the Muslim world mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by Kam\u0101l al-D\u012bn al-F\u0101ris\u012b, the Tanq\u012b\u1e25 al-Man\u0101\u1e93ir li-dhaw\u012b l-ab\u1e63\u0101r wa l-ba\u1e63\u0101'ir.[147] In al-Andalus, it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the Banu Hud dynasty of Zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text, al-Mu'taman ibn H\u016bd. A Latin translation of the Kitab al-Manazir was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.[148] This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: Roger Bacon,[149] Robert Grosseteste,[150] Witelo, Giambattista della Porta,[151] Leonardo da Vinci,[152] Galileo Galilei,[153] Christiaan Huygens,[154] Ren\u00e9 Descartes,[155] and Johannes Kepler.[156] Meanwhile, in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced Averroes' writings on optics,[citation needed] and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his Optics by Persian scientist Kamal al-Din al-Farisi (died c. 1320) in the latter's Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of [Ibn al-Haytham's] Optics).[108] Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on cosmology were translated into Latin, Hebrew and other languages./nAlthough only one commentary on Alhazen's optics has survived the Islamic Middle Ages, Geoffrey Chaucer mentions the work in The Canterbury Tales:[157]/n\"They spoke of Alhazen and Vitello,\nAnd Aristotle, who wrote, in their lives,\nOn strange mirrors and optical instruments.\"/nThe impact crater Alhazen on the Moon is named in his honour,[158] as was the asteroid 59239 Alhazen.[159] In honour of Alhazen, the Aga Khan University (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as \"The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology\".[160] Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-dinar banknote issued in 2003,[161] and on 10-dinar notes from 1982./nThe 2015 International Year of Light celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.[162]/nIn 2014, the \"Hiding in the Light\" episode of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, presented by Neil deGrasse Tyson, focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by Alfred Molina in the episode./nOver forty years previously, Jacob Bronowski presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), The Ascent of Man. In episode 5 (The Music of the Spheres), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was \"the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced\", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz./nH.

A Neoplatonist, he was the son of the philosophers Hermias and Aedesia, the brother of Heliodorus of Alexandria and the grandson of Syrianus.[2] Ammonius was a pupil of Proclus in Roman Athens, and taught at Alexandria for most of his life, having obtained a public chair in the 470s./nAccording to Olympiodorus of Thebes's Commentaries on Plato's Gorgias and Phaedo texts, Ammonius gave lectures on the works of Plato, Aristotle, and Porphyry of Tyre,[2] and wrote commentaries on Aristotelian works and three lost commentaries on Platonic texts.[2] He is also the author of a text on the astrolabe published in the Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum, and lectured on astronomy and geometry.[2] Ammonius taught numerous Neoplatonists, including Damascius, Olympiodorus of Thebes, John Philoponus, Simplicius of Cilicia, and Asclepius of Tralles.[2] Also among his pupils were the physician Gessius of Petra and the ecclesiastical historian Zacharias Rhetor, who became the bishop of Mytilene.[2]/nAs part of the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, the Alexandrian school was investigated by the Roman imperial authorities; Ammonius made a compromise with the Patriarch of Alexandria, Peter III, voluntarily limiting his teaching in return for keeping his own position.[2] This alienated a number of his colleagues and pupils, including Damascius, who nonetheless called him \"the greatest commentator who ever lived\" in his own Life of Isidore of Alexandria.[2]/nAmmonius' father Hermias died when he was a child, and his mother Aedesia raised him and his brother Heliodorus in Alexandria. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to Athens where they studied under Proclus. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in the city, lectured on Plato and Aristotle for the rest of his life. According to Damascius, during the persecution of the pagans at Alexandria in the late 480s, Ammonius made concessions to the Christian authorities so that he could continue his lectures.[3] Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; Olympiodorus heard him lecture on Plato's Gorgias in that year.[4] He was also an accomplished astronomer; he lectured on Ptolemy and is known to have written a treatise on the astrolabe./nOf his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's De Interpretatione survives intact. A commentary on Porphyry's Isagoge may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations./nIn De Interpretatione, Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like Boethius in his second Commentary and in The Consolation of Philosophy, this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites Iamblichus, who said \"knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known.\"[5][6]/nIn addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive:/nThere is Greek-language work called Life of Aristotle, which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but \"is more probable that it is the work of Joannes Philoponus, the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some MSS.\"[7]", "58885820": "Mary Shore Walker (1882\u20131952) was the first woman faculty member at the University of Missouri, and taught in the department of Mathematics.[1]/nShe was born in 1882.

He was bishop of Halberstadt from 1366 until his death./nAlbert was born at Rickensdorf near Helmstedt, the son of a farmer in a small village; but because of his talent, he was sent to study at the University of Prague and the University of Paris./nAt Paris, he became a master of arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the College of Sorbonne, although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was rector of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of Pope Urban V in Avignon as an envoy of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, in order to negotiate the founding of the University of Vienna. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector of this University in 1365./nIn 1366, Albert was elected bishop of Halberstadt (counted as Albert III), Halberstadt being the diocese in which he was born. As Bishop of Halberstadt, he allied himself with Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, against Gerhard of Berg, Bishop of Hildesheim, and was taken prisoner by Gerhard in the battle of Dinckler in 1367./nHe died at Halberstadt in 1390./nAlbert was a pupil of Jean Buridan[1] and was very much influenced by Buridan's teachings on physics and logic. As a natural philosopher, he contributed to the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout Italy and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined critical analysis of language with epistemological pragmatism. Albert distinguishes, as his teacher did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible \u201cin the common course of nature\u201d and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God's absolute power. Albert refused to extend the reference of a physical term to supernatural, purely imaginary possibilities.[clarification needed] Later regarded as one of the principal adherents of nominalism, along with his near contemporaries at Paris, namely Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen, whose works are often so similar as to be confused with each other. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert's work made him a better-known figure in some areas than more important contemporaries like Buridan and Nicole Oresme./nAlbert's work in logic also shows strong influence by William of Ockham, whose commentaries on the logica vetus (i.\u00a0e. on Porphyry, and Aristotle's Categoriae and De interpretatione) were made the subject of a series of works called Quaestiones by Albert./nAlbert of Saxony's teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The theory of impetus introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of John Philoponus.[3]/nThis theory was a precursor to the modern theory of inertia./nAlthough Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert's Perutilis logica (c. 1360) was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham's conception of the nature of a sign. Albert believed that signification rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign. Albert followed Ockham in his conception of universals and in his theory of supposition. Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham's notion of simple supposition, understood as the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of categories and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of substance and quality. Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination. Albert's treatment of relation was highly original. Although, like Ockham, he refused to construe relations as things distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other. He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way./nAlbert's voluminous collection of Sophismata (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of syncategorematic terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the propositions in which they occur. In his Sophismata, he followed William Heytesbury. In his analysis of epistemic verbs or of infinity, Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its terms: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a \"mode of a thing\". Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining truth and in dealing with \u201cinsolubles\u201d or paradoxes of self-reference. In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false./nAlbert also authored commentaries on Ars Vetus, a set of twenty-five Quaestiones logicales (c. 1356) that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and Quaestiones on the Posterior Analytics. Albert explored in a series of disputed questions the status of logic and semantics, as well as the theory of reference and truth. Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of terminist logic in central Europe. Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his Perutilis Logica. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of logical deduction./nBut it was his commentary on Aristotle's Physics that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert's Physics basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition to Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of Heytesbury and John Dumbleton. His commentary on Aristotle's De caelo was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan's commentary on this text. Blasius of Parma read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His Treatise on Proportions was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of Thomas Bradwardine and Oresme, it influenced the application of the theory of proportions to motion./nAlbert's commentaries on the Nicomachean Ethics and the Economics also survive (both unedited), as well as several short mathematical texts, most notably Tractatus proportionum (c. 1353). Although Albert studied theology in Paris, no theological writing survived./nAlbert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan's teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert's own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. He knew how to construct proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.", "59049665": "Heather A.

He deduced a correct explanation for eclipses and described the Sun as a fiery mass larger than the Peloponnese, as well as attempting to explain rainbows and meteors./nAnaxagoras was born in the town of Clazomenae in the early 5th century BCE,[1] where he may have been born into an aristocratic family.[2][1] He arrived at Athens, either shortly after the Persian war (in which he may have fought on the Persian side),[3] or at some point when he was a bit older, around 456 BCE.[1] While at Athens, he became close with the Athenian statesman Pericles.[1] According to Diogenes, La\u00ebrtius and Plutarch, in later life he was charged with impiety and went into exile in Lampsacus; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with Pericles, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.[4] According to La\u00ebrtius, Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial[a], c.\u2009450. Even so, Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to Lampsacus in Troad (c.\u2009434\u00a0\u2013 433). He died there around the year 428. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory and observed the anniversary of his death for many years. They placed over his grave the following inscription:/nHere Anaxagoras, who in his quest of truth scaled heaven itself, is laid to rest.[b][c]/nResponding to the claims of Parmenides on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, \"each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it\".[5] He introduced the concept of nous (cosmic mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated the original mixture, which was homogeneous or nearly so./nAnaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from Ionia to Athens. According to Anaxagoras, all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass but in a confused and indistinguishable form.[6] There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts (\u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u1fc6) as well as heterogeneous ones.[6][7]/nThe work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike, and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of Mind or Reason (\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling all life forms.[d] Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion. It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts. [6]/nDecrease and growth represent a new aggregation (\u03c3\u1f50\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) and disruption (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2). However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome.[6] Each thing contains parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character.[8] Out of this process arise the things we see in this world.[8]/nPlutarch[e] says \"Anaxagoras is said to have predicted that if the heavenly bodies should be loosened by some slip or shake, one of them might be torn away, and might plunge and fall to earth.\"/nHis observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of meteorites led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to the prediction of the impact of meteorites. According to Pliny[f], he was credited with predicting the fall of the meteorite in 467.[9] He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the Sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the Moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones.[g] He thought that the Earth was flat and floated supported by 'strong' air under it, and that disturbances in this air sometimes caused earthquakes.[h] He introduced the notion of panspermia, that life exists throughout the universe and could be distributed everywhere.[10][11]/nHe attempted to give a scientific account of eclipses, meteors, rainbows, and the Sun, which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the Peloponnese; he also said that the Moon had mountains, and he believed that it was inhabited. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the Earth and ignited by rapid rotation.[6] His theories about eclipses, the Sun, and Moon may well have been based on observations of the eclipse of 463 BCE[i], which was visible in Greece./nAnaxagoras was one of the first to claim that the moon reflected sunlight and did not produce light by itself, we know that through a fragment of one of his writings translated as \u201cthe sun induces the moon with brightness\u201d[12]/nAccording to Plutarch in his work On exile, Anaxagoras is the first Greek to attempt the problem of squaring the circle, a problem he worked on while in prison.[j]/nAnaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in the work of Simplicius of Cilicia in the 6th century AD.[k]/nAnaxagoras' book was reportedly available for a drachma in the Athenian marketplace.[1] It was certainly known to Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, based on the contents of their surviving plays,[1] and possibly to Aeschylus as well, based on the testimony of Seneca.[1] However, although Anaxagoras almost certainly lived in Athens during the lifetime of Socrates (born 470 BCE), there is no evidence that they ever met. In the Phaedo, Plato portrays Socrates saying of Anaxagoras as a young man: 'I eagerly acquired his books and read them as quickly as I could'. However, Socrates goes on to describe his later disillusionment with his philosophy.[l] Anaxagoras is also mentioned by Socrates during his trial in Plato's Apology./nHe is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow). It reads: \"Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself?\"/nThe Roman author Valerius Maximus preserves a different tradition; Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: \"If this had not perished, I would have\"\u2014a sentence described by Valerius as being \"possessed of sought-after wisdom\".[13][m]/nDante Alighieri places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his Divine Comedy (Inferno, Canto IV, line 137)./nChapter 5 in Book II of De Docta Ignorantia (1440) by Nicholas of Cusa is dedicated to the truth of the sentence \"Each thing is in each thing\" which he attributes to Anaxagoras./nAnaxagoras appears as a character in the second Act of Faust, Part II by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe./nIn the Diels-Kranz numbering for testimony and fragments of Pre-Socratic philosophy, Anaxagoras is catalogued as number 59./nThe most recent edition of this catalogue is Diels, Hermann; Kranz, Walther (1957).

Beginning in 9th grade, Paulson took four years of Latin and math while her sisters took short hand as Paulson did not want to be a secretary. After attending Ohio State University for one year, Paulson's sister, who was already working in Pasadena at the time, convinced her mother to move to Pasadena as well.[4] In 1947 the family moved to Pasadena, California, where her career at JPL would begin.[3]/nIn 1959 Barbara married Harry Murray Paulson in Pasadena where they lived until 1962 before moving to Monrovia.

The rocket exploded shortly after liftoff.[4] On January 31, 1958.,[2] Paulson was assigned to the operations center for Explorer-1, the first satellite of the United States, launched during the Space Race with the Soviet Union.[2] Paulson did the work with minimal equipment: a mechanical pencil, light table, and graph paper.[6] The multi-stage launch that Paulson aided in calculations for allowed the Corporal could carry a warhead over 200 miles.[7]/nIn 1960, when Paulson was 32 years old, she and her husband Harry were expecting their first child. When Paulson requested a closer parking space at work because she was pregnant, she was forced to quit as JPL did not employ pregnant women at the time and keeping a pregnant women on staff would result in insurance policy problems.[4][8] JPL had no maternity leave, so women who were fired or forced to quit their positions did not have jobs to return to after giving birth.[5] Paulson's supervisor, Helen Ling, worked hard to rehire women who'd been forced out with no parental leave, so in 1961, when her daughter was seven months old, Paulson accepted Ling's offer and returned to the lab.[2] Paulson notably did not apply for a better parking spot when she got pregnant for the second time.[1] At one point during Paulson's early years at JPL a beauty contest was held amongst the other female human computers. Paulson came in third place and the queen of the contest was called 'Miss Guided Missile'.[4][9]/nIn the 1960s, with JPL's reputation cemented in the success of Explorer-1, JPL began to set its sights on the moon and other interplanetary exploration missions. Paulson and her colleague Helen Ling worked overtime to calculate trajectories of the Mariner probes that would later be sent to Venus and Mars.[7] Paulson and her colleagues determined that only brief timeframes and launch opportunities existed that allowed for the ideal transit from Earth to its target.[4] In the late 1960s Paulson was given title of engineer and eventually became a supervisor in the lab.[10]/nIn the 1970s Paulson later went on to play a vital role in the Viking program, the first lander to reach the surface of mars.

He invented, in particular, a system allowing several telephone signals to pass through telegraph cables. The generalization of the Van Rysselberghe System (French: Syst\u00e8me Van Rysselberghe) in Belgium in 1884, and then abroad, promoted the development of this new mode of communication, making it a pioneer of long-distance telephone communications./nFran\u00e7ois Van Rysselbergh was born into a modest Ghent family, his father, Jean-Baptiste Van Rysselberghe, was a carpenter,[1] he had married another Ghent woman, M\u00e9lanie Rommens. The couple would have nine children, three of whom died at a young age.[1] Fran\u00e7ois was the eldest of the siblings.[2] The family first settled in Turnhout, where Fran\u00e7ois received his primary education. The family then returned to Ghent.[3] After completing his secondary studies before the age of 17 at the Sint-Barbaracollege,[4] he was forced to work to financially support his family and then accepted a post of supervisor of a boarding school, first in Ninove first and then in Tournai. He then accepted a course load in a private school in Ghent. Although his basic education was literary, he was interested in science and particularly in mathematics and physics[4] and took courses at the industrial school.[2] In 1865[2] he successfully passed an examination for the post of second professor of mathematics at the Ostend navigation school, where he gave courses in nautical astronomy and mathematics.[5] While he was teaching there, he was a candidate in physical sciences and mathematics at the University of Li\u00e8ge and graduated in 1869.[4][2] The same year, he married Henriette Housmans in Ostend. The couple, established in Ostend, would have seven children./nFran\u00e7ois Van Rysselberghe developed a passion for meteorology at that time. He soon acquired a whole arsenal of measuring devices. He then planned to invent a combined device that would automatically annotate weather data on a single metal cylinder. He designed and produced, assisted by his collaborator[6]  Th\u00e9odore Schubart,[7] a meteorograph equipped with an electro-magnetic recorder which would remain known under the name of Universal Meteorograph Van Rysselberghe and Schubart (French: M\u00e9t\u00e9orographe universel Van Rysselberghe et Schubart). The prototype functioned without fail for several years in the tower of the town hall of Ostend. The device was acquired by foreign meteorologists and was presented at the International Geographic Congress held in Paris in 1875, which earned it a gold medal and the academic palms.[7][6]/nThe same year, Fran\u00e7ois Van Rysselberghe joined the State hydrographic service as a sub-engineer of the Hydrographic Service of the Navy. He worked there for a while and helped to map the sandbanks of the Belgian coast and the mouths of the Scheldt.[6] At this time, he also developed a tide gauge[7] but in 1876, Jean-Charles Houzeau, director of the Royal Observatory of Belgium, called on him to attach him to the weather forecast service.[8]/nOn 26 September 1876, the Observatory published the first Meteorological Bulletin in its history. Fran\u00e7ois Van Rysselberghe was one of the first to observe the impact of oceanic and polar currents on climate change. He studied isallobaric routes and changes to his daily predictions, perhaps the first to have done this.[8] He was one of the first synopticians in the same rank as Robert FitzRoy. He attacked the theories of Heinrich Wilhelm Dove of which he said: \"It is important that we get rid of this conception which has not solved the problem of the storms of Europe, to adopt a theory which is better in harmony with the observation.\"[8]/nA great limitation of the weather models he could build was related to the fact that at that time, meteorologists could only count on a single 40-point reading in Europe and transmitted at eight in the morning local time. This only allowed for a single daily card to be drawn up at best. Fran\u00e7ois Van Rysselberghe then began to think about an automatic process for transmitting data in real time, which he called international telemeteorography (French: t\u00e9l\u00e9m\u00e9t\u00e9orographie internationale). He therefore restarted his meteorographer, which soon became operational between Brussels and Ostend. In 1881, the device was at the center of a masterful demonstration in Paris, during the International Congress of Electricians which took place on the occasion of the International Exposition of Electricity when the astonished observed, engraved in Paris, the meteorological observations of Brussels.[9]/nVan Rysselberghe was always in search of the factors influencing the climatic conditions, and was then interested in the high layers of the atmosphere and planned to send there via a kite or a balloon a telemeteorograph. He also designed a network of 29 international stations interconnected with nine recording stations, making it possible to pool meteorological data instantly. These projects would only remain theoretical as his discoveries led Van Rysselberghe to tackle other related issues: long-distance telephony.[9]/nVan Rysselberghe had difficulty contacting the operator of the telemeteorograph based in Ostend. This device was linked with that of Brussels via a dedicated telegraph cable, hence the idea which occurred to him to investigate whether the same cable could not transmit both telegraph and telephone signals. This would be at the origin of his most important contribution to the deployment of long-distance telephony by developing an anti-inductor system which made it possible to dispense with having to pull new telephone cables between two geographically distant points since the signal borrowed the existing telegraph cabling. In France, a first link was established on the basis of this process between Reims and Paris then, in 1882 between Brussels and Paris, which greatly contributed to the notoriety of the Van Rysselberghe System (French: Syst\u00e8me Van Rysselberghe).[9] In 1884, the entire Belgian inter-urban network thus became operational on this base.[10]/nIn 1882, Van Rysselberghe accepted a course load at the special schools of the Ghent University and taught the course in the application of electricity. He then left the Royal Observatory of Belgium to turn resolutely towards telecommunications. In 1883, he designed a multiplex phonic telegraph that could simultaneously transmit up to 24 messages. The device received the full attention of the United States.[10]/nIn 1884, having donated his Van Rysselberghe System to Belgium, he was appointed, as a reward, electrician-consultant to the Ministry of Railways, Posts and Telegraphs.[11][5] Shortly before his untimely death, Van Rysselberghe became interested in the transport of electricity made more difficult by the fact that the current at that time was direct.[10] He filed a patent for his transport of energy in water pipes under high pressure coupled to dynamos.[12] The city of Antwerp gave him carte blanche to deploy his invention to power the city's public lighting and it is when he was busy with this task that he died on 3 February 1893,[13] at the age of 46,[14] carried away in two days by a devastating disease.[13]/nHe is buried in the Schoonselhof cemetery in Antwerp./nVan Rysselberghe was the brother of Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe who married Maria, n\u00e9e Monnom. Maria was Andr\u00e9 Gide's confidante and her daughter, Elisabeth Van Rysselberghe, gave birth to a child, Catherine Gide, the author's only child, who was recognized in April 1938 after the death of Gide's wife.[15]", "44926697": "Michelle Lynn Wachs is an American mathematician who specializes in algebraic combinatorics and works as a professor of mathematics at the University of Miami.[1]/nWachs and her advisor Adriano Garsia are the namesakes of  the Garsia\u2013Wachs algorithm for optimal binary search trees, which they published in 1977.[2][A]\nShe is also known for her research on shellings for simplicial complexes,[F] partially ordered sets,[C] and Coxeter groups,[B] and on random permutation statistics[E] and set partition statistics.[D]/nWachs earned her doctorate in 1977 from the University of California, San Diego, under the supervision of Adriano Garsia.

As a teen, George Jr., known then as \"Ted\", would deliver milk and used his salary to start a newspaper at the high school, where he also played football. His higher education took place at the University of Iowa, where he was a football player, a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and editor of The Daily Iowan, an independent newspaper which serves the university campus. He earned his B.A. in 1923, his M.A. in 1925 and his Ph.D. in 1928.[1]/nHe then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he served as head of the Department of Journalism at Drake University until 1931. That year, he moved to Evanston, Illinois, as a professor of journalism and advertising at Northwestern University. The next year, he moved to New York City to join the advertising agency of Young and Rubicam as director of research (later serving as vice president from 1937 to 1947). He was also a professor of journalism at Columbia University, but he had to give up this position shortly after he formed his own polling company, the American Institute of Public Opinion (Gallup Poll), in 1935.[2]/nGallup is often credited as the developer of public polling. In 1932, Gallup did some polling for his mother-in-law, Ola Babcock Miller, a candidate who was a long shot from winning a position as Iowa Secretary of State. With the Democratic landslide of that year, she won a stunning victory, furthering Gallup's interest in politics.[3]/nIn 1936, his new organization achieved national recognition by correctly predicting, from the replies of only 50,000 respondents, that Franklin Roosevelt would defeat Alf Landon in the U.S. Presidential election. This was in direct contradiction to the widely-respected Literary Digest magazine whose poll based on over two million returned questionnaires predicted that Landon would be the winner. Not only did Gallup get the election right, he correctly predicted the results of the Literary Digest poll, as well as using a random sample smaller than theirs but chosen to match it./nTwelve years later, his organization had its moment of greatest ignominy, when it predicted that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry S. Truman in the 1948 election, by between 5% and 15%; Truman won the election by 4.5%. Gallup believed the error was mostly due to his decision to end polling three weeks before Election Day, thus failing to account for Truman's comeback./nIn 1947, he launched the Gallup International Association, an international association of polling organizations.[4] With friends-cum-rivals Elmo Roper and Archibald Crossley, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Market Research Council, the National Council on Public Polls, and the American Association for Public Opinion Research.[5] In 1948, with Claude E. Robinson, he founded Gallup & Robinson, an advertising research company./nIn 1958, Gallup grouped all of his polling operations under what became The Gallup Organization./nGallup died in 1984 of a heart attack at his summer home in Tschingel ob Gunten, a village in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland.

Educated in the capital cities of Luoyang and Chang'an, he achieved success as an astronomer, mathematician, seismologist, hydraulic engineer, inventor, geographer, cartographer, ethnographer, artist, poet, philosopher, politician, and literary scholar./nZhang Heng began his career as a minor civil servant in Nanyang. Eventually, he became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stance on historical and calendrical issues led to his becoming a controversial figure, preventing him from rising to the status of Grand Historian. His political rivalry with the palace eunuchs during the reign of Emperor Shun (r.\u00a0125\u2013144) led to his decision to retire from the central court to serve as an administrator of Hejian Kingdom in present-day Hebei. Zhang returned home to Nanyang for a short time, before being recalled to serve in the capital once more in 138. He died there a year later, in 139./nZhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered armillary sphere to assist astronomical observation;[1] improved the inflow water clock by adding another tank;[2] and invented the world's first seismoscope, which discerned the cardinal direction of an earthquake 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) away.[1][3][4] He improved previous Chinese calculations for pi. In addition to documenting about 2,500 stars in his extensive star catalog, Zhang also posited theories about the Moon and its relationship to the Sun: specifically, he discussed the Moon's sphericity, its illumination by reflected sunlight on one side and the hidden nature of the other, and the nature of solar and lunar eclipses. His fu (rhapsody) and shi poetry were renowned in his time and studied and analyzed by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity; some modern scholars have compared his work in astronomy to that of the Greco-Roman Ptolemy (AD\u00a086\u2013161)./nBorn in the town of Xi'e in Nanyang Commandery (north of the modern Nanyang City in Henan province), Zhang Heng came from a distinguished but not affluent family.[5][6][7] His grandfather Zhang Kan (\u5f35\u582a) had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the Han by Emperor Guangwu (r.\u00a025\u201357), following the death of the usurping Wang Mang of the Xin (AD\u00a09\u201323).[5][8][9][10] When he was ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother.[9]/nAn accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang.[5] While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a hot spring near Mount Li and dedicated one of his earliest fu poems to it.[11] This work, entitled \"Fu on the Hot Springs\" (W\u0113nqu\u00e1n f\u00f9 \u6eab\u6cc9\u8ce6), describes the throngs of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the \"Huaqing Hot Springs\", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine Yang Guifei during the Tang dynasty.[12] After studying for some years at Luoyang's Taixue, he was well-versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher Cui Yuan (78\u2013143), the official and philosophical commentator Ma Rong (79\u2013166), and the philosopher Wang Fu (78\u2013163).[5][7] Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the Imperial Secretaries, yet he acted modestly and declined.[5][11]/nAt age 23, Zhang returned home with the title \"Officer of Merit in Nanyang\", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor Bao De (in office from 103 to 111).[5][7][8] As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents.[8] As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office.[13] He spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi'e.[5][8][11] Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of 30 and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics.[8]/nIn 112, Zhang was summoned to the court of Emperor An (r.\u00a0106\u2013125), who had heard of his expertise in mathematics.[8] When he was nominated to serve at the capital, Zhang was escorted by carriage\u2014a symbol of his official status\u2014to Luoyang, where he became a court gentleman working for the Imperial Secretariat.[5][8] He was promoted to Chief Astronomer for the court, serving his first term from 115 to 120 under Emperor An and his second under the succeeding emperor from 126 to 132.[8] As Chief Astronomer, Zhang was a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies, one of Nine Ministers ranked just below the Three Excellencies.[14] In addition to recording heavenly observations and portents, preparing the calendar, and reporting which days were auspicious and which ill-omened, Zhang was also in charge of an advanced literacy test for all candidates to the Imperial Secretariat and the Censorate, both of whose members were required to know at least 9,000 characters and all major writing styles.[14][15] Under Emperor An, Zhang also served as Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages under the Ministry of Guards, in charge of receiving memorials to the throne (formal essays on policy and administration) as well as nominees for official appointments.[16][17]/nWhen the government official Dan Song proposed the Chinese calendar should be reformed in 123 to adopt certain apocryphal teachings, Zhang opposed the idea. He considered the teachings to be of questionable stature and believed they could introduce errors.[5] Others shared Zhang's opinion and the calendar was not altered, yet Zhang's proposal that apocryphal writings should be banned was rejected.[5] The officials Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu, members of a committee to compile the dynastic history Dongguan Hanji (\u6771\u89c0\u6f22\u8a18), sought permission from the court to consult Zhang Heng.[5] However, Zhang was barred from assisting the committee due to his controversial views on apocrypha and his objection to the relegation of the Gengshi Emperor's (r.\u00a023\u201325) role in the restoration of the Han dynasty as lesser than Emperor Guangwu's.[20][21] Liu Zhen and Liu Taotu were Zhang's only historian allies at court, and after their deaths Zhang had no further opportunities for promotion to the prestigious post of court historian.[20]/nDespite this setback in his official career, Zhang was reappointed as Chief Astronomer in 126 after Emperor Shun of Han (r. 125\u2013144) ascended to the throne.[18][22] His intensive astronomical work was rewarded only with the rank and salary of 600\u00a0bushels, or shi, of grain (mostly commuted to coin cash or bolts of silk).[18][23] To place this number in context, in a hierarchy of twenty official ranks, the lowest-paid official earned the rank and salary of 100\u00a0bushels and the highest-paid official earned 10,000\u00a0bushels during the Han.[24] The 600-bushel rank was the lowest the emperor could directly appoint to a central government position; any official of lower status was overseen by central or provincial officials of high rank.[25]/nIn 132, Zhang introduced an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal direction of a distant earthquake.[26] On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device,[26] until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400\u00a0km (248\u00a0mi) to 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.[26][27][28][29]/nA year after Zhang presented his seismoscope to the court, officials and candidates were asked to provide comments about a series of recent earthquakes which could be interpreted as signs of displeasure from Heaven.[18] The ancient Chinese viewed natural calamities as cosmological punishments for misdeeds that were perpetrated by the Chinese ruler or his subordinates on earth. In Zhang's memorial discussing the reasons behind these natural disasters, he criticized the new recruitment system of Zuo Xiong which fixed the age of eligible candidates for the title \"Filial and Incorrupt\" at age forty.[18] The new system also transferred the power of the candidates' assessment to the Three Excellencies rather than the Generals of the Household, who by tradition oversaw the affairs of court gentlemen.[18] Although Zhang's memorial was rejected, his status was significantly elevated soon after to Palace Attendant, a position he used to influence the decisions of Emperor Shun.[17][18] With this prestigious new position, Zhang earned a salary of 2,000\u00a0bushels and had the right to escort the emperor.[30]/nAs Palace Attendant to Emperor Shun, Zhang Heng attempted to convince him that the court eunuchs represented a threat to the imperial court. Zhang pointed to specific examples of past court intrigues involving eunuchs, and convinced Shun that he should assume greater authority and limit their influence.[18] The eunuchs attempted to slander Zhang, who responded with a fu rhapsody called \"Fu on Pondering the Mystery\", which vents his frustration.[12] Rafe de Crespigny states that Zhang's rhapsody used imagery similar to Qu Yuan's (340\u2013278\u00a0BC) poem \"Li Sao\" and focused on whether or not good men should flee the corrupted world or remain virtuous within it.[18][31]/nWhile working for the central court, Zhang Heng had access to a variety of written materials located in the Archives of the Eastern Pavilion.[33] Zhang read many of the great works of history in his day and claimed he had found ten instances where the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian (145\u201390\u00a0BC) and the Book of Han by Ban Gu (AD\u00a032\u201392) differed from other ancient texts that were available to him.[5][34] His account was preserved and recorded in the 5th-century text of the Book of Later Han by Fan Ye (398\u2013445).[34] His rhapsodies and other literary works displayed a deep knowledge of classic texts, Chinese philosophy, and histories.[5] He also compiled a commentary on the Taixuan (\u592a\u7384, \"Great Mystery\") by the Daoist author Yang Xiong (53\u00a0BC\u2013AD\u00a018).[7][8][18]/nXiao Tong (501\u2013531), a crown prince of the Liang dynasty (502\u2013557), immortalized several of Zhang's works in his literary anthology Selections of Refined Literature (Wen xuan \u6587\u9078). Zhang's fu rhapsodies include \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" (X\u012b j\u012bng f\u00f9 \u897f\u4eac\u8ce6), \"Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody\" (D\u014dng j\u012bng f\u00f9 \u6771\u4eac\u8ce6), \"Southern Capital Rhapsody\" (N\u00e1n d\u016b f\u00f9 \u5357\u90fd\u8ce6), \"Rhapsody on Contemplating the Mystery\" (S\u012b xu\u00e1n f\u00f9 \u601d\u7384\u8ce6), and \"Rhapsody on Returning to the Fields\" (Gu\u012b ti\u00e1n f\u00f9 \u6b78\u7530\u8ce6).[35] The latter fuses Daoist ideas with Confucianism and was a precursor to later Chinese metaphysical nature poetry, according to Liu Wu-chi.[36] A set of four short lyric poems (shi \u8a69) entitled \"Lyric Poems on Four Sorrows\" (S\u00ec ch\u00f3u sh\u012b \u56db\u6101\u8a69), is also included with Zhang's preface. This set constitutes some of the earliest heptasyllabic shi Chinese poetry written.[37][38] While still in Luoyang, Zhang became inspired to write his \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" and \"Eastern Metropolis Rhapsody\", which were based on the \"Rhapsody on the Two Capitals\" by the historian Ban Gu.[5] Zhang's work was similar to Ban's, although the latter fully praised the contemporaneous Eastern Han regime while Zhang provided a warning that it could suffer the same fate as the Western Han if it too declined into a state of decadence and moral depravity.[5] These two works satirized and criticized what he saw as the excessive luxury of the upper classes.[11] Zhang's \"Southern Capital Rhapsody\" commemorated his home city of Nanyang, home of the restorer of the Han dynasty, Guangwu.[5]/nIn Zhang Heng's poem \"Four Sorrows\", he laments that he is unable to woo a beautiful woman due to the impediment of mountains, snows and rivers.[8][18] Scholars Rafe de Crespigny and David R. Knechtges claim that Zhang wrote this as an innuendo hinting at his inability to keep in contact with the emperor, hindered by unworthy rivals and petty men.[8][18] This poem is one of the first in China to have seven words per line.[37] His \"Four Sorrows\" reads:/n\u6211\u6240\u601d\u516e\u5728\u592a\u5c71\n\u6b32\u5f80\u5f9e\u4e4b\u6a11\u7236\u8271\n\u5074\u8eab\u6771\u671b\u6d95\u6cbe\u7ff0\n\u7f8e\u4eba\u8d08\u6211\u91d1\u932f\u5200\n\u4f55\u4ee5\u5831\u4e4b\u82f1\u74ca\u7464\n\u8def\u9060\u83ab\u81f4\u501a\u900d\u9059\n\u4f55\u7232\u61f7\u6182\u5fc3\u7169\u52de/nIn Taishan stays my dear sweetheart,\nBut Liangfu keeps us long apart;\nLooking east, I find tears start.\nShe gives me a sword to my delight;\nA jade I give her as requite.\nI'm at a loss as she is out of sight;\nWhy should I trouble myself all night?/nIn another poem of his called \"Stabilizing the Passions\" (D\u00ecng q\u00edng f\u00f9 \u5b9a\u60c5\u8ce6)\u2014preserved in a Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) encyclopedia, but referred to earlier by Tao Qian (365\u2013427) in praise of Zhang's lyrical minimalism\u2014Zhang displays his admiration for an attractive and exemplary woman.[39] This simpler type of fu poem influenced later works by the prominent official and scholar Cai Yong (132\u2013192).[37] Zhang wrote:/n\u592b\u4f55\u5996\u5973\u4e4b\u6dd1\u9e97\n\u5149\u83ef\u8c54\u800c\u79c0\u5bb9\n\u65b7\u7576\u6642\u800c\u5448\u7f8e\n\u51a0\u670b\u5339\u800c\u7121\u96d9/nAh, the chaste beauty of this alluring woman!\nShe shines with flowery charms and blooming face.\nShe is unique among all her contemporaries.\nShe is without a peer among her comrades./nZhang's long lyrical poems also revealed a great amount of information on urban layout and basic geography. His rhapsody \"Sir Based-On-Nothing\" provides details on terrain, palaces, hunting parks, markets, and prominent buildings of Chang'an, the Western Han capital.[11][35] Exemplifying his attention to detail, his rhapsody on Nanyang described gardens filled with spring garlic, summer bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.[40] Zhang Heng's writing confirms the size of the imperial hunting park in the suburbs of Chang'an, as his estimate for the circumference of the park's encircling wall agrees with the historian Ban Gu's estimate of roughly 400\u00a0li (one li in Han times was equal to 415.8\u00a0m, or 1,364\u00a0ft, making the circumference of the park wall 166,320\u00a0m, or 545,600\u00a0ft).[41] Along with Sima Xiangru (179\u2013117\u00a0BC), Zhang listed a variety of animals and hunting game inhabiting the park, which were divided in the northern and southern portions of the park according to where the animals had originally come from: northern or southern China.[42] Somewhat similar to the description of Sima Xiangru, Zhang described the Western Han emperors and their entourage enjoying boat outings, water plays, fishing, and displays of archery targeting birds and other animals with stringed arrows from the tops of tall towers along Chang'an's Kunming Lake.[43] The focus of Zhang's writing on specific places and their terrain, society, people, and their customs could also be seen as early attempts of ethnographic categorization.[44] In his poem \"Xijing fu\", Zhang shows that he was aware of the new foreign religion of Buddhism, introduced via the Silk Road, as well as the legend of the birth of Buddha with the vision of the white elephant bringing about conception.[45] In his \"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\" (\u897f\u4eac\u8ce6), Zhang described court entertainments such as juedi (\u89d2\u62b5), a form of theatrical wrestling accompanied by music in which participants butted heads with bull horn masks.[46]/nWith his \"Responding to Criticism\" (Ying jian \u61c9\u9593), a work modeled on Yang Xiong's \"Justification Against Ridicule\",[47] Zhang was an early writer and proponent of the Chinese literary genre shelun, or hypothetical discourse. Authors of this genre created a written dialogue between themselves and an imaginary person (or a real person of their entourage or association); the latter poses questions to the author on how to lead a successful life.[48] He also used it as a means to criticize himself for failing to obtain high office, but coming to the conclusion that the true gentleman displays virtue instead of greed for power.[18] In this work, Dominik Declercq asserts that the person urging Zhang to advance his career in a time of government corruption most likely represented the eunuchs or Empress Liang's (116\u2013150) powerful relatives in the Liang clan.[22] Declercq states that these two groups would have been \"anxious to know whether this famous scholar could be lured over to their side\", but Zhang flatly rejected such an alignment by declaring in this politically charged piece of literature that his gentlemanly quest for virtue trumped any desire of his for power.[49]/nZhang wrote about the various love affairs of emperors dissatisfied with the imperial harem, going out into the city incognito to seek out prostitutes and sing-song girls. This was seen as a general criticism of the Eastern Han emperors and their imperial favorites, guised in the criticism of earlier Western Han emperors.[50] Besides criticizing the Western Han emperors for lavish decadence, Zhang also pointed out that their behavior and ceremonies did not properly conform with the Chinese cyclical beliefs in yin and yang.[51] In a poem criticizing the previous Western Han dynasty, Zhang wrote:/n\u5f97\u4e4b\u8005\u5f37\uff0c\n\u64da\u4e4b\u8005\u4e45\u3002\n\u6d41\u9577\u5247\u96e3\u7aed\uff0c\n\u67e2\u6df1\u5247\u96e3\u673d\u3002\n\u6545\u5962\u6cf0\u8086\u60c5\uff0c\n\u99a8\u70c8\u5f4c\u8302\u3002/nThose who won this territory were strong;\nThose who depended on it endured.\nWhen a stream is long, its water is not easily exhausted.\nWhen roots are deep, they do not rot easily.\nTherefore, as extravagance and ostentation were given free rein,\nThe odor became pungent and increasingly fulsome./nFor centuries the Chinese approximated pi as 3; Liu Xin (d. AD\u00a023) made the first known Chinese attempt at a more accurate calculation of 3.1457,[52] but there is no record detailing the method he used to obtain this figure.[53][54] In his work around 130,[55] Zhang Heng compared the celestial circle to the diameter of the earth, proportioning the former as 736 and the latter as 232, thus calculating pi as 3.1724.[56] In Zhang's day, the ratio 4:3 was given for the area of a square to the area of its inscribed circle and the volume of a cube and volume of the inscribed sphere should also be 42:32.[56] In formula, with D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {9}{16}}}\n\nD3; Zhang realized that the value for diameter in this formula was inaccurate, noting the discrepancy as the value taken for the ratio.[54][56] Zhang then attempted to remedy this by amending the formula with an additional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{16}}}\n\nD3, hence V=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {9}{16}}}\n\nD3 + \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{16}}}\n\nD3 = \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {5}{8}}}\n\nD3.[56] With the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the implied ratio of the area of the square to the circle is \u221a8:\u221a5.[56][57] From this formula, Zhang calculated pi as the square root of 10 (or approximately 3.162).[17][18][56][57][58] Zhang also calculated pi as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n730\n232\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {730}{232}}}\n\n = 3.1466 in his book Ling Xian (\u9748\u61b2).[59] In the 3rd\u00a0century, Liu Hui made the calculation more accurate with his \u03c0 algorithm, which allowed him to obtain the value 3.14159.[60] Later, Zu Chongzhi (429\u2013500) approximated pi as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n355\n113\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {355}{113}}}\n\n or 3.141592, the most accurate calculation for pi the ancient Chinese would achieve.[61]/nIn his publication of AD\u00a0120 called The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (\u9748\u61b2, Ling Xian, lit. \"Sublime Model\"),[18][62] Zhang Heng theorized that the universe was like an egg \"as round as a crossbow pellet\" with the stars on the shell and the Earth as the central yolk.[4][63] This universe theory is congruent with the geocentric model as opposed to the heliocentric model. Although the ancient Warring States (403\u2013221 BC) Chinese astronomers Shi Shen and Gan De had compiled China's first star catalogue in the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, Zhang nonetheless catalogued 2,500 stars which he placed in a \"brightly shining\" category (the Chinese estimated the total to be 14,000), and he recognized 124\u00a0constellations.[18][63] In comparison, this star catalogue featured many more stars than the 850 documented by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190\u2013c.\u2009120\u00a0BC) in his catalogue, and more than Ptolemy (AD\u00a083\u2013161), who catalogued over 1,000.[64] Zhang supported the \"radiating influence\" theory to explain solar and lunar eclipses, a theory which was opposed by Wang Chong (AD\u00a027\u201397).[65] In the Ling Xian, Zhang wrote:/n\u592b\u65e5\u8b6c\u7336\u706b\uff0c\u6708\u8b6c\u7336\u6c34\uff0c\u706b\u5247\u5916\u5149\uff0c\u6c34\u5247\u542b\u666f\u3002\u6545\u6708\u5149\u751f\u65bc\u65e5\u4e4b\u6240\u7167\uff0c\u9b44\u751f\u65bc\u65e5\u4e4b\u6240\u853d\uff0c\u7576\u65e5\u5247\u5149\u76c8\uff0c\u5c31\u65e5\u5247\u5149\u76e1\u4e5f\u3002\nThe Sun is like fire and the Moon like water.  The fire gives out light and the water reflects it. Thus the Moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the Sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark.\n\n\u8846\u661f\u88ab\u71ff\uff0c\u56e0\u6c34\u8f49\u5149\u3002\u7576\u65e5\u4e4b\u885d\uff0c\u5149\u5e38\u4e0d\u5408\u8005\uff0c\u853d\u65bc\u5730\u4e5f\u3002\u662f\u8b02\u95c7\u865b\u3002\u5728\u661f\u661f\u5fae\uff0c\u6708\u904e\u5247\u98df\u3002\nThe planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the Moon owing to the obstruction of the Earth itself\u2014this is called \"\u00e0nx\u016b\", a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we call it) an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) then there is a solar eclipse./nZhang Heng viewed these astronomical phenomena in supernatural terms as well. The signs of comets, eclipses, and movements of heavenly bodies could all be interpreted by him as heavenly guides on how to conduct affairs of state.[18] Contemporary writers also wrote about eclipses and the sphericity of heavenly bodies. The music theorist and mathematician Jing Fang (78\u201337\u00a0BC) wrote about the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon while discussing eclipses:/nThe Moon and the planets are Yin; they have shape but no light. This they receive only when the Sun illuminates them. The former masters regarded the Sun as round like a crossbow bullet, and they thought the Moon had the nature of a mirror. Some of them recognized the Moon as a ball too. Those parts of the Moon which the Sun illuminates look bright, those parts which it does not, remain dark.[67]/nThe theory posited by Zhang and Jing was supported by later pre-modern scientists such as Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095), who expanded on the reasoning of why the Sun and Moon were spherical.[68] The theory of the celestial sphere surrounding a flat, square Earth was later criticized by the Jin-dynasty scholar-official Yu Xi (fl. 307\u2013345). He suggested that the Earth could be round like the heavens, a spherical Earth theory fully accepted by mathematician Li Ye (1192\u20131279) but not by mainstream Chinese science until European influence in the 17th century.[69]/nThe outflow clepsydra was a timekeeping device used in China as long ago as the Shang dynasty (c.\u00a01600\u2013c.\u00a01050\u00a0BC), and certainly by the Zhou dynasty (1122\u2013256\u00a0BC).[70] The inflow clepsydra with an indicator rod on a float had been known in China since the beginning of the Han dynasty in 202\u00a0BC and had replaced the outflow type.[70] The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled.[70] Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.[2][18] Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the indicator rod with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right.[71] Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours.[71] Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year.[72] Zhang mentioned a \"jade dragon's neck\", which in later times meant a siphon.[73] He wrote of the floats and indicator-rods of the inflow clepsydra as follows:/n\u4ee5\u9285\u70ba\u5668\uff0c\u518d\u758a\u5dee\u7f6e\uff0c\u5be6\u4ee5\u6e05\u6c34\uff0c\u4e0b\u5404\u958b\u5b54\uff0c\u4ee5\u7389\u866f\u5410\u6f0f\u6c34\u5165\u5169\u58fa\u3002\u53f3\u70ba\u591c\uff0c\u5de6\u70ba\u665d\u3002\nBronze vessels are made and placed one above the other at different levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small opening in the form of a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day.\n\n\u84cb\u4e0a\u53c8\u9444\u91d1\u9285\u4ed9\u4eba\uff0c\u5c45\u5de6\u58fa\uff1b\u70ba\u80e5\u5f92\uff0c\u5c45\u53f3\u58fa\u3002\u7686\u4ee5\u5de6\u624b\u62b1\u7bad\uff0c\u53f3\u624b\u6307\u523b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5225\u5929\u6642\u65e9\u665a\u3002\nOn the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.[73]/nZhang Heng is the first person known to have applied hydraulic motive power (i.e. by employing a waterwheel and clepsydra) to rotate an armillary sphere, an astronomical instrument representing the celestial sphere.[74][75][76] The Greek astronomer Eratosthenes (276\u2013194\u00a0BC) invented the first armillary sphere in 255\u00a0BC. The Chinese armillary sphere was fully developed by 52\u00a0BC, with the astronomer Geng Shouchang's addition of a permanently fixed equatorial ring.[77] In AD 84 the astronomers Fu An and Jia Kui added the ecliptic ring, and finally Zhang Heng added the horizon and meridian rings.[18][77] This invention is described and attributed to Zhang in quotations by Hsu Chen and Li Shan, referencing his book Lou Shui Chuan Hun Thien I Chieh (Apparatus for Rotating an Armillary Sphere by Clepsydra Water). It was likely not an actual book by Zhang, but a chapter from his Hun I or Hun I Thu Chu, written in 117 AD.[78] His water-powered armillary influenced the design of later Chinese water clocks and led to the discovery of the escapement mechanism by the 8th\u00a0century.[79] The historian Joseph Needham (1900\u20131995) states:/nWhat were the factors leading to the first escapement clock in China? The chief tradition leading to Yi Xing (AD 725\u00a0) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes by means of a water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.[79]/nZhang did not initiate the Chinese tradition of hydraulic engineering, which began during the mid Zhou dynasty (c.\u00a06th\u00a0century\u00a0BC), through the work of engineers such as Sunshu Ao and Ximen Bao.[80] Zhang's contemporary, Du Shi, (d.\u00a0AD\u00a038) was the first to apply the motive power of waterwheels to operate the bellows of a blast furnace to make pig iron, and the cupola furnace to make cast iron.[81][82] Zhang provided a valuable description of his water-powered armillary sphere in the treatise of 125, stating:/nThe equatorial ring goes around the belly of the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.[83]/nZhang Heng's water-powered armillary sphere had profound effects on Chinese astronomy and mechanical engineering in later generations. His model and its complex use of gears greatly influenced the water-powered instruments of later astronomers such as Yi Xing (683\u2013727), Zhang Sixun (fl.\u00a010th\u00a0century), Su Song (1020\u20131101), Guo Shoujing (1231\u20131316), and many others. Water-powered armillary spheres in the tradition of Zhang Heng's were used in the eras of the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013280) and Jin dynasty (266\u2013420), yet the design for it was temporarily out of use between 317 and 418, due to invasions of northern Xiongnu nomads.[84] Zhang Heng's old instruments were recovered in 418, when Emperor Wu of Liu Song (r.\u00a0420\u2013422) captured the ancient capital of Chang'an. Although still intact, the graduation marks and the representations of the stars, Moon, Sun, and planets were quite worn down by time and rust.[84] In 436, the emperor ordered Qian Luozhi, the Secretary of the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar, to recreate Zhang's device, which he managed to do successfully.[84] Qian's water-powered celestial globe was still in use at the time of the Liang dynasty (502\u2013557), and successive models of water-powered armillary spheres were designed in subsequent dynasties.[84]/nFrom the earliest times, the Chinese were concerned with the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91\u00a0BC that in 780\u00a0BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers.[85] It was not known at the time that earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty.[85] These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram.[86] There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.\u00a0500\u2013428\u00a0BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460\u2013370\u00a0BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.\u00a0585\u2013c.\u00a0525\u00a0BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384\u2013322\u00a0BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.[86]/nDuring the Han dynasty, many learned scholars\u2014including Zhang Heng\u2014believed in the \"oracles of the winds\".[87] These oracles of the occult observed the direction, force, and timing of the winds, to speculate about the operation of the cosmos and to predict events on Earth.[88] These ideas influenced Zhang Heng's views on the cause of earthquakes./nIn 132, Zhang Heng presented to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions.[89] It was named \"earthquake weathervane\" (h\u00f2uf\u0113ng d\u00ecd\u00f2ngy\u00ed \u5019\u98a8\u5730\u52d5\u5100),[90] and it was able to roughly determine the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from.[18][75] According to the Book of Later Han (compiled by Fan Ye in the 5th\u00a0century), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away.[91][92] This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this type of natural disaster.[3][93][94] The Book of Later Han records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had felt any seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern Gansu Province), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.[95]/nTo indicate the direction of a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose.[96] His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery.[97] When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head.[97] His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum.[97] Wang Zhenduo (\u738b\u632f\u9438) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.[98]/nLater Chinese of subsequent periods were able to reinvent Zhang's seismoscope. They included the 6th-century mathematician and surveyor Xindu Fang of the Northern Qi dynasty (550\u2013577) and the astronomer and mathematician Lin Xiaogong of the Sui dynasty (581\u2013618).[99] Like Zhang, Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong were given imperial patronage for their services in craftsmanship of devices for the court.[100] By the time of the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368), it was acknowledged that all devices previously made were preserved, except for that of the seismoscope.[101] This was discussed by the scholar Zhou Mi around 1290, who remarked that the books of Xindu Fang and Lin Xiaogong detailing their seismological devices were no longer to be found.[101] Horwitz, Kreitner, and Needham speculate if Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) era seismographs found their way to contemporary Japan; according to Needham, \"instruments of apparently traditional type there in which a pendulum carries pins projecting in many directions and able to pierce a surrounding paper cylinder, have been described.\"[102]/nHong-sen Yan states that modern replicas of Zhang's device have failed to reach the level of accuracy and sensitivity described in Chinese historical records.[103] Wang Zhenduo presented two different models of the seismoscope based on the ancient descriptions of Zhang's device.[104] In his 1936 reconstruction, the central pillar (du zhu) of the device was a suspended pendulum acting as a movement sensor, while the central pillar of his second model in 1963 was an inverted pendulum.[104] According to Needham, while working in the Seismological Observatory of Tokyo University in 1939, Akitsune Imamura and Hagiwara made a reconstruction of Zhang's device.[98][105] While it was John Milne and Wang Zhenduo who argued early on that Zhang's \"central pillar\" was a suspended pendulum, Imamura was the first to propose an inverted model.[106] He argued that transverse shock would have rendered Wang's immobilization mechanism ineffective, as it would not have prevented further motion that could knock other balls out of their position.[98] On June 13, 2005, modern Chinese seismologists announced that they had successfully created a replica of the instrument.[107]/nAnthony J. Barbieri-Low, a professor of early Chinese history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, names Zhang Heng as one of several high-ranking Eastern-Han officials who engaged in crafts that were traditionally reserved for artisans (gong \u5de5), such as mechanical engineering.[108] Barbieri-Low speculates that Zhang only designed his seismoscope, but did not actually craft the device himself. He asserts that this would most likely have been the job of artisans commissioned by Zhang.[109] He writes: \"Zhang Heng was an official of moderately high rank and could not be seen sweating in the foundries with the gong artisans and the government slaves. Most likely, he worked collaboratively with the professional casters and mold makers in the imperial workshops.\"[109]/nThe Wei (220\u2013265) and Jin dynasty (266\u2013420) cartographer and official Pei Xiu (224\u2013271) was the first in China to describe in full the geometric grid reference for maps that allowed for precise measurements using a graduated scale, as well as topographical elevation.[110][111] However, map-making in China had existed since at least the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC with the Qin state maps found in Gansu in 1986.[112] Pinpointed accuracy of the winding courses of rivers and familiarity with scaled distance had been known since the Qin and Han dynasty, respectively, as evidenced by their existing maps, while the use of a rectangular grid had been known in China since the Han as well.[113][114] Historian Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of Zhang Heng's work in cartography are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng.[115] Rafe de Crespigny asserts that it was Zhang who established the rectangular grid system in Chinese cartography.[18] Needham points out that the title of his book Flying Bird Calendar may have been a mistake, and that the book is more accurately entitled Bird's Eye Map.[116] Historian Florian C. Reiter notes that Zhang's narrative \"Guitian fu\" contains a phrase about applauding the maps and documents of Confucius of the Zhou dynasty, which Reiter suggests places maps (tu) on a same level of importance with documents (shu).[117] It is documented that a physical geography map was first presented by Zhang Heng in 116 AD, called a Ti Hsing Thu.[118]/nZhang Heng is often credited with inventing the first odometer,[17][63] an achievement also attributed to Archimedes (c.\u00a0287\u2013212\u00a0BC) and Heron of Alexandria (fl.\u00a0AD\u00a010\u201370). Similar devices were used by the Roman and Han-Chinese empires at about the same period. By the 3rd\u00a0century, the Chinese had termed the device the jili guche (\u8a18\u91cc\u9f13\u8eca, \"li-recording drum carriage\" (the modern measurement of li\u00a0=\u00a0500\u00a0m/1640\u00a0ft).[119]/nAncient Chinese texts describe the mechanical carriage's functions; after one li was traversed, a mechanically driven wooden figure struck a drum, and after ten li had been covered, another wooden figure struck a gong or a bell with its mechanically operated arm.[119] However, there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han dynasty China that centered on the \"huang men\"\u2014court people (i.e. eunuchs, palace officials, attendants and familiars, actors, acrobats, etc.) who followed the musical procession of the royal \"drum-chariot\".[120] There is speculation that at some time during the 1st\u00a0century\u00a0BC the beating of drums and gongs was mechanically driven by the rotation of the road wheels.[120] This might have actually been the design of Luoxia Hong (c.\u00a0110\u00a0BC), yet by at least 125 the mechanical odometer carriage was already known, as it was depicted in a mural of the Xiao Tang Shan Tomb.[120]/nThe south-pointing chariot was another mechanical device credited to Zhang Heng.[17] It was a non-magnetic compass vehicle in the form of a two-wheeled chariot. Differential gears driven by the chariot's wheels allowed a wooden figurine (in the shape of a Chinese state minister) to constantly point to the south, hence its name. The Song Shu (c.\u00a0AD 500\u00a0) records that Zhang Heng re-invented it from a model used in the Zhou dynasty era, but the violent collapse of the Han dynasty unfortunately did not allow it to be preserved. Whether Zhang Heng invented it or not, Ma Jun (200\u2013265) succeeded in creating the chariot in the following century.[121]/nZhang Heng's mechanical inventions influenced later Chinese inventors such as Yi Xing, Zhang Sixun, Su Song, and Guo Shoujing.

Ewing at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo, commented in 1886 on Zhang Heng's contributions to seismology.[125][126] The historian Joseph Needham emphasized his contributions to pre-modern Chinese technology, stating that Zhang was noted even in his day for being able to \"make three wheels rotate as if they were one.\"[127] More than one scholar has described Zhang as a polymath.[7][29][38][94] However, some scholars also point out that Zhang's writing lacks concrete scientific theories.[122] Comparing Zhang with his contemporary, Ptolemy (83\u2013161) of Roman Egypt, Jin Guantao, Fan Hongye, and Liu Qingfeng state:/nZhang's poetry was widely read during his life and after his death. In addition to the compilation of Xiao Tong mentioned above, the Eastern Wu official Xue Zong (d. 237) wrote commentary on Zhang's poems \"Dongjing fu\" and \"Xijing fu\".[128] The influential poet Tao Qian wrote that he admired the poetry of Zhang Heng for its \"curbing extravagant diction and aiming at simplicity\", in regards to perceived tranquility and rectitude correlating with the simple but effective language of the poet.[129] Tao wrote that both Zhang Heng and Cai Yong \"avoided inflated language, aiming chiefly at simplicity\", and adding that their \"compositions begin by giving free expression to their fancies but end on a note of quiet, serving admirably to restrain undisciplined and passionate nature\".[130]/nZhang was given great honors in life and in death. The philosopher and poet Fu Xuan (217\u2013278) of the Wei and Jin dynasties once lamented in an essay over the fact that Zhang Heng was never placed in the Ministry of Works. Writing highly of Zhang and the 3rd-century mechanical engineer Ma Jun, Fu Xuan wrote, \"Neither of them was ever an official of the Ministry of Works, and their ingenuity did not benefit the world. When (authorities) employ personnel with no regard to special talent, and having heard of genius neglect even to test it\u2014is this not hateful and disastrous?\"[131]/nIn honor of Zhang's achievements in science and technology, his friend Cui Ziyu (Cui Yuan) wrote a memorial inscription on his burial stele, which has been preserved in the Guwen yuan.[8] Cui stated, \"[Zhang Heng's] mathematical computations exhausted (the riddles of) the heavens and the earth. His inventions were comparable even to those of the Author of Change. The excellence of his talent and the splendour of his art were one with those of the gods.\"[132] The minor official Xiahou Zhan (243\u2013291) of the Wei dynasty made an inscription for his own commemorative stele to be placed at Zhang Heng's tomb.

Then, he went to Istanbul to study in the military college and then the naval academy. After completing his education with honours, he was appointed  teacher of mathematics at the naval academy, and later at  Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka High School, one of the most prominent schools in Istanbul.

He was appointed the mathematical chair at the University of Angers in 1681. A revised and expanded edition, titled Nouveaux El\u00e9mens des math\u00e9matiques, was published in 1689.[9] This edition included some early work on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.[1]", "38373121": "Arnold Dresden (1882\u20131954) was a Dutch-American mathematician, known for his work in the calculus of variations and collegiate mathematics education.[1][2] He was a president of the Mathematical Association of America and a member of the American Philosophical Society.[3][4]/nDresden was born in Amsterdam on November 23, 1882, into a wealthy banking family.

In addition, he published Would-Be Worlds in 1996, a volume on computer simulation and the way it promises to change the way scientific exploration is conducted./nMeanwhile, Dr. Casti has also written three popular volumes on mathematics: Five Golden Rules: Great Theories of 20th-Century Mathematics---and Why They Matter, a sequel, Five More Golden Rules, and Mathematical Mountaintops: The Five Most Famous Problems of All Time, published and later recalled by Oxford University Press. In 1992, he published Reality Rules, a two-volume text on mathematical modeling. As a matter of fact, Casti's contributions to mathematical writing have garnered accolades. In 1989, his written work Alternate Realities: Mathematical Models of Nature and Man was awarded a prize by the Association of American Publishers in a competition among all scholarly books published in mathematics and the natural sciences.[2]/nIn recent years, Casti has shifted his literary focus to science fiction. In 1998 he published The Cambridge Quintet, a volume of scientific fiction involving Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alan Turing, J. B. S. Haldane, C. P. Snow and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in a fictional dinner-party conversation centered about the question of the uniqueness of human cognition and the possibility of thinking machines. More recently, his published books include Art & Complexity, a volume edited with A. Karlqvist, as well as a short volume on the life of Kurt G\u00f6del published in 2003 titled G\u00f6del: A Life of Logic. In the same year he published the volume, The One, True, Platonic Heaven, which addresses in a fictional format the question of the limits to scientific knowledge. The volume on art and complexity sparked off a continuing interest in the interrelationship between complex systems and artistic forms of all types, which is reflected in a set of papers currently in preparation addressing the complexity of scientific theories regarded as artistic forms./nIn other literary pursuits, he published a neo-noir thriller entitled Prey for Me in 2020./nIn 2002, Casti's newest book, Mathematical Mountaintops, was recalled by Oxford University Press due to \"rampant plagiarism\".[3] According to the New York Times, in the book, Casti had \"lifted\" passages and images from mathematicians and writers such as Thomas Callister Hales, William Dunham, Barry Arthur Cipra, and Simon Singh[4]/nIn another incident two years later, Casti retracted one of his articles, \"Losing games for your winning play\", that had been published in the journal Complexity.[5] In the retraction notice, Casti admitted that it had been \"... plagiarized in its entirety from the article by Erica Klarreich, 'Playing Both Sides' in the January/February issue of The Sciences.\"[6] Casti apologized to Klarreich, as well as to Paul Davies, for plagiarizing their work.[7]/nAs a mathematician and researcher, Casti received his Ph.D. under Richard Bellman at the University of Southern California.

One thread has been exploration of the relationship between the social \"mood\" of a population and its biasing effect on actions and behaviors. In this direction, his 2010 book, Mood Matters: From Rising Skirt Lengths to the Collapse of World Powers, addresses the directions and patterns of social causation and their implications for future trends and collective social events, such as styles in popular culture, the outcome of political processes, and even the rise and fall of civilizations.

The famous mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the Cauchy family.[5]/nOn Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the \u00c9cole Centrale du Panth\u00e9on, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802.[7] Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique./nIn 1805, he placed second of 293 applicants on this exam and was admitted.[7] One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he completed the course in 1807, at age\u00a018, and went on to the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors./nAfter finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and was assigned the Ourcq Canal project and the Saint-Cloud Bridge project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg.[7] Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the Premi\u00e8re Classe (First Class) of the Institut de France.[b] Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected./nIn September 1812, now 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming ill from overwork.[7] Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose not to return to Cherbourg.[7] Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave; he spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand. The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816; Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction of Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance of his membership in the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles./nIn November 1815, Louis Poinsot, who was an associate professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of Fermat's polygonal number theorem. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; Cauchy was promoted to full professor./nWhen Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Alo\u00efse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works.[9] Alo\u00efse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.[10]/nThe conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more conservative brother Charles X. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross-appointments at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and the Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Paris\u00a0[fr]./nIn July 1830, the July Revolution occurred in France. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king Louis-Philippe (of the House of Orl\u00e9ans). Riots, in which uniformed students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris./nThese events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind.[11] He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832\u20131833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[12]/nIn August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux, Henri d'Artois (1820\u20131883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X.[13] As a professor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.\nDuring his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. Cauchy's role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838.[11] Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store./nIn 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile./nCauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838.[11] He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance./nIn August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes. This Bureau bore some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could \"forget about\" the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position at sea \u2014 mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position at sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences./nIn November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the position of being elected but not approved; accordingly, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot./nThroughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of church and state. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the \u00c9cole Normale \u00c9ccl\u00e9siastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues, who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but received just three of 45 votes./nThe year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Facult\u00e9 de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon III./nNot unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the university until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4\u00a0a.m. on 23 May 1857.[11]/nHis name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower./nThe genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius\u2014describing a circle touching three given circles\u2014which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of Euler's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics. In the theory of series he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.[5]/nIn the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.  He also contributed research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter.[14] He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced a 3 \u00d7 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor.[15] In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of Sim\u00e9on Poisson.[5]/nOther significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat polygonal number theorem./nCauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as Cauchy's integral theorem, was the following:/nwhere f(z) is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve C (contour) lying in the complex plane. The contour integral is taken along the contour C. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (then still called \"First Class of the Institute\") on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825.[16] The 1825 paper is seen by many[by whom?] as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics./nIn 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.[17] This concept concerns functions that have poles\u2014isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function f(z) can be expanded in the neighborhood  of a singularity a as/nwhere \u03c6(z) is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then f is said to have a pole of order n in the point a. If n = 1, the pole is called simple.\nThe coefficient B1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function f at a. If f is non-singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a. Clearly, the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to/nwhere we replaced B1 by the modern notation of the residue./nIn 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first[18] he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy's integral formula,/nwhere f(z) is analytic on C and within the region bounded by the contour C and the complex number a is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at z = a. In the second paper[19] he presented the residue theorem,/nwhere the sum is over all the n poles of f(z) on and within the contour C. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with Pierre Alphonse Laurent being the first mathematician besides Cauchy to make a substantial contribution (his work on what are now known as Laurent series, published in 1843)./nIn his book Cours d'Analyse Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. Rigor in this case meant the rejection of the principle of Generality of algebra (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals.[20] Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was \"the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe\".[21]  The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and \n\n\n\n\u03b4\n\u2212\n\u03f5\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\delta -\\epsilon }\n\n arguments were introduced into calculus.  Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself./nM. Barany claims that the \u00c9cole mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement.[22]  Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to Analyse Alg\u00e9brique was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus.[23] Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853./nCauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of \"infinitesimally small quantities\", arguing they lead from everything from the usual \"epsilontic\" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used.[24]/nHe was the first to prove Taylor's theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder.[5] He wrote a textbook[25] (see the illustration) for his students at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.[26] In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods;[27] thus one of his theorems was exposed to a \"counter-example\" by Abel, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity./nIn a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the \"Principle of the argument\" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering./nCauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to Leonhard Euler. It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes:/nHis greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises:/nHis other works include:/nAugustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution. Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis Fran\u00e7ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in Rouen says:[28]/nWe never had more than a one-half pound (230\u00a0g) of bread \u2014 and sometimes not even that. This we supplement with little supply of hard crackers and rice that we are allotted. Otherwise, we are getting along quite well, which is the important thing and goes to show that human beings can get by with little. I should tell you that for my children's pap I still have a bit of fine flour, made from wheat that I grew on my own land. I had three bushels, and I also have a few pounds of potato starch. It is as white as snow and very good, too, especially for very young children. It, too, was grown on my own land.[29]/nIn any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X./nHe was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.[30] He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Great Famine of Ireland./nHis royalism and religious zeal made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\"[31] and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean-Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong.", "1844": "Archimedes of Syracuse (/\u02cc\u0251\u02d0rk\u026a\u02c8mi\u02d0di\u02d0z/, ARK-ihm-EE-deez;[2][a] c.\u2009287\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009212\u00a0BC) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily.[3] Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time,[4] Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems.[5][6] These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.[7][8]/nArchimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi, defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, working on statics and hydrostatics. Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever,[9] the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity,[10] and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy or Archimedes' principle.[11] He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion./nArchimedes died during the siege of Syracuse, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his mathematical discoveries./nUnlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c.\u2009530\u00a0AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes by Eutocius in the 6th century opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance and again in the 17th century,[12][13] while the discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.[14][15][16][17]/nArchimedes was born c.\u2009287 BC in the seaport city of Syracuse, Sicily, at that time a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia. The date of birth is based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek historian John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years before his death in 212 BC.[8] In the Sand-Reckoner, Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an astronomer about whom nothing else is known.[18] A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides, but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children, or if he ever visited Alexandria, Egypt, during his youth.[19] From his surviving written works, it is clear that he maintained collegiate relations with scholars based there, including his friend Conon of Samos and the head librarian Eratosthenes of Cyrene.[b]/nThe standard versions of Archimedes' life were written long after his death by Greek and Roman historians. The earliest reference to Archimedes occurs in The Histories by Polybius (c. 200\u2013118 BC), written about 70 years after his death. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city from the Romans.[20] Polybius remarks how, during the Second Punic War, Syracuse switched allegiances from Rome to Carthage, resulting in a military campaign under the command of Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who besieged the city from 213 to 212 BC. He notes that the Romans underestimated Syracuse's defenses, and mentions several machines Archimedes designed, including improved catapults, crane-like machines that could be swung around in an arc, and other stone-throwers. Although the Romans ultimately captured the city, they suffered considerable losses due to Archimedes' inventiveness.[21]/nCicero (106\u201343 BC) mentions Archimedes in some of his works. While serving as a quaestor in Sicily, Cicero found what was presumed to be Archimedes' tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. The tomb carried a sculpture illustrating Archimedes' favorite mathematical proof, that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two-thirds that of an enclosing cylinder including its bases.[22][23] He also mentions that Marcellus brought to Rome two planetariums Archimedes built.[24] The Roman historian Livy (59 BC\u201317 AD) retells Polybius' story of the capture of Syracuse and Archimedes' role in it.[20]/nPlutarch (45\u2013119 AD) wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II, the ruler of Syracuse.[26] He also provides at least two accounts on how Archimedes died after the city was taken. According to the most popular account, Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet Marcellus, but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. This enraged the soldier, who killed Archimedes with his sword. Another story has Archimedes carrying mathematical instruments before being killed because a soldier thought they were valuable items. Marcellus was reportedly angered by Archimedes' death, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset (he called Archimedes \"a geometrical Briareus\") and had ordered that he should not be harmed.[27][28]/nThe last words attributed to Archimedes are \"Do not disturb my circles\" (Latin, \"Noli turbare circulos meos\"; Katharevousa Greek, \"\u03bc\u1f74 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\"), a reference to the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. There is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in Plutarch's account. A similar quotation is found in the work of Valerius Maximus (fl. 30 AD), who wrote in Memorable Doings and Sayings, \"... sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare'\" (\"... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this'\").[20]/nThe most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II of Syracuse, who supplied the pure gold to be used. The crown was likely made in the shape of a votive wreath.[29] Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the goldsmith without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density.[30]/nIn this account, Archimedes noticed while taking a bath that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the golden crown's volume. Archimedes was so excited by this discovery that he took to the streets naked, having forgotten to dress, crying \"Eureka!\" (Greek: \"\u03b5\u1f55\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1, he\u00far\u0113ka!, lit.\u2009'I have found [it]!'). For practical purposes water is incompressible,[31] so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, its density could be obtained; if cheaper and less dense metals had been added, the density would be lower than that of gold. Archimedes found that this is what had happened, proving that silver had been mixed in.[29][30]/nThe story of the golden crown does not appear anywhere in Archimedes' known works. The practicality of the method described has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy that would be required to measure water displacement.[32] Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the hydrostatics principle known as Archimedes' principle, found in his treatise On Floating Bodies: a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.[33] Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the crown to that of pure gold by balancing it on a scale with a pure gold reference sample of the same weight, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly.[11] Galileo Galilei, who invented a hydrostatic balance in 1586 inspired by Archimedes' work, considered it \"probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself.\"[34][35]/nWhile Archimedes did not invent the lever, he gave a mathematical proof of the principle involved in his work On the Equilibrium of Planes.[36] Earlier descriptions of the principle of the lever are found in a work by Euclid and in the Mechanical Problems, belonging to the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle, the authorship of which has been attributed by some to Archytas.[37][38]/nThere are several, often conflicting, reports regarding Archimedes' feats using the lever to lift very heavy objects. Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed block-and-tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move.[39] According to Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes' work on levers and his understanding of mechanical advantage caused him to remark: \"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth\" (Greek: \u03b4\u1ff6\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u1fb6 \u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u03b3\u1fb6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9).[40] Olympiodorus later attributed the same boast to Archimedes' invention of the baroulkos, a kind of windlass, rather than the lever.[41]/nA large part of Archimedes' work in engineering probably arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. Athenaeus of Naucratis quotes a certain Moschion in a description on how King Hiero II commissioned the design of a huge ship, the Syracusia, which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a display of naval power.[42] The Syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity and, according to Moschion's account, it was launched by Archimedes.[41] The ship presumably was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a gymnasium, and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities.[43] The account also mentions that, in order to remove any potential water leaking through the hull, a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder was designed by Archimedes./nArchimedes' screw was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a low-lying body of water into irrigation canals. The screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. Described by Vitruvius, Archimedes' device may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.[44][45] The world's first seagoing steamship with a screw propeller was the SS Archimedes, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.[46]/nArchimedes is said to have designed a claw as a weapon to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as \"the ship shaker\", the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it.[47]/nThere have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled Superweapons of the Ancient World built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.[48] Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult, and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.[49]/nArchimedes may have written a work on mirrors entitled Catoptrica,[c] and later authors believed he might have used mirrors acting collectively as a parabolic reflector to burn ships attacking Syracuse. Lucian wrote, in the second century AD, that during the siege of Syracuse Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Almost four hundred years later, Anthemius of Tralles mentions, somewhat hesitantly, that Archimedes could have used burning-glasses as a weapon.[50]/nOften called the \"Archimedes heat ray\", the purported mirror arrangement focused sunlight onto approaching ships, presumably causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a heliostat or solar furnace.[51]/nArchimedes' alleged heat ray has been the subject of an ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. Ren\u00e9 Descartes rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes, mostly with negative results.[52][53] It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished bronze or copper shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship, but the overall effect would have been blinding, dazzling, or distracting the crew of the ship rather than fire.[54]/nArchimedes discusses astronomical measurements of the Earth, Sun, and Moon, as well as Aristarchus' heliocentric model of the universe, in the Sand-Reckoner. Without the use of either trigonometry or a table of chords, Archimedes determines the Sun's apparent diameter by first describing the procedure and instrument used to make observations (a straight rod with pegs or grooves),[55][56] applying correction factors to these measurements, and finally giving the result in the form of upper and lower bounds to account for observational error.[18] Ptolemy, quoting Hipparchus, also references Archimedes' solstice observations in the Almagest. This would make Archimedes the first known Greek to have recorded multiple solstice dates and times in successive years.[19]/nCicero's De re publica portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse in the Second Punic War, Marcellus is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms which were constructed by Archimedes and which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero also mentions similar mechanisms designed by Thales of Miletus and Eudoxus of Cnidus. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by Gaius Sulpicius Gallus to Lucius Furius Philus, who described it thus:[57][58]/nHanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione./nWhen Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth when the Sun was in line./nThis is a description of a small planetarium. Pappus of Alexandria reports on a now lost treatise by Archimedes dealing with the construction of these mechanisms entitled On Sphere-Making.[24][59] Modern research in this area has been focused on the Antikythera mechanism, another device built c.\u2009100 BC probably designed with a similar purpose.[60] Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing.[61] This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.[62][63]/nWhile he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. Plutarch wrote that Archimedes \"placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life\",[27] though some scholars believe this may be a mischaracterization.[64][65][66]/nArchimedes was able to use indivisibles (a precursor to infinitesimals) in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus.[5] Through proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the areas of figures and the value of \u03c0./nIn Measurement of a Circle, he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle then a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of \u03c0 lay between 31/7 (approx. 3.1429) and 310/71 (approx. 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.[67] He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to \u03c0 multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (\n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\nr\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\textstyle \\pi r^{2}}\n\n)./nIn On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. Today this is known as the Archimedean property of real numbers.[68]/nArchimedes gives the value of the square root of 3 as lying between 265/153 (approximately 1.7320261) and 1351/780 (approximately 1.7320512) in Measurement of a Circle. The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused John Wallis to remark that he was: \"as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.\"[69] It is possible that he used an iterative procedure to calculate these values.[70][71]/nIn Quadrature of the Parabola, Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a corresponding inscribed triangle as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an infinite geometric series with the common ratio 1/4:/nIf the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller secant lines, and whose third vertex is where the line that is parallel to the parabola's axis and that passes through the midpoint of the base intersects the parabola, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 which sums to\u00a01/3./nIn The Sand Reckoner, Archimedes set out to calculate a number that was greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote:/nThere are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of Hiero II), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited./nTo solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad. The word itself derives from the Greek \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2, murias, for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million, i.e., 10,000 x 10,000) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 vigintillion, or 8\u00d71063.[72]/nThe works of Archimedes were written in Doric Greek, the dialect of ancient Syracuse.[73] Many written works by Archimedes have not survived or are only extant in heavily edited fragments; at least seven of his treatises are known to have existed due to references made by other authors.[8] Pappus of Alexandria mentions On Sphere-Making and another work on polyhedra, while Theon of Alexandria quotes a remark about refraction from the now-lost Catoptrica.[c]/nArchimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in Alexandria. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the Byzantine Greek architect Isidore of Miletus (c.\u2009530\u00a0AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra (836\u2013901\u00a0AD), and into Latin via Arabic by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114\u20131187). Direct Greek to Latin translations were later done by William of Moerbeke (c. 1215\u20131286) and Iacobus Cremonensis (c. 1400\u20131453).[74][75]/nDuring the Renaissance, the Editio princeps (First Edition) was published in Basel in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin.[76]/nThe following are ordered chronologically based on new terminological and historical criteria set by Knorr (1978) and Sato (1986).[77][78]/nThis is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with Dositheus of Pelusium, who was a student of Conon of Samos. In Proposition II, Archimedes gives an approximation of the value of pi (\u03c0), showing that it is greater than 223/71 and less than 22/7./nIn this treatise, also known as Psammites, Archimedes finds a number that is greater than the grains of sand needed to fill the universe. This book mentions the heliocentric theory of the solar system proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8\u00d71063 in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.[79]/nThere are two books to On the Equilibrium of Planes: the first contains seven postulates and fifteen propositions, while the second book contains ten propositions. In the first book, Archimedes proves the law of the lever, which states that:/nMagnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights./nArchimedes uses the principles derived to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures including triangles, parallelograms and parabolas.[80]/nIn this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 the area of a triangle with equal base and height. He achieves this in one of his proofs by calculating the value of a geometric series that sums to infinity with the ratio 1/4./nIn this two-volume treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a sphere and a circumscribed cylinder of the same height and diameter. The volume is 4/3\u03c0r3 for the sphere, and 2\u03c0r3 for the cylinder. The surface area is 4\u03c0r2 for the sphere, and 6\u03c0r2 for the cylinder (including its two bases), where r is the radius of the sphere and cylinder./nThis work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the Archimedean spiral. It is the locus of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity. Equivalently, in modern polar coordinates (r, \u03b8), it can be described by the equation \n\n\n\n\nr\n=\na\n+\nb\n\u03b8\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\,r=a+b\\theta }\n\n  with real numbers a and b./nThis is an early example of a mechanical curve (a curve traced by a moving point) considered by a Greek mathematician./nThis is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of sections of cones, spheres, and paraboloids./nThere are two books of On Floating Bodies. In the first book, Archimedes spells out the law of equilibrium of fluids and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as Eratosthenes that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not self-gravitating since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape. Archimedes' principle of buoyancy is given in this work, stated as follows:/nAny body wholly or partially immersed in fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in direction to, the weight of the fluid displaced./nIn the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float./nAlso known as Loculus of Archimedes or Archimedes' Box,[81] this is a dissection puzzle similar to a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Reviel Netz of Stanford University argued in 2003 that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways.[82] The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection are excluded.[83] The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics./nThe origin of the puzzle's name is unclear, and it has been suggested that it is taken from the Ancient Greek word for \"throat\" or \"gullet\", stomachos (\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2).[84] Ausonius calls the puzzle Ostomachion, a Greek compound word formed from the roots of osteon (\u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd, 'bone') and mach\u0113 (\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7, 'fight').[81]/nGotthold Ephraim Lessing discovered this work in a Greek manuscript consisting of a 44-line poem in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version of the problem in which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. A. Amthor first solved this version of the problem[85] in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271\u00d710206544.[86]/nThis treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses indivisibles,[5][6] and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. He may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria./nArchimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a treatise with 15 propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. T. L. Heath and Marshall Clagett argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.[87]/nIt has also been claimed that the formula for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes,[d] though its first appearance is in the work of Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD.[88] Other questionable attributions to Archimedes' work include the Latin poem Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris (4th or 5th century), which describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown, and the 12th-century text Mappae clavicula, which contains instructions on how to perform assaying of metals by calculating their specific gravities.[89][90]/nThe foremost document containing Archimedes' work is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople to examine a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers, written in the 13th century, after reading a short transcription published seven years earlier by Papadopoulos-Kerameus.[91][92] He confirmed that it was indeed a palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, a common practice in the Middle Ages, as vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th-century copies of previously lost treatises by Archimedes.[91][93] The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On 29 October 1998, it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million.[94]/nThe palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of On Floating Bodies in the original Greek. It is the only known source of The Method of Mechanical Theorems, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. Stomachion was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest was stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it was subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of ultraviolet and X-ray light to read the overwritten text.[95] It has since returned to its anonymous owner.[96][97]/nThe treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest include:/nSometimes called the father of mathematics and mathematical physics, Archimedes had a wide influence on mathematics and science.[98]/nHistorians of science and mathematics almost universally agree that Archimedes was the finest mathematician from antiquity. Eric Temple Bell, for instance, wrote:/nAny list of the three \u201cgreatest\u201d mathematicians of all history would include the name of Archimedes. The other two usually associated with him are Newton and Gauss. Some, considering the relative wealth\u2014or poverty\u2014of mathematics and physical science in the respective ages in which these giants lived, and estimating their achievements against the background of their times, would put Archimedes first.[99]/nLikewise, Alfred North Whitehead and George F. Simmons said of Archimedes:/n... in the year 1500 Europe knew less than Archimedes who died in the year 212 BC ...[100]/nIf we consider what all other men accomplished in mathematics and physics, on every continent and in every civilization, from the beginning of time down to the seventeenth century in Western Europe, the achievements of Archimedes outweighs it all. He was a great civilization all by himself.[101]/nReviel Netz, Suppes Professor in Greek Mathematics and Astronomy at Stanford University and an expert in Archimedes notes:/nAnd so, since Archimedes led more than anyone else to the formation of the calculus and since he was the pioneer of the application of mathematics to the physical world, it turns out that Western science is but a series of footnotes to Archimedes. Thus, it turns out that Archimedes is the most important scientist who ever lived.[102]/nLeonardo da Vinci repeatedly expressed admiration for Archimedes, and attributed his invention Architonnerre to Archimedes.[103][104][105] Galileo called him \"superhuman\" and \"my master\",[106][107] while Huygens said, \"I think Archimedes is comparable to no one\", consciously emulating him in his early work.[108] Leibniz said, \"He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less the achievements of the foremost men of later times\".[109] Gauss's heroes were Archimedes and Newton,[110] and Moritz Cantor, who studied under Gauss in the University of G\u00f6ttingen, reported that he once remarked in conversation that \"there had been only three epoch-making mathematicians: Archimedes, Newton, and Eisenstein\".[111]/nThe inventor Nikola Tesla praised him, saying:/nArchimedes was my ideal. I admired the works of artists, but to my mind, they were only shadows and semblances. The inventor, I thought, gives to the world creations which are palpable, which live and work.[112]/nThere is a crater on the Moon named Archimedes (29\u00b042\u2032N 4\u00b000\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff29.7\u00b0N 4.0\u00b0W\ufeff / 29.7; -4.0) in his honor, as well as a lunar mountain range, the Montes Archimedes (25\u00b018\u2032N 4\u00b036\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff25.3\u00b0N 4.6\u00b0W\ufeff / 25.3; -4.6).[113]/nThe Fields Medal for outstanding achievement in mathematics carries a portrait of Archimedes, along with a carving illustrating his proof on the sphere and the cylinder. The inscription around the head of Archimedes is a quote attributed to 1st century AD poet Manilius, which reads in Latin: Transire suum pectus mundoque potiri (\"Rise above oneself and grasp the world\").[114][115][116]/nArchimedes has appeared on postage stamps issued by East Germany (1973), Greece (1983), Italy (1983), Nicaragua (1971), San Marino (1982), and Spain (1963).[117]/nThe exclamation of Eureka! attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of California. In this instance, the word refers to the discovery of gold near Sutter's Mill in 1848 which sparked the California Gold Rush.[118]", "13240123": "B\u00e1rbara M.

Grossmann was a member of an old Swiss family from Zurich. His father managed a textile factory. He became a Professor of Mathematics at the Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, today the ETH Zurich, specializing in descriptive geometry./nIn 1900 Grossmann graduated from the Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) and became an assistant to the geometer Wilhelm Fiedler.[3] He continued to do research on non-Euclidean geometry and taught in high schools for the next seven years. In 1902, he earned his doctorate from the University of Zurich with the thesis Ueber die metrischen Eigenschaften kollinearer Gebilde (translated On the Metrical Properties of Collinear Structures) with Fiedler as advisor. In 1907, he was appointed full professor of descriptive geometry at the Federal Polytechnic School.[4]/nAs a professor of geometry, Grossmann organized summer courses for high school teachers. In 1910, he became one of the founders of the Swiss Mathematical Society. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge[5] and in 1920 at Strasbourg./nAlbert Einstein's friendship with Grossmann began with their school days in Zurich. Grossmann's careful and complete lecture notes at the Federal Polytechnic School proved to be a salvation for Einstein, who missed many lectures.[6] Grossmann's father helped Einstein get his job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern,[7] and it was Grossmann who helped to conduct the negotiations to bring Einstein back from Prague as a professor of physics at the Zurich Polytechnic. Grossmann was an expert in differential geometry and tensor calculus; just the mathematical tools providing a proper mathematical framework for Einstein's work on gravity. Thus, it was natural that Einstein would enter into a scientific collaboration with Grossmann.[8]/nIt was Grossmann who emphasized the importance of a non-Euclidean geometry called Riemannian geometry (also elliptic geometry) to Einstein, which was a necessary step in the development of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Abraham Pais's book[9] on Einstein suggests that Grossmann mentored Einstein in tensor theory as well. Grossmann introduced Einstein to the absolute differential calculus, started by Elwin Bruno Christoffel[10] and fully developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita.[11] Grossmann facilitated Einstein's unique synthesis of mathematical and theoretical physics in what is still today considered the most elegant and powerful theory of gravity: the general theory of relativity. The collaboration of Einstein and Grossmann led to a ground-breaking paper: \"Outline of a Generalized Theory of Relativity and of a Theory of Gravitation\", which was published in 1913 and was one of the two fundamental papers which established Einstein's theory of gravity.[12]/nGrossmann died of multiple sclerosis in 1936.[13] The community of relativists celebrates Grossmann's contributions to physics by organizing Marcel Grossmann meetings every three years./nThe International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics presents the Marcel Grossmann Awards.

As a high schooler, he solved Hilbert's tenth problem, shortly after Yuri Matiyasevich had solved it.[1] He received a mathematics degree from Kyiv State University in 1974 and a PhD the following year from the Institute of Mathematics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.[2]/nIn part to avoid religious persecution and in part to seek better medical care for Gregory, who had been diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease, the Chudnovsky family applied in 1976 for permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union.[3][2] Although the family was harassed by the KGB for attempting to leave the country, the brothers were eventually able to secure their emigration with the help of United States Senator Henry M.

A 1997 Karen Arenson article in The New York Times theorized that this was due to some combination of the brothers' lack of a specialization (they worked on topics including number theory, applied physics and computers), Gregory's medical condition, their refusal to leave New York City and their insistence on being hired together. In the summer of 1997, they were hired as professors at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn after borough president Howard Golden helped find funding for their salaries.[6]/nThe Chudnovsky brothers have held records, at different times, for computing \u03c0 to the largest number of places, including two billion digits in the early 1990s on a supercomputer they built (dubbed \"m-zero\") in their apartment in Manhattan. In 1987, the Chudnovsky brothers developed the algorithm (now called the Chudnovsky algorithm) that they used to break several \u03c0 computation records. Today, this algorithm is used by Mathematica to calculate \u03c0, and has continued to be used by others who have achieved world records in pi calculation./nThe brothers also assisted the Metropolitan Museum of Art around 2003 in the merging of a series of digital photographs taken of The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries during their cleaning.[7] PBS aired a program on its science show Nova, hosted by Robert Krulwich, that described the difficulties in photographing the tapestries and the math used to fix them.[8]/nThe brothers later became Distinguished Industry Professors at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, where they work on subjects such as graph isomorphism.[9] Gregory was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship (also known as the \"Genius Grant\") in 1981.", "49809215": "Giovanni Battista Pisani, also known as Gio.

He is most known for his extensive correspondence with leading scientists and mathematicians such as Giovanni Alfonso Borelli, Gottfried Leibniz, Isaac Newton, and John Wallis. His correspondence provides details of many of the discoveries and developments made in his time, and shows his role in making some of these discoveries available to a wider audience. He was called \"English Mersenne\" for his extensive collecting and diffusing of scientific information.[1]/nHe was the son of a nonconformist minister, and was born at Wood Eaton in Oxfordshire, 5 March 1625. Apprenticed at the age of sixteen to Thomas Allam, a bookseller, living outside the Turl Gate of Oxford, he was driven to quit the trade by the troubles of the time, and accepted a clerkship in the employment of John Marr, clerk of the kitchen to the Prince of Wales. From him he derived some instruction in mathematics, but the outbreak of the First English Civil War drove him to sea for seven years, 1642-9, most of which time he spent on board an English merchantman, engaged by the Venetians as a ship of war in their defence of Candia against the Turks./nHe devoted his leisure to the study of mathematics and merchants' accounts, and on leaving the service set up in London as a teacher. In 1652 he published An Introduction to Merchants' Accounts, originally drawn up for the use of his scholars. Reprinted in 1665, the major part of the impression perished in the great fire of London, but was replaced in 1674 by a new and amplified folio edition. He next wrote The Sector on a Quadrant, or a Treatise containing the Description and Use of three several Quadrants. Also an appendix touching Reflected Dyalling, from a Glass however posited (London, 1658); and The Description and Uses of a general Quadrant, with the Horizontal Projection upon it Inverted (1658). In 1659 appeared his Geometricall Dyalling, or Dyalling performed by a Line of Chords only, and The Mariner's Plain Scale new Plained, a treatise on navigation for the East India Company's navy. It was well received, and became a class-book with the students of navigation at Christ Church Hospital./nAfter the Restoration, Collins was appointed successively accountant to the excise office, accountant in chancery, and secretary to the council of plantations, exchanging the last post in 1672 for that of manager of the farthing office. With this employment went a house in Fenchurch Street, where he had thoughts of setting up a stationer's shop, and hoped 'to fall into the printing of books,' including some he himself designed to write, 'particularly one of the modern advancement of mathematical sciences, and an account of the best authors of that kind'. He did not, however, succeed in carrying the plan into effect. With the failure of his arguments against the issue of tin farthings his office ceased, and he was glad subsequently to accept a small post as accountant to the Royal Fishery Company./nHe had refused in March 1669 a situation offered to him in Ireland by the surveyor-general, Sir James Shaen, and about the same time married one of two daughters of William Austen, head cook to Charles II. As his family increased his means of subsistence became more and more precarious. He undertook accountancy work, spending less time on learned correspondence./nSeveral of his writings testify to his acquaintance with the course of trade and interest in public matters. He published in 1680 A Plea for the bringing in of Irish Cattel, and keeping out Fish caught by Foreigners, together with an humble Address to the Honourable members of parliament of the counties of Cornwall and Devon, about the Advancement of Tin, Fishery, and divers Manufactures; and in 1682 a little treatise entitled Salt and Fishery, in which he dwelt upon the several modes of preparing salt in England and abroad, the catching of fish, the salting and cooking of fish and meat, besides offering proposals for the relief of the salt-workers./nCollins died, 10 November 1683, at his lodging on Garlick Hill, London, of asthma and consumption, and was buried in the parish church of St. James./nAn enlarged edition of his Doctrine of Decimal Arithmetick, the preparation of which had engaged his attention during about a year before his death, appeared in 1685. It had originally been printed in 1664 on a quarter of a sheet for portability in a letter-case. His Arithmetic in whole Numbers and Fractions, both Vulgar and Decimal, with Tables for the Forbearance and Rebate of Money, &c., was published by Thomas Plant in 1688./nCollins was elected a fellow of the Royal Society 24 October 1667, and on 11 November of that year communicated an exposition of a theorem by the Jesuit Jacques de Billy.[2] He contributed further An Account concerning the Resolution of Equations in Numbers, a survey of recent algebra improvements made in England, and A Solution of a Chorographical Problem; while a letter written to John Wallis, 3 October 1682, was imparted to the society 20 May 1684. This was designed as preliminary to a formal treatise on algebra, never written./nHe helped forward many important publications. To him was due the printing of Isaac Barrow's Optical and Geometrical Lectures, as well as of his editions of Apollonius and Archimedes; of John Kersey's Algebra, Thomas Branker's translation of Rhonius's Algebra, and Wallis's History of Algebra. He took an active part in seeing Jeremiah Horrocks's Astronomical Remains through the press./nAbout twenty-five years after Collins's death his books and papers came into the possession of William Jones, F.R.S. They included a voluminous correspondence with Newton, Leibniz, Gregory, Barrow, John Flamsteed, Wallis, Slusius, and others. From it was selected and published in 1712, by order of the Royal Society, the Commercium Epistolicum, of material relevant to Newton's priority over Leibniz in the discovery of the infinitesimal calculus; specimens of results from the use of the fluxional method were transmitted 20 July 1669 through Barrow to Collins, and by him made widely known.", "56690510": "Carola-Bibiane Sch\u00f6nlieb (born 1979)[1] is an Austrian mathematician who works in image processing and partial differential equations.

He replaced Demetrios Kokkidis becoming the fifth director of the National Observatory of Athens and the longest-serving director in the Observatory's history.  He was one of the few Greek astronomers in modern Greek history during the 1800s, others included Georgios Konstantinos Vouris and Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt.  He served as Minister of Education twice.[1][2]/nEginitis was born in Athens, he attended the prestigious Varvakeio School of Athens and later attended the University of Athens studying Mathematics from 1879 to 1886.  He received a scholarship to study astronomy and mathematics at the Sorbonne from 1886 to 1890.  While in France he wrote his world-renowned paper Sur la Stabilit\u00e9 du Syst\u00e8me Solaire (On the Stability of the Solar System) and also published over one thousand astronomical observations.  He returned to Greece and revived the Athens Observatory breaking it into three divisions Astronomy, Meteorology, and Geodynamics.  He became a professor at the University of Athens a position he held from 1896 to 1934.  He introduced the Eastern European Time Zone in Greece and the Gregorian calendar replacing the Julian calendar as the country's standard.  He founded the Academy of Athens and organized the University of Thessaloniki.[3][4][5]/nHe was a member of the IAU Committee on Meridian Observations.  Eginitis was also a member of the German Astronomical Society (Astronomische Gesellschaft), the Royal Astronomical Society in London, the French Astronomical Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astronomique de France), the Portuguese Institute of Coibra and the International Meteorological Committee (Comit\u00e9 M\u00e9t\u00e9orologique International).

Demetri's brother was also a astrophysicist named Vasileios Aiginitis.  Demetrios married Anthi Efthymiou and the couple had one daughter named Aigli.  Demetrios graduated from the famous Varvakeio School of Athens in 1879.  By the age of 17, he attended the University of Athens and remained at the institution from 1879 to 1886.  He studied mathematics with some of Greece's most brilliant minds of the time namely John Hazzidakis, Cyparissos Stephanos, Vassilios Lakon, and Nikolaos Nikolaidis.  Because of his outstanding performance as a student, the Athens University Council for post-doctoral studies awarded him a scholarship to study astronomy and mathematics at the Sorbonne from 1886 to 1890.  He left Greece at 24 years of age.[8]/nInitially, he was accepted as an apprentice astronomer (\u00e9l\u00e8ve astronome) at the meteorological observatory of Parc Montsouris.  He was also affiliated with the Paris Observatory.  For two years Demetrios traveled around France and England working at different astronomical facilities namely the meteorological centre of Parc Saint Maur, the Meudon Observatory, the Observatory of Nice and Lockyer\u2019s astronomical laboratory in England.  By 1889 he was awarded a staff astronomer at the Paris Observatory.  He also did extensive research on Stellar Spectra with Georges Salet and Alfred Cornu.[9]/nEginitis carried out equatorial observations following the meridian circle using the meridian telescope located in the western dome of the Paris Observatory.  He also observed asteroids and variable stars with the telescope.  While he was at the Paris Observatory Eginitis also studied the secular variations of the semi-major axes of planetary orbits under the supervision of Ernest Mouchez.  He submitted his work to the Paris Academy in 1889 and Ernest Mouchez presented it.  The work was entitled Sur la Stabilit\u00e9 du Syst\u00e8me Solaire (On the Stability of the Solar System).  Eginitis became internationally known for his work.[10][11]/nThe Athens Observatory was funded by Simon Sinas.  Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt, his research and equipment were all financed by the fund.  When Schmidt and Sinas died the Observatory was no longer funded. Greek astronomer Demetrios Kokkidis managed the Observatory with no salary for a short period making minor advancements in the field of astronomy.  Kokkidis was extremely busy teaching at three different institutions. The Greek government decided to ask Eginitis to take over the dilapidated structure and in 1890 they passed a special law under the government of Charilaos Trikoupis.  Eginitis was responsible for updating the equipment and beginning a new era of research for the facility.  He was the longest-serving director of the National Observatory of Athens from 1890 to 1934. It is the oldest research institution in Greece.  By the year 1895, Eginitis established three departments within the National Observatory of Athens: Astronomy, Meteorology, and Geodynamics.[12][13]/nEginitis expanded the network of weather stations and created dozens of provincial weather stations.  The astronomer also established seismological stations to monitor earthquakes and other geophysical activity.  By 1896, he became professor of Meteorology and Astronomy at the University of Athens a position he held until 1934, roughly thirty-eight years.  He also taught Astronomy and Geodesy at Evelpidon.  He served as dean of the Philosophical School from 1903-1904.  He lobbied to separate the scientific departments from the Philosophical School.  The  School of Physics and Mathematics was established in 1904 and he was the dean of that school from 1908-1909.[14][15]/nA vast European network of railroads connected with Greece and a universal timezone was necessary to communicate with the rest of the world. Eginitis persuaded the Greek Government to adopt the Eastern European Time Zone on July 28, 1916.  The standard is still used today.  Eginitis served as Minister of Education in 1917, a position he held for about one year, that same year the King of Greece had to resign.  Eginitis was highly respected by the Greek royal family. Eginitis and Fokion Negris helped write the resignation speech for Constantine I.  Constantine was pressured to resign because of World War I.  His wife was Wilhelm II's sister.   Constantine's son and Wilhelm II's nephew Alexander assumed the throne for three years until his father assumed the throne once again for another two years.[16]/nThe Greek church followed the Julian calendar for over one thousand years and it was the acceptable calendar in modern Greece.  Regrettably, the rest of the world followed the Gregorian calendar.  Eginitis lobbied the church and state to follow the uniform internationally accepted calendar.  The calendar was accepted in 1923 but the church still observes festivals including easter following the traditional Julian calendar.[17]  Three years later in 1926, he served as  Minister of Education for a second time.  He helped organize the University of Thessaloniki and was also one of the founders of the Academy of Athens by 1928, he was the vice-president and in 1929, the 4th President of the Academy of Athens.  He remained the general secretary of the institution until 1933.  The Academy of Athens was one of the astronomer's greatest gifts to the Greek people.[18]/nEginitis had an astonishing career as a scientist.  He was a world-renowned astronomer.  He wrote countless articles and books in the field of astronomy.  He died on March 13, 1934.  The municipality of Athens donated a small mausoleum at the First Cemetery of Athens.  Eginitis had a state funeral at the church Agios Georgios Karytsis.  The oration was given by the Dean of the School of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Athens Chemistry professor Konstantinos D. Zeghelis.  The University of Thessaloniki also had a special ceremony for the professor.  He was also mourned internationally by various publications.[19][20]/nThe planets orbit around the Sun but they also independently rotate. Astronomers debated the stability of the Solar System.  The Solar System was understood to be chaotic, although it seemed to be stable.  Observational Astronomers noticed by viewing Jupiter and Saturn via astronomical telescopes that Jupiter's orbit appeared to be shrinking while that of Saturn was expanding.  This caused alarm, and an explanation was sought Pierre-Simon Laplace, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson proposed an explanation using complex mathematics.  Laplace found a common trend within the Jupiter\u2013Saturn system.  Five periods of Jupiter's orbit around the Sun are equal to two periods of Saturn's orbit. Laplace concluded that any two planets and the Sun must be in mutual equilibrium and thereby launched his work on the stability of the Solar System.  In 1786, he proved that the eccentricities and inclinations of planetary orbits to each other always remain small, constant, and self-correcting.  Eignities built on this research and performed similar calculations for Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn using complex mathematics.[21][22][23]/nWhile Eignities was in France he tried to solve difficult astronomical problems.  The first problem was the belief our world will be destroyed. Eignities concluded the Earth would approach the Sun for 20,000 years and then the semi-major axis of orbit will start to increase for a specific period and the cycle will continue.  Similar to the work of Laplace and his contemporaries.  The next important question was if the Earth would approach the Sun leading to the destruction of all life.  Eginitis postulated that the variations in the average distance to the Sun were so minuscule that it would not have an effect on Earth.  Because of his work, he gained the respect of the international astronomical community, and Camille Flammarion specifically congratulated his efforts.

His parents were Arnold and Pearl Post.[2]/nPost had been interested in astronomy, but at the age of twelve lost his left arm in a car accident. This loss was a significant obstacle to being a professional astronomer, leading to his decision to pursue mathematics rather than astronomy.[3]/nPost attended the Townsend Harris High School and continued on to graduate from City College of New York in 1917 with a B.S. in mathematics.[1]/nAfter completing his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1920 at Columbia University, supervised by Cassius Jackson Keyser, he did a post-doctorate at Princeton University in the 1920\u20131921 academic year.

He died in 1954 of a heart attack following electroshock treatment for depression;[5][6] he was 57./nIn his doctoral thesis, later shortened and published as \"Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions\" (1921), Post proved, among other things, that the propositional calculus of Principia Mathematica was complete: all tautologies are theorems, given the Principia axioms and the rules of substitution and modus ponens. Post also devised truth tables independently of C. S. Peirce and Ludwig Wittgenstein and put them to good mathematical use. Jean van Heijenoort's well-known source book on mathematical logic (1966) reprinted Post's classic 1921 article setting out these results./nWhile at Princeton, Post came very close to discovering the incompleteness of Principia Mathematica, which Kurt G\u00f6del proved in 1931. Post initially failed to publish his ideas as he believed he needed a 'complete analysis' for them to be accepted.[2] As Post said in a postcard to G\u00f6del in 1938:/nIn 1936, Post developed, independently of Alan Turing, a mathematical model of computation that was essentially equivalent to the Turing machine model. Intending this as the first of a series of models of equivalent power but increasing complexity, he titled his paper Formulation 1. This model is sometimes called \"Post's machine\" or a Post\u2013Turing machine, but is not to be confused with Post's tag machines or other special kinds of Post canonical system, a computational model using string rewriting and developed by Post in the 1920s but first published in 1943.  Post's rewrite technique is now ubiquitous in programming language specification and design, and so with Church's lambda calculus is a salient influence of classical modern logic on practical computing. Post devised a method of 'auxiliary symbols' by which he could canonically represent any Post-generative language, and indeed any computable function or set at all./nCorrespondence systems were introduced by Post in 1946 to give simple examples of undecidability.[8] He showed that the Post correspondence problem (PCP) of satisfying their constraints is, in general, undecidable. The undecidability of the correspondence problem turned out to be exactly what was needed to obtain undecidability results in the theory of formal languages./nIn an influential address to the American Mathematical Society in 1944, he raised the question of the existence of an uncomputable recursively enumerable set whose Turing degree is less than that of the halting problem. This question, which became known as Post's problem, stimulated much research. It was solved in the affirmative in the 1950s by the introduction of the powerful priority method in computability theory./nPost made a fundamental and still-influential contribution to the theory of polyadic, or n-ary, groups in a long paper published in 1940.  His major theorem showed that a polyadic group is the iterated multiplication of elements of a normal subgroup of a group, such that the quotient group is cyclic of order n \u2212 1.

In August 1915 the Russian forces that had held Poland for many years withdrew. Germany and Austria-Hungary took control of most of the country and the University of Warsaw was refounded and it began operating as a Polish university.

His work led to homological algebra. It was during Hurewicz's time as Brouwer's assistant in Amsterdam that he did the work on the higher homotopy groups; \"...the idea was not new, but until Hurewicz nobody had pursued it as it should have been.

Thereafter until his death, he followed a career as an academic at the Ilmenau University of Technology.[3]/nWalther, who is the namesake of the Walther graph, died in 2005 of a heart attack during a soccer game./nWalther about the principles of the DSU/n/nDuring the Peaceful Revolution, Walther first cofounded the German Forum Party in 1989, before cofounding the newly established German Social Union in 1990. The DSU was a right-wing party modelled after the Bavarian CSU,[5] which financially supported it in hopes of establishing a presence outside of Bavaria.[6]/nIn the 1990 Volkskammer election, Walther was the lead candidate of his party.[7] He was elected to the Volkskammer for Suhl. The German Social Union, as part of the victorious Alliance for Germany, entered government, Walther playing a role as leader of the DSU parliamentary group. In the Volkskammer, the DSU under his leadership advocated for an immediate German reunification, even as early as August.[6] The DSU also, successfully, proposed the removal of the GDR's national emblem from all public buildings.[4]/nIn June 1990, Walther, previously deputy leader since the founding in January, was elected leader of the German Social Union.[8] His ascension to the leadership meant a further right-wing drift of the party, causing some, most notably former leader and Minister for Economic Cooperation Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling as well as Deputy Minister-President of East Germany Peter-Michael Diestel, to leave the party in protest.[6]/nWalther faced many problems as leader of the DSU. The party suffered from electoral decline,[9] was disorganized, both in terms of the internal organisation, most notably membership records,[8] of the party and the Volkskammer group; for example, the DSU held the deputy chairmanship of the Volkskammer's powerful budget committee, but the DSU swapped out its chairman two times in just half a year.[4] The Volkskammer group under Walther also frequently clashed with its coalition partners, most notably on the issue of the date of German reunification; all other parties in the coalition discussed much later dates and had to resort to parliamentary maneuvering to shut down the DSU's frequent proposals of an immediate reunification.[4][10]/nThe internal turmoil of the party also stoked conflict; ministers Ebeling and Diestel had left the DSU (both joining the CDU shortly thereafter), but stayed on as ministers. Walther called for their removal,[4] but to no avail, meaning the DSU was technically part of the de Maizi\u00e8re cabinet, but without representation./nIn the case of Deputy Minister-President Diestel, the DSU Volkskammer group had already tried to oust him back in May due to Diestel's alleged softness in dealing with employees that were former Stasi agents. Walther even proclaimed to have a successor to Diestel ready, but refused to name him.[7]/nWalther was one of 144 Volkskammer co-opted to the Bundestag following German reunification. Walther, alongside other East German political leaders, was appointed Minister for Special Affairs in the Third Kohl cabinet./nIn the 1990 German federal election, the DSU under his leadership failed to pass the five-percent threshold. The party received only about 1\u00a0% in the new states and 0,19\u00a0% nationwide.[11] The DSU, already fearing it would miss the five percent threshold nationwide, had originally advocated for the five percent threshold being separate for former East Germany.[4]/nA large reason for their crushing defeat was the adamant refusal of the CDU and Helmut Kohl personally of a demand by the CSU, whereby the CDU would stand down in three single-member constituencies, which would have allowed the DSU to bypass the five-percent threshold. Walther had defended this so-called Huckepackverfahren (English: piggybacking), which has had historical precedent, for example in the 1957 West German federal election, from accusations of favoritism in the Volkskammer.[12]/nThe party also failed to make inroads in the 1990 state elections in former East Germany and after the CSU dropped its immense financial support, the party quickly faded into irrelevancy.[6] Walther himself joined the Christian Democratic Union in 1993, for which he was elected to the Ilm-Kreis district council.", "49481662": "Andreas Brandst\u00e4dt (born 17 January 1949 in Arnstadt, East Germany) is a German mathematician and computer scientist./nHe graduated from the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, Germany, with a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in stochastics in 1976 and a habilitation (Dr. sc. nat.) in complexity theory in 1983.\nSince 1974 he worked there in the group of his academic teacher Gerd Wechsung./nFrom 1991 to 1994, he was the professor for Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics,\n[1] at the University of Duisburg, Germany,\nand from 1994 to 2014 he was the professor for Theoretical Computer Science[2] at the University of Rostock, Germany./nHe was a visiting professor at the universities of Metz, Amiens, and Clermont-Ferrand (France) and at the University of Primorska in Koper\n(Slovenia).

Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in Hinduism and Sanskrit literature: he had taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.[4][5] After teaching for one year at Aix-Marseille University, he taught for six years at University of Strasbourg. He married \u00c9veline de Possel (n\u00e9e \u00c9veline Gillet) in 1937.[6]/nWeil was in Finland when World War II broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife \u00c9veline returned to France without him. Weil was arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the Winter War on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.[7] Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at Le Havre in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then Rouen. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in Cherbourg. After the fall of France in June 1940, he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where he managed to join his wife \u00c9veline, who had been living in German-occupied France./nIn January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he did not have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. He quit the job at Lehigh and moved to Brazil, where he taught at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo from 1945 to 1947, working with Oscar Zariski. Weil and his wife had two daughters, Sylvie (born in 1942) and Nicolette (born in 1946).[6]/nHe then returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,[8] in 1954 in Amsterdam,[9] and in 1978 in Helsinki.[10] Weil was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1966.[1] In 1979, he shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray./nWeil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell\u2013Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel's theorem on integral points).[11] Mordell's theorem had an ad hoc proof;[12] Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach, by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories./nAmong his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions of curves over finite fields,[13] and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively). The so-called Weil conjectures were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by Bernard Dwork,[14] Alexander Grothendieck,[15][16][17] Michael Artin, and finally by Pierre Deligne, who completed the most difficult step in 1973.[18][19][20][21][22]/nWeil introduced the adele ring[23] in the late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his Basic Number Theory in 1967).[24] His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann\u2013Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers[25] proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) became known as the Taniyama\u2013Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama\u2013Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikk\u014d conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.[26]/nOther significant results were on Pontryagin duality and differential geometry.[27] He introduced the concept of a uniform space in general topology, as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with Henri Cartan in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also chose the symbol \u2205, derived from the letter \u00d8 in the Norwegian alphabet (which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with), to represent the empty set.[28]/nWeil also made a well-known contribution in Riemannian geometry in his very first paper in 1926, when he showed that the classical isoperimetric inequality holds on non-positively curved surfaces. This established the 2-dimensional case of what later became known as the Cartan\u2013Hadamard conjecture./nHe discovered that the so-called Weil representation, previously introduced in quantum mechanics by Irving Segal and David Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of quadratic forms.[29] This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting representation theory and theta functions./nWeil was a member of both the National Academy of Sciences[30] and the American Philosophical Society.[31]/nWeil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of Bourbaki, before and after World War\u00a0II. He also wrote several books on the history of number theory./nHindu thought had great influence on Weil.[32] He was an agnostic,[33] and he respected religions.[34]/nAsteroid 289085 Andreweil, discovered by astronomers at the Saint-Sulpice Observatory in 2004, was named in his memory.[35] The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 February 2014 (M.P.C. 87143).[36]/nMathematical works:/nCollected papers:/nAutobiography:/nMemoir by his daughter:", "24315876": "Vladimir Rokhlin Jr. (born August 4, 1952) is a mathematician[1][2] and professor of computer science and mathematics at Yale University.[3] He is the co-inventor with Leslie Greengard of the fast multipole method (FMM) in 1985, recognised as one of the top-ten algorithms of the 20th century.[1][4][5]/nIn 2008, Rokhlin was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for the development of fast multipole algorithms and their application to electromagnetic and acoustic scattering./nVladimir Rokhlin Jr. was born on August 4, 1952, in Voronezh, USSR (now Russia).

Both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula/nwhere/nfor primes \n\n\n\np\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p}\n\n. He established this result by elementary means in March 1948, and by July of that year, Selberg and Paul Erd\u0151s each obtained elementary proofs of the prime number theorem, both using the asymptotic formula above as a starting point.[4] Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.[5][6]/nFor his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950 Fields Medal./nSelberg moved to the United States and worked as an associate professor at Syracuse University and later settled at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in the 1950s, where he remained until his death.[1][7] During the 1950s he worked on introducing spectral theory into number theory, culminating in his development of the Selberg trace formula, the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of closed geodesics on a compact Riemann surface and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which is analogous to the duality between the prime numbers and the zeros of the zeta function./nHe was awarded the 1986 Wolf Prize in Mathematics.

He published high-level academic articles and books, not only on mathematics, but also on physics, history, philosophy, and pedagogy. Levi was a member of the Bologna Academy of Sciences and of the Accademia dei Lincei./nBeppo Levi was born on May 14, 1875, in Turin, Italy, and he was an older brother of Eugenio Elia Levi.[1]  He obtained his laurea in mathematics in 1896 at age 21 from the University of Turin under Corrado Segre.[1][2] He was appointed an assistant professor at the University of Turin three months later and shortly thereafter became a full-time Scholar.[1] Levi was appointed Professor at the University of Piacenza in 1901, at the University of Cagliari in 1906, at the University of Parma in 1910, and finally at the University of Bologna in 1928.[3] The years that followed his last appointment saw the rise of  Benito Mussolini's power and of  antisemitism in Italy, and Levi, being Jewish, was soon expelled from his  position at the University of Bologna.[3] He emigrated to Argentina, as did many other European Jews at that time./nLevi chose Argentina because of an invitation by the engineer Cort\u00e9s Pl\u00e1, dean of the Facultad de Ciencias Matem\u00e1ticas, F\u00edsico-Qu\u00edmicas y Naturales Aplicadas a la Industria at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (currently Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Ingenier\u00eda y Agrimensura at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario) in the city of Rosario.

It was there that Levi did most of his work from 1939 until his death in 1961./nWhile living in Rosario, Levi joined a group of mathematicians  that included Luis Santal\u00f3, Sim\u00f3n Rubinstein, Juan Olgu\u00edn, Enrique Ferrari, Fernando and Enrique Gaspar, Mario Castagnino and Edmundo Rofman. In 1940 Levi founded Mathematicae Notae, the first mathematical journal in Argentina.[4]  In 1956 he was awarded the Feltrinelli Prize.[4]/nHe died on August 28, 1961, in Rosario, Argentina, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery there.[4]/nHis early work studied singularities on algebraic curves and surfaces.[5]  In particular, he supplied a proof (questioned by some) that a procedure for resolution of singularities on algebraic surfaces terminates in finitely many steps.[5]  Later he proved some foundational results concerning Lebesgue integration, including what is commonly known as Beppo Levi's lemma.[6]/nHe also studied the arithmetic of elliptic curves.  He classified them up to isomorphism, not only over C, but also over Q.  Next he studied what in modern terminology would be the subgroup of rational torsion points on an elliptic curve over Q: he proved that certain groups were realizable and that others were not.  He essentially formulated the torsion conjecture for elliptic curves over the rational numbers, providing a complete list of possibilities should be, which was formulated independently by Andrew Ogg about 60 years later and finally proved by Barry Mazur in 1973.[7]/nMedia related to Beppo Levi at Wikimedia Commons", "755690": "Francesco Maria Grimaldi, SJ (2 April 1618 \u2013 28 December 1663) was an Italian Jesuit priest, mathematician and physicist who taught at the Jesuit college in Bologna.  He was born in Bologna to Paride Grimaldi and Anna Cattani.[1]/nBetween 1640 and 1650, working with Riccioli, he investigated the free fall of objects, confirming that the distance of fall was proportional to the square of the time taken. Grimaldi and Riccioli also made a calculation of gravity at the earth's surface by recording the oscillations of an accurate pendulum.[2]/nIn astronomy, he built and used instruments to measure lunar mountains as well as the height of clouds, and drew an accurate map or, selenograph, which was published by Riccioli and now adorns the entrance to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C./nHe was the first to make accurate observations on the diffraction of light[3][4] (although by some accounts Leonardo da Vinci had earlier noted it[5]), and coined the word 'diffraction'. In his book Physico-Mathesis de Lumine, Coloribus et Iride (1665), he stated the theory of the reconstitution of sunlight from refracted coloured light. [6]/nThrough experimentation he was able to demonstrate that the observed passage of light could not be reconciled with the idea that it moved in a rectilinear path. Rather, the light that passed through the hole took on the shape of a cone. Later physicists used his work as evidence that light was a wave, significantly, Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens.

He is best known for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, for which he was awarded the 2016 Abel Prize[6] and the 2017 Copley Medal by the Royal Society.[2] He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2000, and in 2018, was appointed the first Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford.[7] Wiles is also a 1997 MacArthur Fellow./nWiles was born in Cambridge to theologian Maurice Frank Wiles and his wife Patricia. While spending much of his childhood in Nigeria, Wiles developed an interest in mathematics and in Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem in particular. After moving to Oxford and graduating from there in 1974, he worked on unifying Galois representations, elliptic curves and modular forms, starting with Barry Mazur\u2019s generalizations of Iwasawa theory. In the early 1980s, Wiles moved to Princeton University from Cambridge and worked on expanding out and applying Hilbert modular forms. In 1986, upon reading Ken Ribet\u2019s seminal work on Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, Wiles set out to prove the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which implied Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. By 1993, he had been able to prove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, though a flaw was discovered. After an insight on 19 September 1994, Wiles and his student Richard Taylor were able to circumvent the flaw, and published the results in 1995, to widespread acclaim./nIn proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, Wiles developed new tools for mathematicians to begin unifying disparate ideas and theorems. His former student Taylor along with three other mathematicians were able to prove the full modularity theorem by 2000, using Wiles\u2019 work. Upon receiving the Abel Prize in 2016, Wiles reflected on his legacy, expressing his belief that he did not just prove Fermat\u2019s Last  Theorem, but pushed the whole of mathematics as a field towards the Langlands program of unifying number theory.[8]/nWiles was born on 11 April 1953[9] in Cambridge, England, the son of Maurice Frank Wiles (1923\u20132005) and Patricia Wiles (n\u00e9e Mowll). From 1952 to 1955, his father worked as the chaplain at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, and later became the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford.[5]/nWiles began his formal schooling in Nigeria, while living there as a very young boy with his parents. However, according to letters written by his parents, for at least the first several months after he was supposed to be attending classes, he refused to go. From that fact, Wiles himself concluded that in his earliest years, he was not enthusiastic about spending time in academic institutions. He trusts the letters, though he could not remember a time when he did not enjoy solving mathematical problems.[10]/nWiles attended King's College School, Cambridge,[11] and The Leys School, Cambridge.[12] Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped at his local library where he found a book The Last Problem, by Eric Temple Bell, about the theorem.[13] Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but that no one had proven, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by Ken Ribet's 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture, which Gerhard Frey had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.[14]/nIn 1974, Wiles earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics at Merton College, Oxford.[5] Wiles's graduate research was guided by John Coates, beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by the methods of Iwasawa theory. He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the rational numbers, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to totally real fields.[15][16]/nIn 1980, Wiles earned a PhD while at Clare College, Cambridge.[4] After a stay at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1981, Wiles became a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University.[17]/nIn 1985\u201386, Wiles was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques near Paris and at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure./nIn 1987, Wiles was elected to the Royal Society. At that point according to his election certificate, he had been working \"on the construction of \u2113-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the 'main conjecture' for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields\".[15]/nFrom 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford, and then he returned to Princeton.\nFrom 1994 to 2009, Wiles was a Eugene Higgins Professor at Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.[17]/nIn May 2018, Wiles was appointed Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford, the first in the university's history.[7]/nStarting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet, it became clear that Fermat's Last Theorem (the statement that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2) could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the modularity theorem (unproven at the time and then known as the \"Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture\"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area, and stated that all such curves have a modular form associated with them.[18][19] These curves can be thought of as mathematical objects resembling solutions for a torus\u2019 surface, and if Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem were false and solutions existed, \u201ca peculiar curve would result\u201d. A proof of the theorem therefore would involve showing that such a curve would not exist.[20]/nThe conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.[21]:\u200a203\u2013205,\u200a223,\u200a226\u200a For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor John Coates stated that it seemed \"impossible to actually prove\",[21]:\u200a226\u200a and Ken Ribet considered himself \"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\", adding that \"Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it].\"[21]:\u200a223/nDespite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for Frey's curve.[21]:\u200a226\u200a He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.[21]:\u200a229\u2013230/nWiles\u2019 research involved creating a proof by contradiction of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which Ribet in his 1986 work had found to have an elliptic curve and thus an associated modular form if true. Starting by assuming that the theorem was incorrect, Wiles then contradicted the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture as formulated under that assumption, with Ribet\u2019s theorem (which stated that if n were a prime number, no such elliptic curve could have a modular form, so no odd prime counterexample to Fermat's equation could exist), and Wiles also proved that the conjecture applied to the special case known as the semistable elliptic curves to which Fermat's equation was tied; in other words, Wiles had found that the Taniyama\u2013Shimura\u2013Weil conjecture was true in the case of Fermat\u2019s equation, and Ribet\u2019s finding, that the conjecture holding for semistable elliptic curves could mean Fermat's Last Theorem is true, prevailed, thus proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem.[22][23][24]/nIn June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. Gina Kolata of The New York Times summed up the presentation as follows:/nHe gave a lecture a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the title \"Modular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations\". There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.[20]/nIn August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in several areas, related to properties of the Selmer group and use of a tool called an Euler system.[25] Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing\u2014rather than closing\u2014this area came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. According to Eric W. Weisstein, the circumvention involved \"replacing elliptic curves with Galois representations, reducing the problem to a class number formula, solving that problem, and tying up loose ends\", all using Iwasawa theory to fix \"results from Matthias Flach based on ideas from Victor Kolyvagin\", and letting Iwasawa's and Flach's approaches strengthen each other.[24][25][26] Together with his former student Richard Taylor, he published a second paper which contained the circumvention and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated issue of the Annals of Mathematics.[27][28]/nWiles\u2019 work has been used in many fields of mathematics. Notably, in 1999, his former student Richard Taylor and three other mathematicians built upon Wiles\u2019 proof to prove the full modularity theorem.[29]/nIn 2016, upon receiving the Abel Prize, Wiles said about his proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, \u201cThe methods that solved it opened up a new way of attacking one of the big webs of conjectures of contemporary mathematics called the Langlands Program, which as a grand vision tries to unify different branches of mathematics. It\u2019s given us a new way to look at that.\u201d[8]/nWiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's other mathematical experts.

It was such a critical method for observing circadian rhythms in plants that the phenomena was dubbed the \"hands of the circadian clock\".[10] However, it was not until Satter's groundbreaking work that the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon were understood./nSatter worked to decipher the structure and function of pulvini, specialized plant motor organs found at the base of leaves and leaflets which allow leaves to extend and fold down. She identified that changes in potassium and chloride ion concentrations in pulvini drive osmotic water flux, or changes in the amount of water in the cell. The pulvini contain two cell types, flexor and extensor cells.[10][11] Satter's work demonstrated that as the flexor gains solutes and thus water to increase their rigidity, the extensor loses ions and water to decrease their rigidity. The coordinated inverse rigidity changes in extensor and flexor induce extension or collapse of the pulvinus to lift and lower leaflets.[11]/nSatter also collaborated with Richard Racusen of the University of Vermont to study circadian changes in pulvini membrane potential.[10] Satter determined that the changes in membrane potential were too quick to be explained by the passive movement of potassium ions reported in her earlier papers.[10] She discovered an energy-consuming proton pump that removes protons (H+) from the cell, facilitating the observed rapid electrical changes as well as potassium ion flux.[10] Thus, Satter and Racusen determined that changes in membrane potential drives the ion flux necessary for circadian leaf movement. Additional experiments observing the pH in both flexor and extensor pulvini cells in different experimental conditions (darkness, white light, red light, and far red light) demonstrated that pH levels in flexor and extensor cells were inversely correlated.[10] From these studies, Satter demonstrated that proton pumps were active in flexor cells in darkness and in extensor cells in light./nSatter additionally unveiled the mechanisms that allow circadian leaf movements to synchronize with (entrain to) light-dark cycles. She showed that phytochromes, a type of plant photopigment, mediate changes in membrane potential of pulvini in response to red and far-red light.[10][12][13]/nPhytochromes have two interconvertible isomeric forms, Pfr and Pr. Red light converts the pulvinus phytochrome to the Pfr form which promotes leaf closing, while exposure to far-red light converts the photopigment to the Pr form and promotes leaf opening.[10] Pfr phytochrome depolarizes the cell membrane by opening potassium ion channels and facilitating potassium ion flow while Pr hyperpolarizes the cell membrane to close the potassium ion channel and prevent ion flow.[10] Over the course of 24 hours, the amount of red and far-red light in the environment changes, so the form of phytochrome in the pulvinus also changes over time, causing the plant leaves to open or close as a result of the environmental light cycle./nSatter also studied other methods of leaf movement entrainment including the effects of blue light. Satter and her colleagues showed that blue light leads to phase shifts in leaf movement in both Samanea saman and Albizia.[10] Satter found that blue light exposure can affect when plant leaves extend and that the timing of blue light exposure determined whether leaves extended earlier or later than expected. While these studies revealed that blue light could advance or delay circadian leaf movement rhythms, the photoreceptor that mediates this response would not be discovered until later.[10]", "362536": "\u00c9mile Picard Medal (1959)\nCNRS Gold Medal (1976)\nWolf Prize (1980)/nHenri Paul Cartan (French: [ka\u0281t\u0251\u0303]; 8 July 1904 \u2013 13 August 2008) was a French mathematician who made substantial contributions to algebraic topology.[1][2][3]/nHe was the son of the mathematician \u00c9lie Cartan, nephew of mathematician Anna Cartan, oldest brother of composer Jean Cartan\u00a0[fr; de], physicist Louis Cartan\u00a0[fr] and mathematician H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cartan\u00a0[fr], and the son-in-law of physicist Pierre Weiss./nAccording to his own words, Henri Cartan was interested in mathematics at a very young age, without being influenced by his family.[4] He moved to Paris with his family after his father's appointment at Sorbonne in 1909 and he attended secondary school at Lyc\u00e9e Hoche in Versailles.[5][6]/nIn 1923 he started studying mathematics at \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, receiving an agr\u00e9gation in 1926 and a doctorate in 1928.[5][6] His PhD thesis, entitled Sur les syst\u00e8mes de fonctions holomorphes a vari\u00e9t\u00e9s lin\u00e9aires lacunaires et leurs applications, was supervised by Paul Montel.[7]/nCartan taught at Lyc\u00e9e Malherbe in Caen from 1928 to 1929, at University of Lille from 1929 to 1931 and at University of Strasbourg from 1931 to 1939.

He discovered iron ores in Pacho and, by order of Antonio Nari\u00f1o, searched for lead mines. Wiesner supported the independence efforts of Colombia for which Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar appointed him General Director of Mines of Zipaquir\u00e1 and Sesquil\u00e9 salt mines. He is also known for directing engineering work to drain the Guatavita lagoon between 1822 and 1823.[2]/nHe was baptized in the parish of Santa Virginia on June 28, 1763, the son of Christian Wiessner and Juana Dorotea Hacker, natives of Freiberg, Germany. He studied mines and metallurgy and graduated from his hometown's renowned university, the Technische Universit\u00e4t Bergakademie Freiberg./nIn 1787, King Charles III of Spain asked the Elector of Saxony for several skilled mineralogists to teach their profession and work in the mines of the New Kingdom of Granada (mainly now part of Colombia). For this reason, eight young men were sent, including Jacob Wiesner./nIn September 1788, they arrived in Cartagena de Indias as professors of mineralogy and went to the Santa Ana silver mines near the city of Mariquita, where the Director General of Mines, Juan Jos\u00e9 D'Elhuyart, employed them in different operations and jobs.[3] At that time, the Baron de Born had discovered in Germany a new method of refining metals with practical applications to separate gold from auriferous silver, and to learn it, the famous Spanish chemist Faustino D'Elhuyart, brother of Juan Jos\u00e9, traveled to that nation; the new arrivals knew the method and began to apply it in mineralogy establishments and the Bogot\u00e1 Mint. Wiesner worked with D'Elhuyart, but the latter died shortly after, and in 1792 he went to Pamplona, where an anonymous company had been formed to exploit the silver mine in that province and a gold mine in Gir\u00f3n, leaving the Santa Ana mine almost abandoned and as it was the one[clarification needed] that provided fine metals to the Bogot\u00e1 Mint, when the cupellation declined, very poor coins began to be manufactured, as Boussingault noted \u2013 years later \u2013 in his famous Memoirs in 1825. In Gir\u00f3n there is the most valuable gold of the world since its law is 996 thousandths.[clarification needed] While Wiesner was working there, on July 1, 1802, he married Ignacia Arriaga y Quesada; they had nine children, establishing the surname and family in South America.[4] The renowned Wiesner family is one of the multiple German families that emigrated to Colombia. By the 19th and 20th centuries, they had established themselves as a prominent family in Zipaquir\u00e1 and in the Colombian aristocracy.[citation needed] His descendants have served the country as government ministers, lawyers, engineers and doctors.[citation needed]/nIn 1797, when the anonymous mining company was dissolved, he went on to work in the silver mines of that same city, which were owned by the royal treasury. There he was found in 1801 by his countryman Baron Alexander von Humboldt, who treated and appreciated him extremely, recommending that the authorities take advantage of his services, especially in the closed Zipaquir\u00e1 rock salt mine that had to be excavated through the tunnel system and in the Memoir he wrote on the subject, Humboldt noted that the German mineralogists lived earning their salaries at Honda but without any occupation and that they could well be employed as Wiesner's assistants. This recommendation was worth a lot, so the government assigned him at the beginning of 1806 to explore and recognize the state of the Zipaquir\u00e1 salt mine. He could start the jobs after the Report, which he presented halfway with Official Carlos J. Urisarri. At the same time, he reviewed the Baja y Veta mine in Sesquil\u00e9 and mapped it, as well as the Muzo emerald mine, where he made valuable observations. In 1814, by order of President Antonio Nari\u00f1o, he explored the Pacho district, discovering several metal mines. Among them is lead in the San Miguel site and copper in Algodonales. Since lead was necessary for Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada , he built a ramada, made a furnace, and smelted lead, sending it to the government. Later he went to other places in search of copper and discovered that there was also a large quantity of iron, he did the tests and obtained small bars of that metal. In 1816 the Spanish regained control of the country until three years later, after the battle of Boyac\u00e1, Simon Bol\u00edvar was free to enter Bogot\u00e1. The Spanish employees of the Zipaquir\u00e1 mines, upon hearing the news of the complete defeat of the king's armies, fled in terror, leaving the office for the sale of salts in the hands of Wiesner with the safe full of money, various belongings, weapons and Valuable objects./nAfter the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 on August 7, Bolivar passed through Zipaquir\u00e1 where Wiesner worked at the mines. The honest German kept such a large deposit intact, and when the Liberator passed through the said population, he presented him with everything he had in his hands, after which, on September 17, he received the appointment of General Director of Mines.[5] Wiesner built underground tunnels to get the purest mineral in the Zipaquir\u00e1 salt flats; he also mapped the Sesquil\u00e9 salt mine.[6]/nBetween 1822 and 1823 he directed the engineering works to drain the Guatavita lagoon through a contract with the businessman Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Par\u00eds. On the 23rd[clarification needed] he returned to Pacho to begin the buildings and establishments of the ironworks factory with the power granted by the governor of the province, Crist\u00f3bal de Vergara Azc\u00e1rate y Caycedo. He built a branch fifty varas long with two rooms at the extremities, made a furnace and melted down iron ore, got sick in one leg, and had to take it in hand to Zipaquir\u00e1, where he was cured. Years later, Vice President Santander gave him the job of Director of the Zipaquir\u00e1 mine and salt factory, where he remained until his retirement. Later he dedicated himself to the manufacture of soaps and candles. The office was inherited by his son Pedro Francisco Wiesner Arriaga, and his grandson Jacobo./nJacob Benjam\u00edn Wiesner would later have a preponderant influence on the origins of the Colombian metal-mechanic workshops of the 19th century, first working in the Mariquita mines, then in those of Pamplona, later in the Zipaquir\u00e1 salt flats, to later be commissioned around 1814 by Antonio Nari\u00f1o to search for lead near Pacho, where he not only found lead but also found rich deposits of iron for the first time./nIn Pacho around 1822, Wiesner would undertake the exploitation of the mineral, installing a medium-sized workshop where he would eventually start the Pacho Forge. With the creation of this workshop, a new course would be given to the history of metal workers in Colombia.[7]/nIn the Pacho forge and later in the Pradera, Samac\u00e1 and Amag\u00e1 forges, Colombian technicians came into contact with the Industrial Revolution. This forge, with Jacob Wiesner and the French engineers who succeeded him, was a practical school for steelmaking, iron chemistry, mineralogy and combustion techniques.[8]", "58755133": "Dionne L.

According to Rosenblum (1994) \"new algorithms are just beginning to effectively handle the recurring scientific problem of data collected at nonuniform intervals. Volume visualization today is being extended from examining scientific data to reconstructing scattered data and representing geometrical objects without mathematically describing surfaces. Fluid dynamics visualization affects numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. It has taken its place with molecular modeling, imaging remote-sensing data, and medical imaging as a domain-specific visualization research area\".[3]/nMuch of the progress in the field of scientific modeling, according to Rosenblum (1994), came \"from using algorithms with roots in both computer graphics and computer vision. One important research thread has been the topological representation of important features. Volume and hybrid visualization now produce 3D animations of complex flows. However, while impressive 3D visualizations have been generated for scalar parameters associated with fluid dynamics, vector and especially tensor portrayal has proven more difficult. Seminal methods have appeared, but much remains to do. Great strides have also occurred in visualization systems. The area of automated selection of visualizations especially requires more work. Nonetheless, the situation has much improved, with these tools increasingly accessible to scientists and engineers\".[3]/nThe field of visualization has undergone considerable changes since its founding in the late 1980s. From its origins in scientific visualization, new areas have arisen in the new Millennium . These include information visualization and, more recently, mobile visualization including location-aware computing, and visual analytics. Several new trends are emerging. The most important is the fusion of visualization techniques with other areas such as computer vision, data mining and data bases to promote broad-based advances. Another trend, which has not been well met to date by visualization researchers, is for algorithms to be combined with usability studies to assure that techniques and systems are well designed and that their value is quantified. This presentation will discuss current research trends in visualization as well as briefly discuss trends in U.S. research funding.[2]/nRosenblum current program responsibilities at the NSF in 2008 is \"Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics (FODAVA)\" project. Those involved with science, engineering, commerce, health, and national security all increasingly face the challenge of synthesizing information and deriving insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous and possibly conflicting digital data. The goal of collecting and examining these data is not to merely acquire information, but to derive increased understanding from it and to facilitate effective decision-making.[4]/nTo capitalize on the opportunities provided by these data sets, a new, interdisciplinary field of science is emerging called \"Data and Visual Analytics\", which is defined as the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. Data and Visual Analytics requires interdisciplinary science, going beyond traditional scientific and information visualization to include statistics, mathematics, knowledge representation, management and discovery technologies, cognitive and perceptual sciences, decision sciences, and more. This solicitation is concerned only with a subset of the overall problem, namely the creation of the mathematical and computational sciences foundations required to transform data in ways that permit visual-based understanding.[4]/nTo facilitate visual-based data exploration, it is necessary to discover new algorithms that will represent and transform all types of digital data into mathematical formulations and computational models that will subsequently enable efficient, effective visualization and analytic reasoning techniques.[4]/nRosenblum has published over eighty scientific articles and has edited two books, including Scientific Visualization: Advances & Challenges.", "38832206": "Roshdi Rashed (Arabic: \u0631\u0634\u062f\u064a \u0631\u0627\u0634\u062f), born in Cairo in 1936, is a mathematician, philosopher and historian of science, whose work focuses largely on mathematics and physics of the medieval Arab world.[citation needed] His work explores and illuminates the unrecognized Arab scientific tradition, being one of the first historians to study in detail the ancient and medieval texts, their journey through the Eastern schools and courses, their immense contributions to Western science, particularly in regarding the development of algebra and the first formalization of physics.[citation needed]/nRoshdi Rashed is the author of several books and scientific articles in History of Science.

He is one of England's strongest chess players and was formerly in the world's top ten.[1][2][3]/nNunn was born in London. As a junior, he showed a prodigious talent for chess and in 1967, at 12 years of age, he won the British under-14 Championship. At 14, he was London Under-18 Champion for the 1969\u201370 season[4] and less than a year later, at just 15 years of age, he proceeded to Oriel College, Oxford, to read Mathematics. At the time, Nunn was Oxford's youngest undergraduate since Cardinal Wolsey in 1520.[5] Graduating in 1973, he went on to gain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1978 with a thesis on finite H-spaces, supervised by John Hubbuck.[6] Nunn remained in Oxford as a mathematics lecturer until 1981, when he became a professional chess player./nIn 1975, he became the European Junior Chess Champion. He gained the Grandmaster title in 1978 and was British champion in 1980. Nunn has twice won individual gold medals at Chess Olympiads. In 1989, he finished sixth in the inaugural 'World Cup', a series of tournaments in which the top 25 players in the world competed. His best performance in the World Chess Championship cycle came in 1987, when he lost a playoff match against Lajos Portisch for a place in the Candidates Tournament. At the prestigious Hoogovens tournament (held annually in Wijk aan Zee) he was a winner in 1982, 1990 and 1991./nNunn achieved his highest Elo rating of 2630 in January 1995. Six years earlier, in January 1989, his then rating of 2620 was high enough to elevate him into the world's top ten, where he shared ninth place. This was close to the peak of the English chess boom, and there were two English players above him on the list: Nigel Short (world number three, 2650) and Jonathan Speelman (world number five, 2640). Nunn has now retired from serious tournament play and, until he resurfaced as a player in two Veterans events in 2014 and 2015, had not played a FIDE-rated game since August 2006;[7] however, he has been active in the ECF rapid play.[8]/nAs well as being a strong player, Nunn is regarded as one of the best contemporary authors of chess books. He has penned many books, including Secrets of Grandmaster Chess, which won the British Chess Federation Book of the Year award in 1988, and John Nunn's Best Games, which took the award in 1995. He is the director of chess publishers Gambit Publications. Chess historian Edward Winter has written of him:[9][10]/nA polymath, Nunn has written authoritative monographs on openings, endings and compositions, as well as annotated games collections and autobiographical volumes. As an annotator he is equally at home presenting lucid prose descriptions for the relative novice and analysis of extreme depth for the expert./nIn a 2010 interview, Magnus Carlsen said he thought extreme intelligence could be a hindrance to one's chess career.[11] As an example of this, he cited Nunn:/nI am convinced that the reason the Englishman John Nunn never became world champion is that he is too clever for that. ... He has so incredibly much in his head. Simply too much. His enormous powers of understanding and his constant thirst for knowledge distracted him from chess./nNunn is also involved with chess problems, composing several examples and solving as part of the British team on several occasions. On this subject he wrote Solving in Style (1985). He won the World Chess Solving Championship in Halkidiki, Greece, in September 2004 and also made his final GM norm in problem solving. There were further wins of the World Solving Championship in 2007[12] and in 2010.[13] He is the third person ever to gain both over-the-board and solving GM titles (the others being Jonathan Mestel and Ram Soffer; Bojan Vu\u010dkovi\u0107 has been the fourth since 2008)./nNunn has long been interested in computer chess.  In 1984, he began annotating games between computers for Personal Computer World magazine, and joined the editorial board of Frederic Friedel's Computerschach & Spiele magazine.  In 1987, he was announced as the first editor of the newly created Chessbase magazine.[14] The 1992 release of his first book making use of chess endgame tablebases, Secrets Of Rook Endings, was later followed by Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings, and Secrets Of Pawnless Endings. These books include human-usable endgame strategies found by Nunn (and others) by extensive experimentation with tablebases, and new editions have come out and are due as more tablebases are created and tablebases are more deeply data-mined. Nunn is thus (as of 2004) the foremost data miner of chess endgame tablebases./nNunn finished third in the World Senior Chess Championship (over-50 section) of 2014 in Katerini, Greece,[15] second in the European Senior Chess Championship (over-50) of 2015 in Eretria, Greece,[16] and first in the World Senior Chess Championship (over-65 section) in Assisi, Italy in 2022.[17] He was the winner again in 2023, at Terrasini./nNunn is married to Petra Fink-Nunn, a German chess player with the title Woman FIDE Master. They have a son, Michael./nCoincident with a reduction in his over-the-board chess, Nunn has developed a passion for astronomy, a hobby he shares with ex-world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.

Together with Jean-Paul Doignon, he developed knowledge space theory, which is the mathematical foundation for the ALEKS software for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, including K-12 mathematics, chemistry, and accounting./nAfter finishing high school, Falmagne spent two years in the Belgian army, where he became an officer.  Military service was mandatory in Belgium at the time.  In 1954, he enrolled at the University of Brussels (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) as a student in the psychology department.  He received his undergraduate degree in 1959 and was hired as an assistant at the University of Brussels, which is a faculty position in the Belgian system.  He obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1965 from the same institution./nWhile working on his doctoral dissertation, which dealt with reaction times, Falmagne became interested in the applications of mathematics to the cognitive sciences.  In 1964, he was invited by Patrick Suppes to spend the summer at Stanford University.  He presented the results of his dissertation at a conference there and met several prominent mathematical psychologists, including Bill Estes, Dick Atkinson, and Duncan Luce, and the mathematician J\u00e1nos Acz\u00e9l.

His interests grew to include psychophysics, measurement theory, and probabilistic models of ordering and algebraic measurement.  After short teaching stints back in Europe at the University of Brussels and the University of Paris, he returned to the United States in 1971 as a Professor of Psychology at New York University./nIn 1989, he joined the faculty of University of California, Irvine, accepting an appointment at the Department of Cognitive Sciences and the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences.

Block and Jacob Marschak in their article \"Random Orderings and Stochastic Theories of Responses\", concerning the representation of choice probabilities by random variables[1] and published his findings in the Journal of Mathematical Psychology.[F78]/nIn 1985, Falmagne, along with Jean-Paul Doignon, wrote \u201cSpaces for the Assessment of Knowledge\u201d.[DF85]  In this article, they presented a formal framework for the assessment of knowledge in various academic subjects, such as arithmetic, algebra, and chemistry.  This early framework was combinatoric in character, and as such insufficient for a practical assessment, which is unavoidably plagued by careless errors on the part of the test takers.  In time, they created a stochastic framework for the description of the evolution of an assessment, question by question.[FD88]  With extensive financial support from the National Science Foundation, their work on the stochastic framework led to the creation of the web-based system ALEKS for the assessment and learning of mathematics and science.  Falmagne and Doignon's 2011 book, Learning Spaces,[FD11] contains the most current presentation and development of the stochastic framework for the assessment of knowledge.  Learning spaces are specific kinds of knowledge spaces, whose best applications are to situations where assessments guide efficient learning.  Learning spaces are a part of the concept of Media Theory,[EFO07] which explores the modeling of knowledge structures and knowledge states.  More generally, these lines of research are collectively called Knowledge Space Theory and are being pursued by many investigators, mostly in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands./nA common practice in the statement of scientific laws ensures that the mathematical expression of the law is invariant with respect to changes of units of its variables\u2014except for the values of dimensional constants. In dimensional analysis, this invariance is implicit and captured by the concept of \"quantities\". In \"Scales and Meaningfulness of Quantitative Laws\", Falmagne and Louis Narens argue that the requirement of invariance, which they call \"meaningfulness\" should be part of the axioms or theory establishing the law, rather than result from them.[FN83] They proposed a more powerful framework making this invariance explicit in the notation.  This approach was generalized by Falmagne in \"Meaningfulness and Order Invariance: Two Fundamental Principles for Scientific Laws\",[F04] and applied to several exemplary laws of physics./nThe monograph Elements of Psychophysical Theory[F85] presents the mathematical foundation of psychophysics and includes an introduction to measurement theory and functional equations.  Falmagne's work in philosophy of science concerns foundational issues in algebraic measurement[DF69][F75] and in probabilistic measurement.[F76]  A distinctive feature of his research lies in the use of functional equations in order to achieve generality.[F80][AF99][AF00][FD10]/nFalmagne is the recipient of Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships and of a von Humboldt Award.

He shared this professorial level at the school with the surveyor and cartographer, Simon Fransz van Merwen\u00a0[nl], which shows that the intention was to promote practical, rather than theoretical instruction./nThe curriculum for the new Engineering School was devised by Simon Stevin who continued to act as the personal advisor to the Prince. At first the professors at Leiden refused to accept the status of Van Ceulen and Van Merwen, especially as they taught in Dutch rather than Latin.  Theological professors generally believed that practical courses were not acceptable studies for a university, but they were not willing to reject the School outright since it was founded by Prince Maurice./nLeiden University governors heard in April 1600 that Adriaan Metius, a fortification advisor to Prince Maurice and the States General, had been recruited and raised to the level of a full professor to teach mathematics at the rival Franeker University.

He sided with the university's efforts to maintain independence from Jesuit dominance. In 1625, he wrote a pamphlet, Gratis, that was critical of the Jesuits. The printer of the pamphlet was arrested, whipped and exiled from Krakow. Bro\u017cek escaped serious punishment only because of his association with the university.

He is believed to be a great-grandson of Jan Popel y Lobkowicz./nJuan Caramuel was born in Madrid in 1606, the son of Count Lorenzo Caramuel and Caterina Frissea von Lobkowitz, a descendant of a Czech noble family.[4] He was instructed in oriental languages by Archbishop Juan de Esron (Ezron). By the age of 17, he was studying at the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, where he took his degree in the humanities and philosophy.[5] His theological teachers at the University of Alcal\u00e1 included the Dominicans John of St. Thomas (Jo\u00e3o Poinsot, 1589\u20131644) and Francisco de Araujo (1580\u20131664) as well as the Cistercian Pedro de Lorca (1521\u20131621)./nHe was a precocious child, early delving into serious problems in mathematics and even publishing astronomical tables at the age of ten, Camuelis primus calamus (Madrid 1617).[6] He studied Chinese. He was received into the Cistercian Order at the monastery of La Espina, in the diocese of Palencia in 1625, and after ordination entered upon a varied and brilliant career. He served in the monastery of Montederramo (diocese of Orense), then Santa Mar\u00eda del Destierro (Salamanca), where he completed his studies. He probably attended the last classes of Agust\u00edn Antol\u00ednez (1554\u20131626), in that time the major theologian of the Augustinian Order in Salamanca. He then taught in houses in Alcal\u00e1, Palazuelos, and Salamanca. He then travelled to Portugal for the sake of studying oriental languages, and from there he moved to the Low Countries (the Spanish Netherlands), where he resided from 1635 to 1644.[7]/nHis sermons attracted the favorable attention of the Infante Ferdinand, Governor of the Low Countries, while he was attached to the monastery of Dunes in Flanders. He assisted Don Ferdinand in the defense of the city of Louvain from the attacks of the French and the Dutch, as engineer and chief of works, for which Don Ferdinand appointed him court preacher. Through Don Ferdinand, Caramuel became friends with Marie de' Medici, the exiled former queen-mother of France (1630\u20131642), who lived in Bruxelles, though she visited her daughter, the queen of England, for a period of three years. Through Marie's influence, Caramuel was appointed Vicar General of the Carthusians in England, Ireland, and Scotland; and named Abbot of Melrose.[8]/nIn 1638 he defended his academic theses with great success, and was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology by the University of Leuven on 2 September 1638.[9] Having learned more of the doctrines of Cornelius Jansen, who had died earlier in that year, Caramuel embarked on a preaching crusade through Belgium and Germany, especially Mainz. An inscription in the cathedral of Vigevano claims he brought some 30,000 persons back to practicing Roman Catholicism.[10]/nCaramuel's patron, the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand, died on 9 November 1641. When he was obliged to leave the Electorate of the Palatinate, Philip IV of Spain made him his envoy to the court of Emperor Ferdinand III whose court was residing in Prague at the time.[11] He was in turn Abbot of Melrose (Scotland), Abbot-Superior of the Benedictines of Vienna, Abbot of the Benedictine Emmaus Monastery in Prague (1647), and Grand-Vicar to the Archbishop of Prague, Ernst Augustus z Harrach (1623\u20131667).[12]/nIn 1648, when the Swedes attacked Prague, Caramuel armed and led a military division of ecclesiastics who helped defend the city. His bravery on this occasion merited for him a collar of gold from the emperor. \"Being active in the political struggles of his time and carrying out the project of re-Catholicisation perhaps too vigorously,\" according to Petr Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, \"he made himself many enemies even within the Catholic camp.\"[13] He soon left Central Europe for Italy./nIn 1656 Caramuel visited Rome for the first time, where Pope Alexander VII named him Consultor of the Holy Office (Inquisition) and Consultor of the Sacred Congregation of Rites.[14] Pope Alexander knew Caramuel well, since he had been papal legate in Cologne from 1639 to 1651. Soon after, on 9 July 1657, he was named Bishop of Campagna e Satrianum (1657\u20131673), a small and poor diocese in the Kingdom of Naples.[15]/nOn 25 July 1673, Caramuel was appointed to the diocese of Vigevano near Milan (1673\u20131682),[16] which he held until his death on 8 September 1682.[17]/nCaramuel was in active correspondence with famous scholars:[18] the philosophers Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Pierre Gassendi; the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher; the Czech Capuchin friar and astronomer Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita, the Bohemian doctor Jan Marek Marci, Pope Alexander VII (Fabio Chigi), who was a great admirer of his work; the Belgian astronomer Godefroy Wendelin, the theologians Franciscus Bonae Spei and Antonino Diana, Giovanni Battista Hodierna, Johannes Hevelius, Valerianus Magnus, Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, and many others./nHis books are even more numerous than his awards and varied achievements. According to Jean-No\u00ebl Paquot,[citation needed] he published no fewer than 262 works on grammar, poetry, oratory, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, physics, politics, canon law, logic, metaphysics, theology, and asceticism./nCaramuel distanced himself from all established philosophical schools of the Baroque era (he often praised Thomas Aquinas but explicitly denied being a Thomist). Although educated in the Thomist tradition, he firmly believed in the humanist ideal of nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri (\u2018not to swear slavishly by the words of any master\u2019). He refused to be enrolled in a specific school of thought and felt free to choose among all the authorities that would best suit his project of constructing a renovated Christian philosophy. He refers this attitude back to Augustine's teaching: \u2018Augustine was no tyrant, since he was the Divine Master\u2019, writes,[19] and reminds that Augustine did not wish to be followed blindly. Augustine gave himself the example of a continuous change and progress of opinion in his numerous Retractationes (cf. Aug.'s reconsideration in persev. 21.55)./nCaramuel loved to defend novel theories, and in Theologia moralis ad prima atque clarissima principia reducta (Leuven, 1643) tried to solve theological problems by mathematical rules. He was a leading exponent of probabilism and his permissive moral opinions were criticized in Pascal's Provincial Letters and gained for him from Alphonsus Liguori the title of \"Prince of the Laxists\".[20]/nHis mathematical work centred on combinatorics and he was one of the early writers on probability, republishing Huygens's work on dice with helpful explanations.[21] Caramuel's Mathesis biceps presents some original contributions to the field of mathematics: he proposed a new method of approximation for trisecting an angle and proposed a form of logarithm that prefigure cologarithms, although he was not understood by his contemporaries.[22] Caramuel was also the first mathematician who made a reasoned study on non-decimal counts, thus making a significant contribution to the development of the binary numeral system.[18]/nThe bishop was also responsible for the design of the fa\u00e7ade of the Vigevano Cathedral, an eclectic design showing some virtuosity in its geometrical relationship to the square.[23]", "49809553": "Francesco Perez was an 18th-century Italian abbot and mathematician, whose work Tri-lichanon goni-arith-metron, describing a goniometer (instrument for measurement of angles), was published in 1781.[1] He later published a letter complaining about the \"plagiarizing usurpation\" of this invention by Eliseo della Concezione.[2][3]/n/nThis article about an Italian mathematician is a stub.

His employer, William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, in a letter to Tycho Brahe praised B\u00fcrgi as a \"second Archimedes\" (quasi indagine Archimedes alter est).[2]\nAnother autodidact, Nicolaus Reimers, in 1587 translated Copernicus' De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium into German for B\u00fcrgi. A copy of the translation survived in Graz, it is thus called \"Grazer Handschrift\".[3][4][5]/nIn 1604, he entered the service of emperor Rudolf II in Prague. Here, he befriended Johannes Kepler. B\u00fcrgi constructed a table of sines (Canon Sinuum), which was supposedly very accurate, but since the table itself is lost, it is difficult to be sure of its real accuracy (for instance, Valentinus Otho's Opus Palatinum had parts which were not as accurate as it was claimed). An introduction to some of Buergi's methods survives in a copy by Kepler; it discusses the basics of Algebra (or Coss as it was known at the time), and of decimal fractions. Some authors consider B\u00fcrgi as one of the inventors of logarithms.[6]  His legacy also includes the engineering achievement contained in his  innovative mechanical astronomical models.[7] During his years in Prague he worked closely with the astronomer Johannes Kepler at the court of Rudolf II.[8]/nIt is undocumented where he learned his clockmaking skills, but eventually he became the most innovative clock and scientific instrument maker of his time.[9][10] Among his major horological inventions were the cross-beat escapement, and the remontoire, two mechanisms which improved the accuracy of mechanical clocks of the time by orders of magnitude.  This allowed for the first time clocks to be used as scientific instruments, with enough accuracy to time the passing of stars (and other heavenly bodies) in the crosshairs of telescopes to start accurately charting stellar positions.[11]/nWorking as an instrument maker for the court of William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in Kassel[12] he played a pivotal role in developing the first astronomical charts.  He invented logarithms as a working tool for himself for his astronomical calculations, but as a \"craftsman/scholar\" rather than a \"book scholar\" he failed to publish his invention for a long time.[7]/nIn 1592, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague received from his uncle, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, a B\u00fcrgi globe and insisted that B\u00fcrgi deliver it personally. From then on B\u00fcrgi commuted between Kassel and Prague, and finally entered the service of the emperor in 1604 to work for the imperial astronomer Johannes Kepler.[13]/nThe most significant artifacts designed and built by B\u00fcrgi surviving in museums are:[14]/nBy 1586, B\u00fcrgi was able to calculate sines at arbitrary precision, using several algorithms, one of which he called Kunstweg. He supposedly used these algorithms to calculate a \u00abCanon Sinuum\u00bb, a table of sines to 8 places in steps of 2 arc seconds. Nothing more is known on this table, and some authors have speculated that its range was only over 45 degrees. Such tables were extremely important for navigation at sea. Johannes Kepler called the Canon Sinuum the most precise known table of sines.  B\u00fcrgi explained his algorithms in his work Fundamentum Astronomiae which he presented to Emperor Rudolf II in 1592.[15]/nIterative table calculation through B\u00fcrgi's algorithm essentially works as follows: cells sum up the values of the two previous cells in the same column. The final cell's value is divided by two, and the next iteration starts. Finally, the values of the last column get normalized. Rather accurate approximations of sines are obtained after few iterations. Only recently, Folkerts et al. proved that this simple process converges indeed towards the true sines.[6] Another of Buergi's algorithms uses differences in order to build up a table, and this was an anticipation of the famous Tables du cadastre.[16]/nB\u00fcrgi constructed a table of progressions what is now understood as antilogarithms[17] independently of John Napier, through a method distinct from Napier's. Napier published his discovery in 1614, and this publication was widely disseminated in Europe by the time B\u00fcrgi published at the behest of Johannes Kepler. B\u00fcrgi may have constructed his table of progressions around 1600, but B\u00fcrgi's work is not a theoretical basis for logarithms, although his table serves the same purpose as Napier's. One source claims that B\u00fcrgi did not develop a clear notion of a logarithmic function and can therefore not be viewed as an inventor of logarithms.[18] \nB\u00fcrgi's method is different from that of Napier and was clearly invented independently. Kepler wrote about B\u00fcrgi's logarithms in the introduction to his Rudolphine Tables (1627): \"... as aids to calculation Justus Byrgius was led to these very logarithms many years before Napier's system appeared; but being an indolent man, and very uncommunicative, instead of rearing up his child for the public benefit he deserted it at birth.\"[19]/nThe lunar crater Byrgius is named in B\u00fcrgi's honor.", "3934357": "Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r (or Leopold Fej\u00e9r, Hungarian pronunciation: [\u02c8f\u025bje\u02d0r]; 9 February 1880 \u2013 15 October 1959) was a Hungarian mathematician of Jewish heritage. Fej\u00e9r was born Leopold Weisz,[1][2][3] and changed to the Hungarian name Fej\u00e9r[4] around 1900./nHe was born in P\u00e9cs, Austria-Hungary, into the Jewish family of Victoria Goldberger and Samuel Weiss. His maternal great-grandfather Samuel Nachod was a doctor and his grandfather was a renowned scholar, author of a Hebrew-Hungarian dictionary. Leopold's father, Samuel Weiss, was a shopkeeper in Pecs. In primary schools Leopold was not doing well, so for a while his father took him away to home schooling. The future scientist developed his interest in mathematics in high school thanks to his teacher Sigismund Maksay.[5][6]/nFej\u00e9r studied mathematics and physics at the University of Budapest and at the University of Berlin, where he was taught by Hermann Schwarz.  In 1902 he earned his doctorate from University of Budapest (today E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University). From 1902 to 1905 Fej\u00e9r taught there and from 1905 until 1911 he taught at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsv\u00e1r in Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania). In 1911 Fej\u00e9r was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Budapest and he held that post until his death. He was elected corresponding member (1908), member (1930) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences./nDuring his period in the chair at Budapest Fej\u00e9r led a highly successful Hungarian school of analysis. He was the thesis advisor of mathematicians such as John von Neumann, Paul Erd\u0151s, George P\u00f3lya and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n. Thanks to Feuer, Hungary has developed a strong mathematical school: he has educated a new generation of students who have gone on to become eminent scientists. As Poya recalled, a large number of them became interested in mathematics thanks to Fej\u00e9r, his fascinating personality and charisma. Fej\u00e9r gave short (no more than an hour) but very entertaining lectures and often sat with students in caf\u00e9s, discussing mathematical problems and telling stories from his life and how he interacted with the world's leading mathematicians.[7][8]/nFej\u00e9r's research concentrated on harmonic analysis and, in particular, Fourier series.[8]/nFej\u00e9r collaborated to produce important papers, one with Carath\u00e9odory on entire functions in 1907 and another major work with Frigyes Riesz in 1922 on conformal mappings (specifically, a short proof of the Riemann mapping theorem)./nIn 1944, Fej\u00e9r was forced to resign because of his Jewish background. One night at the end of December 1944, members of the Arrow Cross Party stormed into his house. Fej\u00e9r and all the residents of his house were convoyed to the banks of the Danube and were about to be shot, but were miraculously saved by a phone call \"from a brave officer\". Fej\u00e9r was later found in a hospital in the city, where he was admitted \"under unexplained circumstances\". This severe trauma left a permanent mark on the scientist's mental faculties, something even he himself noticed and later often said of himself \"since I became an idiot\".[6] Still, according to his colleagues, he kept on an even keel until mid-1950s, when he became senile.[7]/nLip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r died in Budapest on 15 October 1959. His grave is in the distinguished Kerepesi Cemetery.[9]/nIf you could see him in his rather Bohemian attire (which was, I suspect, carefully chosen) you would find him very eccentric. Yet he would not appear so in his natural habitat, in a certain section of Budapest middle-class society, many members of which had the same manners, if not quite the same mannerisms, as Fej\u00e9r \u2014 there he would appear about half eccentric./nP\u00f3lya writes the following about Fej\u00e9r, telling us much about his personality:[10]/nHe had artistic tastes. He deeply loved music and was a good pianist. He liked a well-turned phrase. 'As to earning a living', he said, 'a professor's salary is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition.' Once he was very angry with a colleague who happened to be a topologist, and explaining the case at length he wound up by declaring '... and what he is saying is a topological mapping of the truth'.\n\nHe had a quick eye for foibles and miseries; in seemingly dull situations he noticed points that were unexpectedly funny or unexpectedly pathetic. He carefully cultivated his talent of raconteur; when he told, with his characteristic gestures, of the little shortcomings of a certain great mathematician, he was irresistible. The hours spent in continental coffee houses with Fej\u00e9r discussing mathematics and telling stories are a cherished recollection for many of us. Fej\u00e9r presented his mathematical remarks with the same verve as his stories, and this may have helped him in winning the lasting interest of so many younger men in his problems./nIn the same article P\u00f3lya writes about Fej\u00e9r's style of mathematics:/nFej\u00e9r talked about a paper he was about to write up. 'When I write a paper,' he said, 'I have to rederive for myself the rules of differentiation and sometimes even the commutative law of multiplication.' These words stuck in my memory and years later I came to think that they expressed an essential aspect of Fej\u00e9r's mathematical talent; his love for the intuitively clear detail.\n\nIt was not given to him to solve very difficult problems or to build vast conceptual structures. Yet he could perceive the significance, the beauty, and the promise of a rather concrete not too large problem, foresee the possibility of a solution and work at it with intensity. And, when he had found the solution, he kept on working at it with loving care, till each detail became fully transparent.\n\nIt is due to such care spent on the elaboration of the solution that Fej\u00e9r's papers are very clearly written, and easy to read and most of his proofs appear very clear and simple. Yet only the very naive may think that it is easy to write a paper that is easy to read, or that it is a simple thing to point out a significant problem that is capable of a simple solution./nMikol\u00e1s, Mikl\u00f3s (1970\u20131980). \"Fej\u00e9r, Lip\u00f3t\".

He was a pioneer in the development of astronomical photometry: the first-ever celestial photometric measurements were made using photovoltaic cells that he developed for the purpose. He invented the absolute sine-electrometer and was a prolific author of mathematical and scientific textbooks and papers./nHe was born George Minchin Smith on 25 May 1845 on Valentia Island, County Kerry, Ireland to George Smith and Alice Minchin.[1] His mother died when he was nine years old. His father, an attorney who lived in Donnybrook, Dublin, placed him into the care of his uncle (by marriage) on his mother's side, David Bell. A literary scholar, Bell ran a school in Dublin and was uncle to another pupil at the school, one Alexander Graham Bell. Minchin's notable mathematical ability was encouraged./nHe entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1862, matriculating under the name George Minchin Smith, and won the first university scholarship in mathematics in 1865, and the Lloyd exhibition in mathematics.  In 1866, he graduated, still as G. M. Smith, with a Gold Medal in mathematics. By then he had assumed the name George Minchin Minchin, receiving his MA in 1870, under the new name, and then Madden's Premium in both 1871 and 1872 for his performance in the Fellowship examinations.[2][3][4]/nThe Smiths were a Protestant family. George Minchin Smith changed his name to George Minchin Minchin evidently because his father had converted to Roman Catholicism and married a Catholic, Marie O\u2019Neill, possibly his housekeeper, with whom he already had three children.\n[5]/nIn 1887 Minchin married Emma Fawcett of Lecarrow (or Strandhill), County Leitrim. They had two children, George Robert Neville in 1888 and Una Eleanor in 1890. [George junior became an engineer and later the managing director of Peto & Radford (accumulator manufacturers) and the Chloride battery company.][6][7][8][2]/nIn 1875 Minchin became the Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College (aka Coopers Hill or R.I.E. College) on the outskirts of London, and the same year he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. As a lecturer at RIEC, he was described as \"brilliant\", much admired for his wit and ability to draw in pupils and colleagues alike with otherwise dull topics. He maintained a regular correspondence, particularly with George Francis FitzGerald. Minchin wrote many mathematical and scientific texts and his clarity of exposition was lauded; he wrote and lectured about the importance of using clear English when producing texts for students. He also encouraged using \"a touch of humour,\" citing the work of George Salmon and James Clerk Maxwell as exemplars. He wrote humorous works including comical mathematical poems.[9][10] He has been credited with introducing the term 'potential function' with reference to applications in physics and engineering, but \nGeorge Green had in fact done so as early as 1828.[11] He was noted for being one of the College's best tennis players (he had also been a cricketer). He loved birds and birdwatching and kept a few in cages in his rooms.[4][2][3]/nMinchin performed early experiments with radio waves, x-rays and photoelectricity, both at RIEC and University College London (in the latter at the new laboratory of George Carey Foster, from 1875). Experiments included coating platinum with light-sensitive dyes, a technique he developed until he was able to detect \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) in his \"impulsion cell\", and he suspected that the Branly's tube with iron filings which detected the waves operated similarly. The sensitivity of Minchin's photo-electric cell apparatus was tested through a number of thick walls and outside as far as the woods at the edge of the RIEC lawn. A light switch was successfully operated remotely. Oliver Lodge read Minchin's paper, The Action of Electromagnetic Radiation on Films containing Metallic Powders, and developed an improved 'Branly' tube that he named a coherer. In his publication Signalling Across Space Without Wires, Lodge tabled Branly's filings, Minchins impulsion cell and his own (and David Edward Hughes's) coherer as \"microphonic\" radiation detectors (the others being mechanical, electrical, thermal, chemical and physiological). One year later Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated wireless telegraphy with the usage of a coherer.[12][13][4][2][14]/nIn 1877, Minchin began work on using photoelectricity with a view to transmitting images. Four years earlier, Willoughby Smith had discovered the photoelectric effect on selenium rods; Minchin became skilled at creating photovoltaic cells made from selenium. His idea was to have a bundle of many insulated wires in parallel, their ends light-sensitised with selenium to detect an image, and for the far ends to emit a proportional level of light registered by a photographic film, effectively as pixels. The efforts were unsuccessful.[4][2]/nContinuing his work, Minchin developed a selenium photocathode on an aluminium base which was immersed in acetone. He complained that some scientists rejected the worthiness of experimentation with photoelectricity out of ignorance, a situation he described as \"madness.\" He was the most insightful of 19th century experimenters in suggesting that photocells transformed energy without being changed themselves. He also made the key point that one should not assume surfaces need to be black to absorb usefully the most energy and that undiscovered surface properties might absorb visible light or other unknown wavelengths better, so scientists could not comment on the efficacy of light-sensitive cells without further scientific testing. These posited differences in energy were in fact later identified through the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein.[15]/nKeen to test his new cells, in late 1891 Minchin contacted a friend \u2014 William Monck \u2013 who had built an observatory with a 7.5 inch (19\u00a0cm) refractor at his home in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. For the experiment, Monck ordered a new quadrant electrometer after FitzGerald was unable to provide a suitable one. The following August, Minchin provided Monck with improved cells but returned to England because of bad weather. More clement conditions on the morning of 28 August enabled Monck and his neighbour Stephen Dixon to measure the \"striking\" effect of the Moon and the relative brightness of Venus and Jupiter, the first photometric measurements in the history of astronomy. The measurements of stars were uncertain, however.[2][4]/nMinchin met William Wilson in London and the latter invited him to try his cells at the new observatory at his home, Daramona House, County Westmeath. In April 1895, Wilson and Minchin operated the 2-foot (60\u00a0cm) reflector, and FitzGerald the galvanometer below. Minchin published the results of a few days' observations in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, describing the relative magnitudes of the stars Regulus, Arcturus and Procyon, and acknowledging Monck's measurements. It is believed he visited Wilson's home in 1894 and 1897, and he certainly did in September 1895 and January 1896, but no other observations were recorded.[4][2]/nMinchin invented a metrological device, the absolute sine-electrometer, a very sensitive development of the gold-leaf electroscope; this device was further developed and marketed as a 'tilted gold-leaf electrometer' by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, amongst others.[4][2]/nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1895.[4]/nHe resisted his colleagues' and students' entreaties to scale up his experiments to create something of practical usage, preferring his work to be considered as purely for learning. RIEC closed in 1906 and he moved to New College, Oxford because of its laboratories and telescopes.[4]/nHe died on 23 March 1914, survived by his wife and children./nSome publications ran to several editions, continuing until at least 1924.[16][17]", "47548645": "David F.

Similarly, the fact that several commentaries on the Aryabhatiya have come from Kerala has been used to suggest that it was Aryabhata's main place of life and activity; however, many commentaries have come from outside Kerala, and the Aryasiddhanta was completely unknown in Kerala.[9] K. Chandra Hari has argued for the Kerala hypothesis on the basis of astronomical evidence.[12]/nAryabhata mentions \"Lanka\" on several occasions in the Aryabhatiya, but his \"Lanka\" is an abstraction, standing for a point on the equator at the same longitude as his Ujjayini.[13]/nIt is fairly certain that, at some point, he went to Kusumapura for advanced studies and lived there for some time.[14] Both Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as Bh\u0101skara I (CE 629), identify Kusumapura as P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, modern Patna.[9] A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (kulapa) at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time and had an astronomical observatory, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well.[9] Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar.[15]/nAryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost./nHe was student of Nalanda University, later becoming head of a department. Much of the research made at Nalanda included subjects in astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine,  and other fields. Aryabhata received his major source of knowledge from Nalanda and his major work were based on previous discoveries by Greeks, Mesapotamians, and Nalanda University itself. Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines./nThe Arya-siddhanta, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I. This work appears to be based on the older Surya Siddhanta which was a Sanskrit summary of Greek and mesapotamian theories in astronomy and mathematics and uses the midnight-day reckoning, as opposed to sunrise in Aryabhatiya. It also contained a description of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon (shanku-yantra), a shadow instrument (chhAyA-yantra), possibly angle-measuring devices, semicircular and circular (dhanur-yantra / chakra-yantra), a cylindrical stick yasti-yantra, an umbrella-shaped device called the chhatra-yantra, and water clocks of at least two types, bow-shaped and cylindrical.[10]/nA third text, which may have survived in the Arabic translation, is Al ntf or Al-nanf. It claims that it is a translation by Aryabhata, but the Sanskrit name of this work is not known. Probably dating from the 9th century, it is mentioned by the Persian scholar and chronicler of India, Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b.[10]/nDirect details of Aryabhata's work are known only from the Aryabhatiya. The name \"Aryabhatiya\" is due to later commentators. Aryabhata himself may not have given it a name. His disciple Bhaskara I calls it Ashmakatantra (or the treatise from the Ashmaka). It is also occasionally referred to as Arya-shatas-aShTa (literally, Aryabhata's 108), because there are 108 verses in the text. It is written in the very terse style typical of sutra literature, in which each line is an aid to memory for a complex system. Thus, the explication of meaning is due to commentators. The text consists of the 108 verses and 13 introductory verses, and is divided into four p\u0101das or chapters:/nThe Aryabhatiya presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple Bhaskara I (Bhashya, c.\u00a0600\u00a0CE) and by Nilakantha Somayaji in his Aryabhatiya Bhasya (1465\u00a0CE)./nAryabhatiya is also well-known for his description of relativity of motion. He expressed this relativity thus: \"Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects (on the shore) as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people on earth as moving exactly towards the west.\"[8]/nThe place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in his work. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.[16]/nHowever, Aryabhata did not use the Brahmi numerals. Continuing the Sanskritic tradition from Vedic times, he used letters of the alphabet to denote numbers, expressing quantities, such as the table of sines in a mnemonic form.[17]/nAryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (\u03c0), and may have come to the conclusion that \u03c0 is irrational.

By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.\"[18]/nThis implies that for a circle whose diameter is 20000, the circumference will be 62832/ni.e,   \n\n\n\n\u03c0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\pi }\n\n = \n\n\n\n\n62832\n\n20000\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 62832 \\over 20000}\n\n =  \n\n\n\n3.1416\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 3.1416}\n\n, which is accurate to two parts in one million.[19]/nIt is speculated that Aryabhata used the word \u0101sanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational). If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, because the irrationality of pi (\u03c0) was proved in Europe only in 1761 by Lambert.[20]/nAfter Aryabhatiya was translated into Arabic (c.\u00a0820\u00a0CE), this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra.[10]/nIn Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as/nthat translates to: \"for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area.\"[21]/nAryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means \"half-chord\". For simplicity, people started calling it jya. When Arabic writers translated his works from Sanskrit into Arabic, they referred it as jiba. However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as jb. Later writers substituted it with jaib, meaning \"pocket\" or \"fold (in a garment)\". (In Arabic, jiba is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic jaib with its Latin counterpart, sinus, which means \"cove\" or \"bay\"; thence comes the English word sine.[22]/nA problem of great interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c. (This problem was also studied in ancient Chinese mathematics, and its solution is usually referred to as the Chinese remainder theorem.) This is an example from Bh\u0101skara's commentary on Aryabhatiya:/nThat is, find N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85. In general, diophantine equations, such as this, can be notoriously difficult. They were discussed extensively in ancient Vedic text Sulba Sutras, whose more ancient parts might date to 800\u00a0BCE. Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621\u00a0CE, is called the ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka (\u0915\u0941\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0915) method. Ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka means \"pulverizing\" or \"breaking into small pieces\", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was called ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka-ga\u1e47ita or simply ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka.[23]/nIn Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes:[24]/nand/nAryabhata's system of astronomy was called the audAyaka system, in which days are reckoned from uday, dawn at lanka or \"equator\". Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model (or ardha-rAtrikA, midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka. In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the Earth's rotation. He may have believed that the planet's orbits as elliptical rather than circular.[25][26]/nAryabhata correctly insisted that the Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view, that the sky rotated.[19] This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives the number of rotations of the Earth in a yuga,[27] and made more explicit in his gola chapter:[28]/nIn the same way that someone in a boat going forward sees an unmoving [object] going backward, so [someone] on the equator sees the unmoving stars going uniformly westward. The cause of rising and setting [is that] the sphere of the stars together with the planets [apparently?] turns due west at the equator, constantly pushed by the cosmic wind./nAryabhata described a geocentric model of the Solar System, in which the\nSun and Moon are each carried by epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the Pait\u0101mahasiddh\u0101nta (c.\u00a0425\u00a0CE), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller manda (slow) and a larger \u015b\u012bghra (fast).[29] The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the asterisms.[10]/nThe positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet's motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two-epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy.[30] Another element in Aryabhata's model, the \u015b\u012bghrocca, the basic planetary period in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying heliocentric model.[31]/nSolar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu (identified as the pseudo-planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Thus, the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth's shadow (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the size and extent of the Earth's shadow (verses gola.38\u201348) and then provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the core. His computational paradigm was so accurate that 18th-century scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30\u00a0August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds.[10]/nConsidered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the sidereal rotation (the rotation of the earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds;[32] the modern value is 23:56:4.091. Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds (365.25858 days)[33] is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).[34]/nAs mentioned, Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model also gave corrections (the \u015b\u012bgra anomaly) for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean speed of the Sun. Thus, it has been suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on an underlying heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun,[35][36][37] though this has been rebutted.[38] It has also been suggested that aspects of Aryabhata's system may have been derived from an earlier, likely pre-Ptolemaic Greek, heliocentric model of which Indian astronomers were unaware,[39] though the evidence is scant.[40] The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata's system was not explicitly heliocentric.[41]/nAryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age (c.\u00a0820\u00a0CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis./nHis definitions of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), versine (utkrama-jya),\nand inverse sine (otkram jya) influenced the birth of trigonometry. He was also the first to specify sine and versine (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0cos\u00a0x) tables, in 3.75\u00b0 intervals from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places./nIn fact, modern names \"sine\" and \"cosine\" are mistranscriptions of the words jya and kojya as introduced by Aryabhata. As mentioned, they were translated as jiba and kojiba in Arabic and then misunderstood by Gerard of Cremona while translating an Arabic geometry text to Latin. He assumed that jiba was the Arabic word jaib, which means \"fold in a garment\", L. sinus (c. 1150).[42]/nAryabhata's astronomical calculation methods were also very influential.\nAlong with the trigonometric tables, they came to be widely used in the Islamic world and used to compute many Arabic astronomical tables (zijes). In particular, the astronomical tables in the work of the Arabic Spain scientist Al-Zarqali (11th century) were translated into Latin as the Tables of Toledo (12th century) and remained the most accurate ephemeris used in Europe for centuries./nCalendric calculations devised by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for the practical purposes of fixing the Panchangam (the Hindu calendar). In the Islamic world, they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar introduced in 1073\u00a0CE by a group of astronomers including Omar Khayyam,[43] versions of which (modified in 1925) are the national calendars in use in Iran and Afghanistan today. The dates of the Jalali calendar are based on actual solar transit, as in Aryabhata and earlier Siddhanta calendars. This type of calendar requires an ephemeris for calculating dates. Although dates were difficult to compute, seasonal errors were less in the Jalali calendar than in the Gregorian calendar.[citation needed]/nAryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU), Patna has been established by Government of Bihar for the development and management of educational infrastructure related to technical, medical, management and allied professional education in his honour.  The university is governed by Bihar State University Act 2008./nIndia's first satellite Aryabhata and the lunar crater Aryabhata are both named in his honour, the Aryabhata satellite also featured on the reverse of the Indian 2-rupee note. An Institute for conducting research in astronomy, astrophysics and atmospheric sciences is the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) near Nainital, India. The inter-school Aryabhata Maths Competition is also named after him,[44] as is Bacillus aryabhata, a species of bacteria discovered in the stratosphere by ISRO scientists in 2009.[45][46]/n\"He believes that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight, incredibly he believes that the orbits of the planets are ellipses.\"", "297206": "Brahmagupta  (c.\u2009598 \u2013 c.\u2009668 CE) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. He is the author of two early works on mathematics and astronomy: the Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta (BSS, \"correctly established doctrine of Brahma\", dated 628), a theoretical treatise, and the Kha\u1e47\u1e0dakh\u0101dyaka (\"edible bite\", dated 665), a more practical text./nIn 628 CE, Brahmagupta first described gravity as an attractive force, and used the term \"gurutv\u0101kar\u1e63a\u1e47am (\u0917\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0923\u092e\u094d)\" in Sanskrit to describe it.[1][2][3][4]/nBrahmagupta is credited with first clear description of the quadratic formula (the solution of the quadratic equation)[5] in his main work, the Br\u0101hma-sphu\u1e6da-siddh\u0101nta.[6]/nBrahmagupta, according to his own statement, was born in 598 CE. Born in Bhillam\u0101la in Gurjaradesa[7] (modern Bhinmal in Rajasthan, India) during the reign of the Chavda dynasty ruler Vyagrahamukha, his ancestors were probably from Sindh.[8][9] He was the son of Jishnugupta and was a Hindu by religion, in particular, a  Shaivite.[10] He lived and worked there for a good part of his life. Prithudaka Svamin, a later commentator, called him Bhillamalacharya, the teacher from Bhillamala.[11]/nBhillamala was the capital of the Gurjaradesa, the second-largest kingdom of Western India, comprising southern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat in modern-day India. It was also a centre of learning for mathematics and astronomy. He became an astronomer of the Brahmapaksha school, one of the four major schools of Indian astronomy during this period. He studied the five traditional Siddhantas on Indian astronomy as well as the work of other astronomers including Aryabhata I, Latadeva, Pradyumna, Varahamihira, Simha, Srisena, Vijayanandin and Vishnuchandra. [11]/nIn the year 628, at the age of 30, he composed the Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta (\"improved treatise of Brahma\") which is believed to be a revised version of the received Siddhanta of the Brahmapaksha school of astronomy. Scholars state that he incorporated a great deal of originality into his revision, adding a considerable amount of new material. The book consists of 24 chapters with 1008 verses in the \u0101rya metre. A good deal of it is astronomy, but it also contains key chapters on mathematics, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry and algorithmics, which are believed to contain new insights due to Brahmagupta himself.[11][12][13]/nLater, Brahmagupta moved to Ujjaini, Avanti,[14] a major centre for astronomy in central India. At the age of 67, he composed his next well-known work Khanda-kh\u0101dyaka, a practical manual of Indian astronomy in the karana category meant to be used by students.[14]/nBrahmagupta died in 668 CE, and he is presumed to have died in Ujjain./nBrahmagupta composed the following treatises:/nBrahmagupta's mathematical advances were carried on further by Bh\u0101skara II, a lineal descendant in Ujjain, who described Brahmagupta as the ganaka-chakra-chudamani (the gem of the circle of mathematicians). Prithudaka Svamin wrote commentaries on both of his works, rendering difficult verses into simpler language and adding illustrations. Lalla and Bhattotpala in the 8th and 9th centuries wrote commentaries on the Khanda-khadyaka.[16] Further commentaries continued to be written into the 12th century.[14]/nA few decades after the death of Brahmagupta, Sindh came under the Arab Caliphate in 712 CE. Expeditions were sent into Gurjaradesa (\"Al-Baylaman in Jurz\", as per Arab historians). The kingdom of Bhillamala seems to have been annihilated but Ujjain repulsed the attacks. The court of Caliph Al-Mansur (754\u2013775) received an embassy from Sindh, including an astrologer called Kanaka, who brought (possibly memorised) astronomical texts, including those of Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta's texts were translated into Arabic by Muhammad al-Fazari, an astronomer in Al-Mansur's court ,under the names Sindhind and Arakhand. An immediate outcome was the spread of the decimal number system used in the texts. The mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (800\u2013850 CE) wrote a text called al-Jam wal-tafriq bi hisal-al-Hind (Addition and Subtraction in Indian Arithmetic), which was translated into Latin in the 13th century as Algorithmi de numero indorum. Through these texts, the decimal number system and Brahmagupta's algorithms for arithmetic have spread throughout the world. Al-Khwarizmi also wrote his own version of Sindhind, drawing on Al-Fazari's version and incorporating Ptolemaic elements. Indian astronomic material circulated widely for centuries, even making its way into medieval Latin texts.[17][18][19]/nThe historian of science George Sarton called Brahmagupta \"one of the greatest scientists of his race and the greatest of his time.\"[14]/nBrahmagupta gave the solution of the general linear equation in chapter eighteen of Brahmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta,/nThe difference between rupas, when inverted and divided by the difference of the [coefficients] of the [unknowns], is the unknown in the equation. The rupas are [subtracted on the side] below that from which the square and the unknown are to be subtracted.[20]/nwhich is a solution for the equation bx + c = dx + e where rupas refers to the constants c and e. The solution given is equivalent to x = e \u2212 c/b \u2212 d./nHe further gave two equivalent solutions to the general quadratic equation/n18.44. Diminish by the middle [number] the square-root of the rupas multiplied by four times the square and increased by the square of the middle [number]; divide the remainder by twice the square. [The result is] the middle [number].\n18.45. Whatever is the square-root of the rupas multiplied by the square [and] increased by the square of half the unknown, diminished that by half the unknown [and] divide [the remainder] by its square. [The result is] the unknown.[20]/nwhich are, respectively, solutions for the equation ax2 + bx = c equivalent to,/nand/nHe went on to solve systems of simultaneous indeterminate equations stating that the desired variable must first be isolated, and then the equation must be divided by the desired variable's coefficient. In particular, he recommended using \"the pulverizer\" to solve equations with multiple unknowns./n18.51. Subtract the colors different from the first color. [The remainder] divided by the first [color's coefficient] is the measure of the first. [Terms] two by two [are] considered [when reduced to] similar divisors, [and so on] repeatedly. If there are many [colors], the pulverizer [is to be used].[20]/nLike the algebra of Diophantus, the algebra of Brahmagupta was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.[21] The extent of Greek influence on this syncopation, if any, is not known and it is possible that both Greek and Indian syncopation may be derived from a common Babylonian source.[21]/nThe four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) were known to many cultures before Brahmagupta. This current system is based on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and first appeared in the Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta. Brahmagupta describes multiplication in the following way:/nThe multiplicand is repeated like a string for cattle, as often as there are integrant portions in the multiplier and is repeatedly multiplied by them and the products are added together. It is multiplication. Or the multiplicand is repeated as many times as there are component parts in the multiplier.[22]/nIndian arithmetic was known in Medieval Europe as modus Indorum meaning \"method of the Indians\". In the Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, four methods for multiplication were described, including gom\u016btrik\u0101, which is said to be close to the present day methods.[23] In the beginning of chapter twelve of his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, entitled \"Calculation\", he also details operations on fractions. The reader is expected to know the basic arithmetic operations as far as taking the square root, although he explains how to find the cube and cube-root of an integer and later gives rules facilitating the computation of squares and square roots. He then gives rules for dealing with five types of combinations of fractions: a/c + b/c; a/c \u00d7 b/d; a/1 + b/d; a/c + b/d \u00d7 a/c = a(d + b)/cd; and a/c \u2212 b/d \u00d7 a/c = a(d \u2212 b)/cd.[24]/nBrahmagupta then goes on to give the sum of the squares and cubes of the first n integers./n12.20. The sum of the squares is that [sum] multiplied by twice the [number of] step[s] increased by one [and] divided by three. The sum of the cubes is the square of that [sum] Piles of these with identical balls [can also be computed].[25]/nHere Brahmagupta found the result in terms of the sum of the first n integers, rather than in terms of n as is the modern practice.[26]/nHe gives the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers as n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers as (n(n + 1)/2)2./nBrahmagupta's Brahmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta is the first book that provides rules for arithmetic manipulations that apply to zero and to negative numbers.[27] The Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans. In chapter eighteen of his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, Brahmagupta describes operations on negative numbers. He first describes addition and subtraction,/n18.30. [The sum] of two positives is positives, of two negatives negative; of a positive and a negative [the sum] is their difference; if they are equal it is zero. The sum of a negative and zero is negative, [that] of a positive and zero positives, [and that] of two zeros zero./n[...]/n18.32. A negative minus zero is negative, a positive [minus zero] is positive; zero [minus zero] is zero. When a positive is to be subtracted from a negative or a negative from a positive, then it is to be added.[20]/nHe goes on to describe multiplication,/n18.33. The product of a negative and a positive is negative, of two negatives positive, and of positives positive; the product of zero and a negative, of zero and a positive, or of two zeros is zero.[20]/nBut his description of division by zero differs from our modern understanding:/n18.34. A positive divided by a positive or a negative divided by a negative is positive; a zero divided by zero is zero; a positive divided by a negative is negative; a negative divided by a positive is [also] negative.\n18.35. A negative or a positive divided by zero has that [zero] as its divisor, or zero divided by a negative or a positive [has that negative or positive as its divisor]. The square of a negative or positive is positive; [the square] of zero is zero. That of which [the square] is the square is [its] square root.[20]/nHere Brahmagupta states that 0/0 = 0 and as for the question of a/0 where a \u2260 0 he did not commit himself.[28] His rules for arithmetic on negative numbers and zero are quite close to the modern understanding, except that in modern mathematics division by zero is left undefined./nIn chapter twelve of his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, Brahmagupta provides a formula useful for generating Pythagorean triples:/n12.39. The height of a mountain multiplied by a given multiplier is the distance to a city; it is not erased. When it is divided by the multiplier increased by two it is the leap of one of the two who make the same journey.[29]/nOr, in other words, if  d = mx/x + 2, then a traveller who \"leaps\" vertically upwards a distance d from the top of a mountain of height m, and then travels in a straight line to a city at a horizontal distance mx from the base of the mountain, travels the same distance as one who descends vertically down the mountain and then travels along the horizontal to the city.[29] Stated geometrically, this says that if a right-angled triangle has a base of length  a = mx and altitude of length b = m + d, then the length, c, of its hypotenuse is given by c = m(1 + x) \u2212 d. And, indeed, elementary algebraic manipulation shows that  a2 + b2 = c2 whenever d has the value stated. Also, if m and x are rational, so are d, a, b and c. A Pythagorean triple can therefore be obtained from a, b and c by multiplying each of them by the least common multiple of their denominators./nBrahmagupta went on to give a recurrence relation for generating solutions to certain instances of Diophantine equations of the second degree such as Nx2 + 1 = y2 (called Pell's equation) by using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm was known to him as the \"pulverizer\" since it breaks numbers down into ever smaller pieces.[30]/nThe nature of squares:18.64. [Put down] twice the square-root of a given square by a multiplier and increased or diminished by an arbitrary [number]. The product of the first [pair], multiplied by the multiplier, with the product of the last [pair], is the last computed.18.65. The sum of the thunderbolt products is the first. The additive is equal to the product of the additives. The two square-roots, divided by the additive or the subtractive, are the additive rupas.[20]/nThe key to his solution was the identity,[31]/nwhich is a generalisation of an identity that was discovered by Diophantus,/nUsing his identity and the fact that if (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are solutions to the equations x2 \u2212 Ny2 = k1 and x2 \u2212 Ny2 = k2, respectively, then (x1x2 + Ny1y2, x1y2 + x2y1) is a solution to x2 \u2212 Ny2 = k1k2, he was able to find integral solutions to Pell's equation through a series of equations of the form x2 \u2212 Ny2 = ki. Brahmagupta was not able to apply his solution uniformly for all possible values of N, rather he was only able to show that if x2 \u2212 Ny2 = k has an integer solution for k = \u00b11, \u00b12, or \u00b14, then x2 \u2212 Ny2 = 1 has a solution. The solution of the general Pell's equation would have to wait for Bh\u0101skara II in c.\u20091150 CE.[31]/nBrahmagupta's most famous result in geometry is his formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. Given the lengths of the sides of any cyclic quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave an approximate and an exact formula for the figure's area,/n12.21. The approximate area is the product of the halves of the sums of the sides and opposite sides of a triangle and a quadrilateral. The accurate [area] is the square root from the product of the halves of the sums of the sides diminished by [each] side of the quadrilateral.[25]/nSo given the lengths p, q, r and s of a cyclic quadrilateral, the approximate area is p + r/2 \u00b7 q + s/2 while, letting t = p + q + r + s/2, the exact area is/nAlthough Brahmagupta does not explicitly state that these quadrilaterals are cyclic, it is apparent from his rules that this is the case.[32] Heron's formula is a special case of this formula and it can be derived by setting one of the sides equal to zero./nBrahmagupta dedicated a substantial portion of his work to geometry. One theorem gives the lengths of the two segments a triangle's base is divided into by its altitude:/n12.22. The base decreased and increased by the difference between the squares of the sides divided by the base; when divided by two they are the true segments. The perpendicular [altitude] is the square-root from the square of a side diminished by the square of its segment.[25]/nThus the lengths of the two segments are 1/2(b \u00b1 c2 \u2212 a2/b)./nHe further gives a theorem on rational triangles. A triangle with rational sides a, b, c and rational area is of the form:/nfor some rational numbers u, v, and w.[33]/nBrahmagupta continues,/n12.23. The square-root of the sum of the two products of the sides and opposite sides of a non-unequal quadrilateral is the diagonal. The square of the diagonal is diminished by the square of half the sum of the base and the top; the square-root is the perpendicular [altitudes].[25]/nSo, in a \"non-unequal\" cyclic quadrilateral (that is, an isosceles trapezoid), the length of each diagonal is \u221apr + qs./nHe continues to give formulas for the lengths and areas of geometric figures, such as the circumradius of an isosceles trapezoid and a scalene quadrilateral, and the lengths of diagonals in a scalene cyclic quadrilateral. This leads up to Brahmagupta's famous theorem,/n12.30\u201331. Imaging two triangles within [a cyclic quadrilateral] with unequal sides, the two diagonals are the two bases. Their two segments are separately the upper and lower segments [formed] at the intersection of the diagonals.

He essentially manipulated right triangles to produce isosceles triangles, scalene triangles, rectangles, isosceles trapezoids, isosceles trapezoids with three equal sides, and a scalene cyclic quadrilateral./nAfter giving the value of pi, he deals with the geometry of plane figures and solids, such as finding volumes and surface areas (or empty spaces dug out of solids). He finds the volume of rectangular prisms, pyramids, and the frustum of a square pyramid. He further finds the average depth of a series of pits. For the volume of a frustum of a pyramid, he gives the \"pragmatic\" value as the depth times the square of the mean of the edges of the top and bottom faces, and he gives the \"superficial\" volume as the depth times their mean area.[34]/nIn Chapter 2 of his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, entitled Planetary True Longitudes, Brahmagupta presents a sine table:/n2.2\u20135. The sines: The Progenitors, twins; Ursa Major, twins, the Vedas; the gods, fires, six; flavors, dice, the gods; the moon, five, the sky, the moon; the moon, arrows, suns [...][35]/nHere Brahmagupta uses names of objects to represent the digits of place-value numerals, as was common with numerical data in Sanskrit treatises. Progenitors represents the 14 Progenitors (\"Manu\") in Indian cosmology or 14, \"twins\" means 2, \"Ursa Major\" represents the seven stars of Ursa Major or 7, \"Vedas\" refers to the 4 Vedas or 4, dice represents the number of sides of the traditional die or 6, and so on.

If a thing wants to go deeper down than the earth, let it try. The earth is the only low thing, and seeds always return to it, in whatever direction you may throw them away, and never rise upwards from the earth.[38][39][a]/nBrahmagupta directed a great deal of criticism towards the work of rival astronomers, and his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta displays one of the earliest schisms among Indian mathematicians. The division was primarily about the application of mathematics to the physical world, rather than about the mathematics itself. In Brahmagupta's case, the disagreements stemmed largely from the choice of astronomical parameters and theories.[40] Critiques of rival theories appear throughout the first ten astronomical chapters and the eleventh chapter is entirely devoted to criticism of these theories, although no criticisms appear in the twelfth and eighteenth chapters.[40]/nSome of the important contributions made by Brahmagupta in astronomy are his methods for calculating the position of heavenly bodies over time (ephemerides), their rising and setting, conjunctions, and the calculation of solar and lunar eclipses.[41]/nIn chapter seven of his Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta, entitled Lunar Crescent, Brahmagupta rebuts the idea that the Moon is farther from the Earth than the Sun.[clarification needed] He does this by explaining the illumination of the Moon by the Sun.[42]/n1. If the moon were above the sun, how would the power of waxing and waning, etc., be produced from calculation of the longitude of the moon? The near half would always be bright./n2. In the same way that the half seen by the sun of a pot standing in sunlight is bright, and the unseen half dark, so is [the illumination] of the moon [if it is] beneath the sun./n3. The brightness is increased in the direction of the sun. At the end of a bright [i.e. waxing] half-month, the near half is bright and the far half dark. Hence, the elevation of the horns [of the crescent can be derived] from calculation. [...][43]/nHe explains that since the Moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun, the degree of the illuminated part of the Moon depends on the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon, and this can be computed from the size of the angle between the two bodies.[42]/nFurther work exploring the longitudes of the planets, diurnal rotation, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the moon's crescent and conjunctions of the planets, are discussed in his treatise Khandakhadyaka.", "297208": "Yajnavalkya or Yagyavalkya (Sanskrit: \u092f\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0915\u094d\u092f, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya) is a Hindu Vedic sage featuring in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 700 BCE).[1][2][3][4] Yajnavalkya proposes and debates metaphysical questions about the nature of existence, consciousness and impermanence, and expounds the epistemic doctrine of neti neti (\"not this, not this\") to discover the universal Self and \u0100tman.[5] Texts attributed to him include the Yajnavalkya Smriti, Yoga Yajnavalkya and some texts of the Vedanta school.[6][7] He is also mentioned in various Brahmanas and Aranyakas.[6]/nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is dated at c. 700 BCE.[4][8] Staal notes that though the name Yajnavalkya is derived from yajna, which connotes ritual, Yajnavalkya is referred to as \"a thinker, not a ritualist\".[1]/nY\u0101j\u00f1avalkya was the pupil of Udd\u0101laka \u0100ru\u1e47i, whom he defeated in debate.[9]/nIn the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, a set of dialogues portrays Yajnavalkya as having two wives, one Maitreyi who challenges Yajnavalkya with philosophical questions like a scholarly wife; the other Katyayani who is silent but mentioned as a housewife.[10] While Yajnavalkya and Katyayani lived in contented domesticity, Maitreyi studied metaphysics and engaged in theological dialogues with her husband in addition to \"making self-inquiries of introspection\".[10][11] In contrast to the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the epic Mahabharata states Maitreyi is a young beauty who is an Advaita scholar but never marries.[12]/nThe figure of Yajnavalkya is considered by Scharfstein as one of the earliest philosophers in recorded history.[3] Yajnavalkya is credited by Witzel for coining the term Advaita (non-duality of Atman and Brahman).[13] The ideas attributed to him for renunciation of worldly attachments have been important to Hindu sannyasa traditions.[14]/nYajnavalkya is associated with several major ancient texts in Sanskrit, namely the Shukla Yajurveda, the Shatapatha Brahmana, the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Dharmasastra named Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti, Vriddha Yajnavalkya, and Brihad Yajnavalkya.[6] He is also mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas,[15][16] as well as in ancient Jainism texts such as the Isibhasiyaim.[17]/nAnother important and influential Yoga text in Hinduism is named after him, namely Yoga Yajnavalkya, but its author is unclear. The actual author of Yoga Yajnavalkya text was probably someone who lived many centuries after the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya.[18] Ian Whicher, a professor of Religion at the University of Manitoba, states that the author of Yoga Yajnavalkya may be an ancient Yajnavalkya, but this Yajnavalkya is not to be confused with the Vedic-era Yajnavalkya \"who is revered in Hinduism for Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\".[19]/nAccording to Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik, these references to Yajnavalkya in other texts, in addition to the eponymous Yoga Yajnavalkya, may be to different sages with the same name.[16]/nOne of the early expositions of karma and rebirth theories appear in the discussions of Yajnavalkya.[20]/nNow as a man is like this or like that,\naccording as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;\na man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;\nhe becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;\n\nAnd here they say that a person consists of desires,\nand as is his desire, so is his will;\nand as is his will, so is his deed;\nand whatever deed he does, that he will reap./nMax Muller and Paul Deussen, in their respective translations, describe the Upanishad's view of \"Soul, Self\" and \"free, liberated state of existence\" as, \"[Self] is imperishable, for he cannot perish; he is unattached, for he does not attach himself; unfettered, he does not suffer, he does not fail. He is beyond good and evil, and neither what he has done, nor what he has omitted to do, affects him. (...) He therefore who knows it [reached self-realization], becomes quiet, subdued, satisfied, patient, and collected. He sees self in Self, sees all as Self. Evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil. Evil does not burn him, he burns all evil. Free from evil, free from spots, free from doubt, he became Atman-Br\u00e2hmana; this is the Brahma-world, O King, thus spoke Yajnavalkya.\"[22][23]/nThe section 4.3 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is attributed to Yajnavalkya, and it discusses the premises of moksha (liberation, freedom), and provides some of its most studied hymns. Paul Deussen calls it, \"unique in its richness and warmth of presentation\", with profoundness that retains its full worth in modern times.[24]/nWhen asked by King Janaka,\"What is the light of man?\" he replies, \"The sun, O King; for, having the sun alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\" Then the king asks, \"When the sun sets, what is the light of man?\" He replies, \"The moon indeed is his light; for, having the moon alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\" Then the king asks, \"When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, what is the light of man\u00a0?\" He replies, \"Fire indeed is his light; for, having fire alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\" Then the king asks, \"When the sun has set, O Yajnavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, what is then the light of man?\" He replies, \"Sound indeed is his light; for, having sound alone for his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns. Therefore, O King, when one cannot see even one's own hand, yet when a sound is raised, one goes towards it.\" Then the king asks, \"When the sun has set, O Yajnaavalkya, and the moon has set, and the fire is gone out, and the sound hushed, what is then the light of man?\" He replies, \"The Self indeed is his light; for, having the Self alone as his light, man sits, moves about, does his work, and returns.\"[25]/nHe describes the self by a series of negations and says it is not, not (neti, neti) - not graspable, not destructible, not attached, not disturbed by anything good or bad done by himself. He then says, he who knows this truth remains \"controlled, at peace, patient and full of faith\" and \"everyone comes to be his self\" and \"he becomes the self of everyone\"[26][27]/nYajnavlkya believed that dreams are active projections of the self. To him, this is evidence of that dreaming shares the creative nature of Reality in itself.[28]/nThe Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad states that love is driven by \"love for oneself (\u0101tman),\"[29] and discusses the nature of Atman and Brahman and their unity,[30] which forms the core of later Advaita philosophy.[31] The dialogue has survived in two manuscript recensions from the Madhyamdina and Kanva Vedic schools. Although they have significant literary differences, they share the same philosophical theme.[32]/nThis dialogue appears in several Hindu texts; the earliest is in chapter 2.4 \u2013 and modified in chapter 4.5 \u2013 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the principal and oldest Upanishads.[33][34] Adi Shankara, a scholar of the influential Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, wrote in his Brihadaranyakopanishad bhashya that the purpose of the Maitreyi-Yajnavalkya dialogue in chapter 2.4 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is to highlight the importance of the knowledge of Atman and Brahman, and to understand their oneness.[35][36] According to Shankara, the dialogue suggests renunciation is prescribed in the Sruti (vedic texts of Hinduism), as a means to knowledge of the Brahman and Atman.[37] He adds, that the pursuit of self-knowledge is considered important in the Sruti because the Maitreyi dialogue is repeated in chapter 4.5 as a \"logical finale\" to the discussion of Brahman in the Upanishad.[38]/nConcluding his dialogue on the \"inner self\", or soul, Yajnavalkaya tells Maitreyi:[33]/nOne should indeed see, hear, understand and meditate over the Self, O Maitreyi;\nindeed, he who has seen, heard, reflected and understood the Self \u2013 by him alone the whole world comes to be known.", "71993594": "Roberto Markarian Abrahamian (12 December 1946) is a Uruguayan mathematician of Armenian descent, expert in dynamical systems and chaos theory./nHe started studying at the University of the Republic in the 1960s.

He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as:/npractical analysis, integral and differential equations, mechanics, hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, constructive geometry, probability calculus, statistics and philosophy.[2]/nAlthough best known for his mathematical work, von Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist and empiricist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a \"first phase\" from 1907 through 1914 with  Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath.[citation needed][3] His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology. His brother developed praxeology, an a priori view.[4]/nDuring his time in Istanbul, Mises maintained close contact with Philipp Frank,[5] a logical positivist and Professor of Physics in Prague until 1938. His literary interests included the Austrian novelist Robert Musil and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, on whom he became a recognized expert.[6]/nVon Mises was born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary into a Jewish family, eighteen months after his brother Ludwig von Mises, who became a prominent economist of the Austrian School, a heterodox school of economics. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig had a younger brother, Karl von Mises, who died as an infant from Scarlet Fever.[7] Richard attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in Latin and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, he was appointed as Georg Hamel's assistant in Br\u00fcnn (Brno).

In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Stra\u00dfburg, then part of the German Empire (later Strasbourg, Alsace, France) and received Prussian citizenship.

After reaching the Persian Gulf, he took a Portuguese ship to India. He stayed in Goa for three years and then continued his voyage around the Cape of Good Hope, eventually arriving in Lisbon. He went from there to Paris and visited other European cities before returning to Italy and visiting Venice, Florence and Rome. During this trip he drafted the initial design for his compass.[1]/nBased on the success of his design, Mordente took service in 1571 at the court of Emperor Maximilian II in Vienna. From 1578 he served in Prague at the court of Rudolph II, to whom he dedicated an edition of Anversa in 1584. In Prague, he also met Michiel Coignet and Giordano Bruno, who used the compass to refute Aristotle's hypothesis on the incommensurability of infinitesimals, thus confirming the existence of the \"minimum\" which was the basis of his atomic theory.[2] Bruno published the dialogues Mordentius and De Mordentii circino which praised Mordente, but also presented criticisms that raised protests from the mathematician. Mordente replied in 1586 and Bruno responded with the satires Idiota triumphans and De somnii interpretatione. After Mordente gained support in the dispute from the French Charles, Duke of Guise, Bruno was forced to flee Paris./nAfter this controversy, Mordente took service with the Duke of Guise until his death.

Dign\u0101ga's work laid the groundwork for the development of deductive logic in India and created the first system of Buddhist logic and epistemology (Pramana).[1]/nAccording to Georges B. Dreyfus, his philosophical school brought about an Indian \"epistemological turn\" and became the \"standard formulation of Buddhist logic and epistemology in India and Tibet.\"[2] Dign\u0101ga's thought influenced later Buddhist philosophers like Dharmakirti and also Hindu thinkers of the Nyaya school. Dign\u0101ga's epistemology accepted only \"perception\" (pratyaksa) and \"inference\" (anum\u0101\u1e47a) as valid instruments of knowledge and introduced the widely influential theory of \"exclusion\" (apoha) to explain linguistic meaning.[3] His work on language, inferential reasoning and perception were also widely influential among later Indian philosophers.[4] According to Richard P. Hayes \"some familiarity with Dinnaga's arguments and conclusions is indispensable for anyone who wishes to understand the historical development of Indian thought.\"[5]/nDign\u0101ga was born in Simhavakta near Kanchipuram and very little is known of his early years, except that he took Nagadatta of the Pudgalavada school as his spiritual preceptor, before being expelled and becoming a student of Vasubandhu.[6]/nDign\u0101ga mature philosophy is expounded in his magnum opus, the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya. In chapter one, Dign\u0101ga explains his epistemology which holds that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (pram\u0101\u1e47a); \"perception\" or \"sensation\" (pratyak\u1e63a) and \"inference\" or \"reasoning\" (anum\u0101\u1e47a). In chapter one, Dign\u0101ga writes:/nSensation and reasoning are the only two means of acquiring knowledge, because two attributes are knowable; there is no knowable object other than the peculiar and the general attribute. I shall show that sensation has the peculiar attribute as its subject matter, while reasoning has the general attribute as its subject matter.[7]/nPerception is a non-conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.[8] This conservative epistemic theory was in contrast to the Nyaya school who accepted other means of knowledge such as upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison and analogy)./nPratyak\u1e63a is a kind of awareness that acquires information about particulars, and is immediately present to one of the senses. This is the topic of the first chapter of the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya.[9] For Dign\u0101ga, perception is pre-verbal, pre-conceptual and unstructured sense data. In chapter two of the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya he writes:/nSensation is devoid of structure. That cognition in which there is no structure is sensation. What kind of thing is this so-called structure? Attaching a name, a universal and so forth.[10]/nAccording to Dign\u0101ga our mind always takes raw sense data or particulars and interprets them or groups them together in more complex ways, compares them to past experiences, gives them names to classify them based on general attributes (samanyalaksana) and so forth. This process he terms kalpana (arranging, structuring).[11] This cognitive process is already different from sensation, which is a simple cognition based only on the immediately present. Thus pratyak\u1e63a is only awareness of particular sense data such as a patch of green color and the sensation of hardness, never awareness of a macroscopic object such an apple which is always a higher level synthesis.[12] For Dign\u0101ga, sensation is also inerrant, it cannot \"stray\" because it is the most basic and simple phenomenon of experience or as he puts it:/n\"it is impossible too for the object of awareness itself to be errant, for errancy is only the content of misinterpretation by the mind.\"[13]/nAlso, for Dignaga, pratyak\u1e63a is mostly phenomenalist and is not dependent on the existence of an external world. It is also inexpressible and private.[14]/nAnum\u0101\u1e47a (inference or reasoning) for Dign\u0101ga is a type of cognition which is only aware of general attributes, and is constructed out of simpler sensations. Inference can also be communicated through linguistic conventions.[15]/nA central issue which concerned Dign\u0101ga was the interpretation of signs (linga) or the evidence (hetu) which led one to an inference about states of affairs; such as how smoke can lead one to infer that there is a fire.[16] This topic of sv\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na (reasoning, literally \"inference for oneself\") is the subject of chapter two of the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya while the topic of the third chapter is about demonstration (par\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na, literally \"inference for others\"), that is, how one communicates one's inferences through proper argument.[17]/nAccording to Richard Hayes, in Dign\u0101ga's system, to obtain knowledge that a property (the \"inferable property\", sadhya) is inherent in a \"subject of inference\" (paksa) it must be derived through an inferential sign (linga). For this to occur, the following must be true:[18]/nRichard Hayes interprets these criteria as overly strict and this is because he sees Dign\u0101ga's system as one of rational skepticism. Dign\u0101ga's epistemology, argues Hayes, is a way to express and practice the traditional Buddhist injunction to not become attached to views and opinions.[19] According to Hayes, for Dign\u0101ga, the role of logic is:/nto counter dogmatism and prejudice. As a weapon in the battle against prejudice that rages in every mind that seeks wisdom--in minds of the vast majority of people who do not seek wisdom, prejudice simply takes full control without a contest-there is nothing as powerful as the kind of reason that lies at the heart of Dignaga's system of logic. For it should be clear that very few of our judgments in ordinary life pass the standards set by the three characteristics of legitimate' evidence. Taken in its strictest interpretation, none of the judgments of any but a  fully omniscient being passes. And, since there is no evidence that there exist any fully omniscient beings, the best available working hypothesis is that no one's thinking is immune from errors that require revision in the face of newly discovered realities.[20]/nDign\u0101ga considered the interpretation of conventional and symbolic signs such as the words and sentences of human language to be no more than special or conventional instances of the general principles of inference or anumana.[21] He takes up several issues relating to language and its relationship to inference in the fifth chapter of his Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya.[22]/nDuring Dign\u0101ga's time, the orthodox Indian Nyaya school and also Hindu Sanskrit grammarians (such as Bhart\u1e5bhari) had discussed issues of epistemology and language respectively, but their theories generally accepted the concept of universals which was rejected by most Buddhist philosophers. Influenced by the work of these thinkers as well as by Buddhist philosophers of the Sautrantika school who rejected Hindu theories of universals in favor of nominalism (praj\u00f1apti), Dign\u0101ga developed his own Buddhist theory of language and meaning based on the concept of \"apoha\" (exclusion).[23] Hattori Masaaki explains the doctrine thus:/na word indicates an object merely through the exclusion of other objects (anyapoha, -vyavrtti). For example, the word \"cow\" simply means that the object is not a non-cow. As such, a word cannot denote anything real, whether it be an individual (vyakti), a universal (jati), or any other thing. The apprehension of an object by means of the exclusion of other objects is nothing but an inference.[24]/nAs noted by Hayes, the difficulty in studying the highly terse works of Dign\u0101ga is considerable, because none of them have survived in the original Sanskrit and the Tibetan and Chinese translations which do survive show signs of having been done by translators who were not completely certain of the meaning of the work.[25] This difficulty has also led scholars to read Dignaga through the lens of later authors such as Dharmakirti and their Indian and Tibetan interpreters as well as their Hindu Nyaya opponents. Because of this tendency in scholarship, ideas which are actually innovations of Dharmakirti and later authors have often been associated with Dignaga by scholars such as Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and S. Mookerjee, even though these thinkers often differ.[26]/nDign\u0101ga's magnum opus, the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya (Compendium of Valid Cognition), examined perception, language and inferential reasoning. It presents perception as a bare cognition, devoid of conceptualization and sees language as useful fictions created through a process of exclusion (Apoha).[27]/nOther works include:/nDign\u0101ga founded a tradition of Buddhist epistemology and reasoning, and this school is sometimes called the \"School of Dign\u0101ga\" or \"The school of Dinn\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti\" (due to the strong influence of Dharmak\u012brti as well).[28] In Tibetan it is often called \"those who follow reasoning\" (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da', often translated as \"the Epistemological School.\"[29] Many of the figures in these were commentators on the works of Dinn\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti, but some of them also wrote original works and developed the tradition in new directions.[28][30][31]/nThe work of this tradition also went on to influence the Buddhist Madhyamaka school, through the work of figures like Bh\u0101vaviveka (c.\u2009500\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009578), J\u00f1anagarbha (700-760), and \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (725\u2013788). These thinkers attempted to adopt the logical and epistemological insights of Dinn\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti to defend the tenets of the Madhyamaka school./nDign\u0101ga's tradition of logic and epistemology continued in Tibet, where it was expanded by thinkers such as Cha-ba (1182\u20131251) and Sakya Pandita (1182\u20131251)./nDign\u0101ga also influenced non-Buddhist Sanskrit thinkers. According to Lawrence J. McCrea, and Parimal G. Patil, Dign\u0101ga set in motion an \"epistemic turn\" in Indian philosophy. After Dign\u0101ga, most Indian philosophers were now expected to defend their views by using a fully developed epistemological theory (which they also had to defend).[32]", "19958051": "Herbert Blaine Lawson, Jr. is a mathematician best known for his work in minimal surfaces, calibrated geometry, and algebraic cycles.

He was Professor at the Paris 13 University (University of Paris-Nord) and president of the World Organization of Systems and Cybernetics (WOSC).[1][2]/nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Vall\u00e9e wrote his first publications on what he named \"op\u00e9rateur d'observation\" (which means in English \"operator of observation\"). The latter, in the simplest case, allows a cybernetic system to observe the state of its environment and itself. Thereafter, on the basis of these results, a decisional operator will be able to indicate the action to be taken. The two stages of perception and decision are distinguished by \"intellectual convenience\",[3] but it is interesting to gather them in a unique operator, known as \"pragmatic\". A decision is influenced by the observation of events, but also by past perceptions. That means that, in the observation made at a given moment, traces of past observations are also present. Eventually, these processes follow one another in a loop. Vall\u00e9e defined the study of this situation with the term \"epistemo-praxeology\", underlining the existing link between knowledge (episteme), resulting from observation, and action (praxis). Regarding the observation problem, Vall\u00e9e was also interested in information theory./nVall\u00e9e also nourished private interests in sociological problems as well as in history.

The results obtained in this area became the body of his thesis and he was awarded his Ph.D. (\"candidate degree\") in 1976./nShokurov works on the birational geometry of algebraic varieties. After obtaining his Ph.D., he worked at the Yaroslavl State Pedagogical University together with Zalman Skopec. It was Skopec and another colleague, Vasily Iskovskikh, who influenced considerably the development of Shokurov's mathematical interests at that time. Iskovskikh, who was working on the classification of three-dimensional smooth Fano varieties of principal series, posed two classical problems to Shokurov: the existence of a line on smooth Fano varieties and the smoothness of a general element in the anticanonical linear system of any such variety. Shokurov solved both of these problems for three-dimensional Fano varieties and the methods which he introduced for this purpose were later developed in the works of other mathematicians, who generalized Shokurov's ideas to the case of higher-dimensional Fano varieties, and even to the Fano varieties with (admissible) singularities./nIn 1983, Shokurov's paper Prym varieties: theory and applications was published. In it Shokurov brought to a completion the work on solving the Schottky-type problem for Prym varieties which originated in papers of Arnaud Beauville and Andrey Tyurin. Shokurov proved a criterion which allows to decide whether the principally polarized Prym variety of a Beauville's pair, subject\nto some stability conditions, is the Jacobian of some smooth curve. As the main application this criterion provided the Iskovskikh's criterion for rationality of a standard conic bundle\nwhose base is a smooth minimal rational surface./nSince the late 80's Shokurov began to contribute to the development of the Minimal model program (MMP). In 1984 he published a paper titled On the closed cone of curves of algebraic 3-folds\nwhere he proved that the negative part of the closed cone of effective curves on an algebraic 3-fold (with admissible singularities) is locally polyhedral. A bit later, in 1985, Shokurov published a paper titled The nonvanishing theorem, which became a cornerstone for the whole MMP as it was used in the proofs of such fundamental theorems as the Cone theorem and the Semi-ampleness theorem. Also in this paper, Shokurov proved the termination of three-dimensional flips. And even though\nhe proved this only for three-dimensional varieties, most of his techniques were later generalized by Yujiro Kawamata to obtain similar results for varieties of any dimension./nOne of Shokurov's ideas formed a basis for a paper titled 3-fold log flips\nwhere the existence of three-dimensional flips (first proved by Shigefumi Mori) was established in a more general log setting. The inductive method and the singularity theory of log pairs developed in the framework of that paper allowed most of the paper's results to be later generalized to arbitrary-dimensional varieties. Later on, in 2001, Shokurov announced the proof of the existence of 4-dimensional log flips, whose complete version appeared in two books: Flips for 3-folds and 4-folds and Birational geometry: linear systems and finitely-generated algebras. An application of Shokurov's ideas concerning the existence of log flips has led to the paper Existence of minimal models for varieties of log general type by Caucher Birkar, Paolo Cascini, Christopher Hacon and James McKernan./nShokurov is presently a full professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and a non-tenured faculty member of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Moscow.[1][2] He is involved both in research and in teaching and he has supervised 9 Ph.D. students in different problems of birational geometry, including Fields medallist Caucher Birkar, Florin Ambro, Ivan Cheltsov, Jihun Park, Sung Rak Choi, Yifei Chen, Joseph Cutrone, and Nicholas Marshburn.", "30837114": "Subbaramiah Minakshisundaram (12 October 1913 - 13 August 1968), also known as Minakshi or SMS, was an Indian mathematician who worked on partial differential equations and heat kernels.

After earning his high-school diploma in 1921, he enrolled in the Department of engineering to swap to mathematics in November 1923. Immediately after earning his laurea in 1925, he became the assistant of Mauro Picone, who in that year was called to the University of Naples, where he remained until 1932. Picone immediately discovered Caccioppoli's brilliance and pointed him towards research in mathematical analysis. During the following five years, Caccioppoli published about 30 works on topics developed in the complete autonomy provided by a ministerial award for mathematics in 1931, a competition he won at the age of 27 and the chair of algebraic analysis at the University of Padova. In 1934 he returned to Naples to accept the chair in group theory; later he took the chair of superior analysis, and from 1943 onwards, the chair in mathematical analysis./nIn 1931 he became a correspondent member of the Academy of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Naples, becoming an ordinary member in 1938. In 1944 he became an ordinary member of the Accademia Pontaniana, and in 1947 a correspondent member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, and a national member in 1958. He was also a correspondent member of the Paduan Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts. In the years from 1947 to 1957, he directed, together with Carlo Miranda, the journal Giornale di Matematiche, founded by Giuseppe Battaglini. In 1948 he became a member of the editing committee of Annali di Matematica, and starting in 1952 he was also a member of the editing committee of Ricerche di Matematica. In 1953 the Academia dei Lincei bestowed on him the national prize of physical, mathematical, and natural sciences./nHe was an excellent pianist, noted as well for his nonconformist temperament. He tried out the vagrant life, and was arrested for begging. In May 1938 he gave a speech against Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, when the latter was visiting Naples. Together with his companion Sara Mancuso, he had the French national anthem played by an orchestra, after which he began to speak against fascism and Nazism in the presence of OVRA agents. He was again arrested, but his aunt, Maria Bakunin, who at the time was a professor of chemistry at the University of Naples, succeeded in having him released by convincing the authorities that her nephew was non compos mentis. Thus Caccioppoli was interned, but he continued his studies in mathematics, and playing the piano./nIn his last years, the disappointments of politics and his wife's desertion, together perhaps with the weakening of his mathematical vein, pushed him into alcoholism. His growing instability had sharpened his \"strangenesses\", to the point that the news of his suicide on May 8, 1959, by a headshot did not surprise those who knew him. He died at his home in Palazzo Cellamare./nHis most important works, out of a total of around eighty publications, relate to functional analysis and the calculus of variations. Beginning in 1930 he dedicated himself to the study of differential equations, the first to use a topological-functional approach. Proceeding in this way, in 1931 he extended the Brouwer fixed point theorem, applying the results obtained both from ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations./nIn 1932 he introduced the general concept of inversion of functional correspondence, showing that a transformation between two Banach spaces is invertible only if it is locally invertible and if the only convergent sequences are the compact ones./nBetween 1933 and 1938 he applied his results to elliptic equations, establishing the majorizing limits for their solutions, generalizing the two-dimensional case of Felix Bernstein. At the same time he studied analytic functions of several complex variables, that is, analytic functions whose domain belongs to the vector space Cn, proving in 1933 the fundamental theorem on normal families of such functions: if a family is normal with respect to every complex variable, it is also normal with respect to the set of the variables. He also proved a logarithmic residue formula for functions of two complex variables in 1949./nIn 1935 Caccioppoli proved the analyticity of class C2 solutions of elliptic equations with analytic coefficients./nThe year 1952 saw the publication of his masterwork on the area of a surface and measure theory, the article Measure and integration of dimensionally oriented sets (Misura e integrazione degli insiemi dimensionalmente orientati, Rendiconti dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, s. VIII, v.12). The article is mainly concerned with the theory of dimensionally oriented sets; that is, an interpretation of surfaces as oriented boundaries of sets in space.

One of her two sisters, Florence Stoney, was a radiologist and received an OBE. Her cousin was the Dublin-based physicist George Francis FitzGerald FRS (1851\u20131901), and her uncle Bindon Blood Stoney FRS was Engineer of Dublin Port, renowned for building a number of the main Dublin bridges, and developing the Quayside./nEdith Stoney demonstrated considerable mathematical talent and gained a scholarship at Newnham College, Cambridge, where she achieved a First in the Part I Tripos examination in 1893. However, she was not awarded a University of Cambridge degree as women were excluded from graduation until 1948. During her time at Newnham, she was in charge of the College telescope.[4] She was later awarded a BA and an MA from Trinity College, Dublin, after they accepted women in 1904./nAfter briefly working on gas turbine calculations and searchlight design for Sir Charles Algernon Parsons, she took a mathematics teaching post at the Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College./nFollowing the 1876 Medical Act, it was illegal for academic institutions to prevent access to medical education based on gender. The first medical school for women in Britain was established in 1874 by Dr Sophia Jex-Blake in anticipation of this law. The London School of Medicine for Women quickly became part of the University of London, with clinical teaching at the Royal Free Hospital. Edith's sister Florence was a student at the school, she graduated in medicine with honours in 1895 (MB BS) and obtained her MD in 1898.[5] Meanwhile,  Edith gained an appointment as a physics lecturer at the school in 1899.[6] Her first tasks were to set up a physics laboratory and design the physics course. The laboratory was planned for 20 students, and the course content was pure physics, as required by university regulations; it included mechanics, magnetism, electricity, optics, sound, heat and energy. In her Lancet Obituary, an ex-student  of hers noted:  \u201cHer lectures on physics mostly developed into informal talks, during which Miss Stoney, usually in a blue pinafore, scratched on a blackboard with coloured chalks, turning anxiously at intervals to ask \u2018Have you taken my point?\u2019. She was perhaps too good a mathematician \u2026 to understand the difficulties of the average medical student, but experience had taught her how distressing these could be\u201d.[7]/nIn 1901, the Royal Free Hospital appointed Florence into a new part-time position of medical electrician.[5] The following April, the two sisters opened a new x-ray service in the electrical department[8]\nDuring their time at the Royal Free Hospital, the two sisters actively supported the women's suffrage movement, though opposed the direct violent action with which it was later associated.[2][5] \nDuring her time at the school, she also played a central role in the British Federation of University Women (BFUW). She was elected treasurer, in her absence, at the first executive meeting on 9 October 1909, a position that she held until the end of May 1915.[9] She became increasingly engaged with the political lobbying of the Federation.  At the executive meeting on 19 October 1912, she proposed the names of two members for a subcommittee to secure the passing into law of a bill to enable women to become barristers, solicitors or parliamentary agents. The legislation  was eventually enacted  after the war within the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919.\nEdith Stoney resigned her post at the school in March 1915 and it was recorded that \u2018with due regret and most unwillingly a change is desirable in the physics lectureship\u2019. Edith Stoney was offered \u00a3300 on tendering her resignation.[10]/nBoth Florence and Edith offered their services to the British Red Cross at the War Office in London, to provide a radiological service to support the troops in Europe, on the day Britain declared war. Their offer was refused, because they were women. Florence set up her own unit with the Women's Imperial Service League and spent the next 6 months in Europe. Edith organised supplies from London where she also served on the League's committee.[11]\nFlorence returned to London at the time Edith resigned from the London School of Medicine for Women. Edith contacted the Scottish Women's Hospitals (SWH), an organisation formed in 1914 to give medical support in the field of battle and financed by the women's suffrage movement. The organisation had gained agreement to set up a new 250-bed tented hospital at Domaine de Chanteloup, Sainte-Savine, near Troyes (France), funded by the Cambridge women's colleges of Girton and Newnham and it became Edith's role to plan and operate the x-ray facilities.[12] She established stereoscopy to localise bullets and shrapnel and introduced the use of x-rays in the diagnosis of gas gangrene, interstitial gas being a mandate for immediate amputation to give any chance of survival./nThe hospital was near the front line and, in her own words, by September 1915, \u2018the town had been evacuated, the station had been mined, and we heard the heavy guns ever going at night time\u2019. The unit was entirely female, except for two part-time male drivers, and her technical assistant, Mr Mallett.[12]/nThey were assigned to the Corps Exp\u00e9ditionnaire d\u2019Orient and order to move to Serbia. After boarding the steamship Mossoul in Marseille, they reached Salonika (known as Thessaloniki in modern Greece) on 3 November, where they took the night train north to Ghevgheli (now Gevgelija in modern North Macedonia), on the Serbian side of the Greek border. They set up a hospital in an unused silk factory where they treated 100 patients with injuries ranging from frostbite to severe lung and head wounds.\nFollowing defeats at the hands of Bulgarian forces, Edith and her staff retreated to Salonika by 6 December 1916.\nEleven days later, they had re-established the hospital on a drained low swamp by the sea, and by New Year's Day 1917 Edith had the lights on and the x-rays working. Despite the lack of equipment and resources, she established an electrotherapy department and various equipments for the muscular rehabilitation of the soldiers in their care.[13] She also assisted with problems on two British hospital ships, on which the x-ray systems had been damaged during a storm, and gave support to the SWH unit in Ostrovo (now Arnissa on Lake Vegoritida formerly lake Ostrovo in Northern Greece ), which arrived during September 1916. She had a break for sick leave in December 1917 and returned until the following summer. She applied for an appointment as an army camp radiologist in Salonika, but her demand was blocked by the War Office. \nIn October 1917, she returned to France to lead the x-ray departments at the SWH hospitals of Royaumont and Villers-Cotter\u00eats. In March 1918, she had to supervise a camp closure and retreat for the third time, when Villers-Cotter\u00eats was overrun by the German troops. During the final months of the war the fighting intensified and there was a steep increase in workload; in the month of June alone the x-ray workload peaked at over 1,300, partly because of  an increased use of fluoroscopy.[14]/nHer war service was recognised by several countries, and she was awarded the \u201cM\u00e9daille des \u00e9pid\u00e9mies du minist\u00e8re de la Guerre\u201d and the Croix de Guerre from France, the Order of St Sava from Serbia, and the Victory and British War Medals from Britain./nOn returning to England, Edith Stoney took a post as lecturer in physics in the Household and Social Science department at King's College for Women which she held until  retirement in 1925. After leaving King's she moved to Bournemouth, where she lived with her sister Florence, who was suffering from spinal cancer (and died in 1932). During her retirement, she resumed her work with the BFUW for which she had acted as the first treasurer before the war. She became one of the earliest (and oldest) members of the Women's Engineering Society and played an active part in the organisation until shortly before her death.[15] She travelled widely and, in 1934, she spoke to the Australian Federation of University Women on the\nsubject of women in engineering, highlighting the contribution made by women workers during the war.[2][16]\nIn 1936, she established the Johnstone and Florence Stoney Studentship in the BFUW, for \u2018research in biological, geological, meteorological or radiological science undertaken preferably in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa\u2019.[17] The studentship is now administered by Newnham College, Cambridge, and supports clinical medical students going abroad for their elective period. The declaration of Trust was dated 11 February 1942 and the Johnstone And Florence Stoney Studentship Fund Charity (no. 273043) was registered on 25 Mar 1976.[18]\nEdith Stoney died on 25 June 1938,at age 69, and obituaries were printed in both the scientific and medical press - Nature,[4] The Lancet[7] The Woman Engineer[15] and national newspapers in England, The Times[19] and Australia.[20]/nStoney was remembered for her considerable bravery and resourcefulness in the face of extreme danger, and her imagination in contributing to clinical care under the most difficult conditions of war.

In particular, he showed that for any real number a there exists a rotationally symmetric solution on some ball which takes the value a at the center and diverges to infinity near the boundary. The maximum principle shows, by the monotonicity of f, that a hypothetical global solution u would satisfy u(x) < a for any x and any a, which is impossible./nThe same problem was independently considered by Joseph Keller,[12] who was drawn to it for applications in electrohydrodynamics.

Blaine Lawson, Osserman studied the minimal surface problem in the case that the codimension is larger than one. They considered the case of a graphical minimal submanifold of euclidean space. Their conclusion was that most of the analytical properties which hold in the codimension-one case fail to extend. Solutions to the boundary value problem may exist and fail to be unique, or in other situations may simply fail to exist. Such submanifolds (given as graphs) might not even solve the Plateau problem, as they automatically must in the case of graphical hypersurfaces of Euclidean space./nTheir results pointed to the deep analytical difficulty of general elliptic systems and of the minimal submanifold problem in particular.

He then moved to St John's College, Cambridge, obtaining his PhD under the supervision of John Taylor in 1963.[4] He has 2 daughters and a granddaughter./nAfter a short postdoctoral appointment at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Olive returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Churchill College, becoming a Lecturer in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) in 1965. Here he made key contributions to the approach to particle physics known as S-matrix theory. His 1966 book The Analytic S-matrix co-authored with Richard Eden, Peter Landshoff and John Polkinghorne, remains a definitive text on the subject and is known as ELOP.[4]/nIn 1971, Olive made what he has described as a \"momentous personal decision\" to sacrifice his tenured position in Cambridge and move to the Theory Division, CERN as a fixed-term staff member. He was part of a team assembled by Daniele Amati to work on the theory originally known as the dual resonance model but shortly to be recognised as string theory. In CERN, Olive began the collaborations with the circle of string theorists many of whom feature in his memoir From Dual Fermion to Superstring.  His work at CERN, in part in collaboration with Lars Brink and Ed Corrigan, initially focused on the consistent formulation of dual fermion amplitudes, generalising the existing bosonic models. This period saw several of Olive's major contributions to string theory, including the Gliozzi-Scherk-Olive (GSO) projection which elucidated the role of spacetime supersymmetry in ensuring consistency of the dual fermion model and was to prove an essential step in establishing 10-dimensional superstring theory. He was one of the first to become convinced of the conceptual revolution whereby string theory is viewed as a unified theory of all particle interactions, including gravity, rather than simply as a model of hadrons. This was the subject of his plenary talk at the 1974 Rochester conference in London.[4]/nIn 1977, Olive returned to the UK to take up a lectureship at Imperial College, becoming Professor in 1984 and Head of the Theoretical Physics Group in 1988. He had by now begun collaboration with Peter Goddard and together they produced a series of papers on the mathematical foundations of string theory, notably on Virasoro and Kac-Moody algebras and their representations and relation to vertex operators. One outcome of their work on algebras and lattices was the identification of the special role played by the two Lie groups SO(32) and E8 x E8, which would shortly be shown by Michael Green and John Schwarz to exhibit anomaly cancellation that led to the renaissance of string theory in 1984.[4]/nThis body of work from 1973 to 1983 was recognised with the award of the prestigious Dirac Medal in 1997 to Goddard and Olive \"in recognition of their far-sighted and highly influential contributions to theoretical physics. They have contributed many crucial insights that shaped our emerging understanding of string theory and have also had a far-reaching impact on our understanding of 4-dimensional field theory.\u201d\nThe Dirac Medal also recognised a second major line of research pioneered by Olive, on duality symmetries in gauge field theories, this work was to play a key role in later developments of M-theory. While still at CERN, Olive had begun to study the magnetic monopoles which 't Hooft and Polyakov had shown existed in non-abelian gauge theories, publishing a paper with Peter Goddard and Jean Nuyts.[7] In 1977, together with Claus Montonen, he made the remarkable conjecture that there should exist an electromagnetic dual theory in which the roles of monopoles and gauge bosons are interchanged. In subsequent work with Ed Witten, Olive showed that this duality is realised in a certain class of supersymmetric theories.[8] This Montonen-Olive duality was later found to emerge from a deeper web of dualities underlying M-theory, ushering in the second superstring revolution of the mid 1990s.[4]/nIn 1992, Olive left Imperial to take up a research professorship in mathematics and physics at Swansea University, where together with Ian Halliday he built the theoretical particle physics group. He continued to work on mathematical physics, exploring the deep symmetries underlying quantum field theories, especially affine Toda theory.

The character is portrayed by Amy Acker./nFred was born in San Antonio, Texas to Roger and Patricia \"Trish\" Burkle.  When she finished college, she moved to Los Angeles for graduate school at UCLA.  Originally majoring in history, Fred took a physics class with Professor Seidel, which inspired her to take another path.  Around this time, she began working at Stewart Brunell Public Library.  In 1996, while shelving a demon language book, a curious Fred recited the cryptic text out loud and was accidentally sucked into a dimensional portal to Pylea (her future friend Lorne was sucked into the same portal on his side and ended up in Los Angeles).  It was later discovered that the portal was actually opened by Fred's jealous college professor, Professor Seidel, who had sent every promising student to it, essentially sending them to their death.  Fred was the only one of at least six to return (cf. \"Supersymmetry\").  In high school or college, Fred was a marijuana user as shown in the episode \"Spin the Bottle\".  In that episode, she asks Wesley and \"Liam\" for weed and was also revealed to have had to take a personality disorder test and to be something of a conspiracy theorist./nFor five years, Fred spent an arduous life as a \"cow\", the Pylean word for humans who are kept as slaves, and then as a fugitive.  The harsh life of solitude and serfdom took a serious toll on her social skills, as well as her mental health; when Angel meets Fred, she is curled up in a cave, scribbling on the already-covered walls, having seemingly convinced herself that her previous life in L.A. had not been real./nIt was revealed that Fred had once been forced to wear an explosive shock collar. Fred's salvation comes when Angel and his crew arrive in Pylea to find Cordelia Chase, who had become trapped there.  It is notable that when Angel's demon came fully to the fore, it attacked just about everyone but Fred \u2013 including Gunn and Wesley.  Despite this shocking display of violence, Angel never seemed to scare Fred, and even at his most demonic, he never attacked her.  In fact, her presence seemed to have a calming effect on him./nWhen Pylea is liberated, Fred accompanies Angel and the rest of the gang back to Los Angeles and stays in the Hyperion Hotel to re-adjust to life on Earth and regain her mental stability.  Despite several traumatic instances, such as being held hostage by Gunn's old vampire-hunting crew, she adjusts quite well to \"normal\" life./nHer knowledge of physics and mathematics make her an excellent asset when researching and developing strategies.  Fred quickly develops a romantic relationship with Gunn, which lasts roughly one year.  She is also the object of affection of Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who attempts to step aside after Gunn and Fred started dating, but is still drawn to her.  Near the end of her relationship with Gunn, Fred and Wesley share a kiss, but after discovering that Wesley had been in a relationship \u2013 albeit a rather complex one \u2013 with Lilah Morgan, her feelings for Wesley cool considerably./nEventually, Fred discovers that it was actually her former professor's fault that she had been trapped in Pylea, and indeed, Professor Seidel had attempted to trap her in another world yet again.  Furious, she plots to kill him with Wesley's help.  Gunn feels that such a brutal act, even against Seidel, will ultimately destroy her.  As a result, in a battle where she is trying to trap him in a hell dimension, Gunn snaps Seidel's neck himself and drops the body into the portal.  Unfortunately, this causes a rift between Fred and Gunn, and ultimately ends their relationship./nHowever, everything changes for Fred when she and the rest of Angel's crew join Wolfram & Hart. (While Angel accepts a suite of rooms at Wolfram & Hart as his new home, Fred, and maybe others of the inner circle, find a home in the Los Angeles area: hers is at 511 Windward Circle.[1] This seems to be forgotten with the advent of Illyria.)  Her memory is altered by a spell cast in Season Four's last episode, \"Home\", and it is unclear how much of the events of Seasons Three and Four she remembers differently or at all (everything specific to Angel's son Connor is definitely lost).  Fred receives her own laboratory and becomes the head of Wolfram & Hart's Science Division.  She is a major asset to the team; Angel consistently relies on her department to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  After going on a few dates with co-worker Knox, Fred begins to have feelings for Wesley again.  The pair are together for about a week, but the couple's happiness is not to last./nA mysterious sarcophagus, allowed through customs by a signature from Gunn, appears in the lab.  As Fred examines it, a hole opens in the cover and a breath of wind blows into her face.  It turns out that the sarcophagus is a holding cell for one of the original, pure-breed demons known as the Old Ones, which is predestined to rise again.  The air Fred inhales is actually Illyria's essence, which immediately begins a parasitic existence in her body, eating away at it and making her a shell.  Worse still, Knox had worshipped Illyria for years and worked at Wolfram & Hart for the sole purpose of bringing the demon back.  Because of his affections for Fred, he chose her as the only one \"worthy\" to house his god./nAs Angel and Spike travel to England to find a cure, Wesley remains in Fred's bedroom with her, comforting her as she fights bravely, but slowly begins to die.  Angel learns that the only way to save Fred would be to draw Illyria back to the Deeper Well in England by using her sarcophagus as a beacon.  However, thousands of others would die as Illyria's essence cut across the world back to the Well.  Thus, Angel and Spike are forced to do nothing, deciding that Fred would not want this./nAs she lies dying, Fred's mind begins to give way.  Nearing the end, she panics, stating that Feigenbaum, a stuffed rabbit named for mathematical physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum who studied chaos theory, should be there.  When Wesley asks her who Feigenbaum is, Fred replies that she doesn't know.  Cradling her in his arms, Wesley stays with Fred until the moment she dies, after which her body is taken over by Illyria.  \"Wesley, why can't I stay?\" are Fred's last words./nAccording to Dr. Sparrow, Fred's soul is consumed by the fires of resurrection, which Wesley interprets upon overhearing as soul destruction, seemingly making it impossible for her to return from the dead or enjoy an afterlife, although the specifics of this process are not elaborated.  Later, though, Illyria states that there are remnants of Fred in the form of her memories, which are a source of confusion for Illyria.  On occasion, Illyria takes on the appearance of Fred in order to go about unnoticed and to deal with Fred's parents.  When Wesley dies, Illyria takes on Fred's form to comfort him and because she has Fred's form, the evil warlock Cyvus Vail underestimates her and she easily kills him./nHad Angel gotten a sixth season, Joss Whedon originally intended for Fred and Illyria to either be split in two as revealed by Amy Acker in an interview: \"As I\u2019m playing this new character now, it was just some stuff that he was going to do with her and bringing Fred back and getting to work with both characters\",[2] or for Illyria to take on more and more of Fred's memories.[3]/n(This section does not describe the character in the television series, but rather a character from a series of books published after the series ended.)/nFred seemingly reappears in the fifth, sixth and ninth issues of Angel: After The Fall, manifesting as a transformation of Illyria into not just the physical appearance of Fred, but also her personality.  This happens a first time upon the initial fusion of Hell and L.A. and then a second time upon a reunion of Illyria and Wesley.  Issue #9 reveals that the Illyria and Fred essences have been struggling for dominance over their shared body, and that Spike has been trying to suppress Fred's manifestations (even going so far as to ask Angel for help), and admits that he would have kept Illyria away from the battle had he known Wesley was going to be present.  It is later revealed in Spike: After the Fall that seeing someone Fred cared for triggers the change, while dangerous situations transform her back into Illyria.  However, issue #14 explains that the Fred manifestations were just Illyria's interpretation of Fred; with these remnants lost, Illyria reverts to her true form.  Later the telepath Betta George puts Wesley and Spike's memories (of Fred) into Illyria's brain to make her question her own actions.  Illyria later tries to behave in such a way as Fred would have wanted, and has taken on more of her characteristics (for example, in the After the Fall Epilogue she has scrawled on the walls of her rooms as Fred did, albeit listing methods of killing)./nAfter the Senior Partners rewind time after Angel is killed by Gunn, Angel renames a wing of the L.A. public library the \"Burkle Wyndam-Pryce Wing\" in honor of Fred and Wesley./nIn Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine, Illyria is drained of her mystical energy and powers and is stuck in the physical appearance of Fred.  Illyria believes she should be dead and something inside her must be keeping her alive, and is able to scientifically read graphs to determine why Dawn Summers is dying. Illyria expresses human compassion for Severin, the person who drained her and who is now about to explode with power.  Illyria stays with Severin as he uses his powers to restore magic to the world which also vaporizes himself and Illyria.  Scott Allie later stated it was intentionally left open to interpretation as to whether Fred was influencing Illyria./nBuffy later expresses regret to her noble companion Eldre Koh on the need to destroy Illyria. Koh casts doubt on Buffy's knowledge of the elder ones.[4]/nFred is later discovered alive on the streets of London by Angel.[5] It transpires that, when magic was restored, many aspects of the supernatural were \"reset\", resulting in the resurrection of both Fred and Illyria, sharing the same body.[6] Fred and Illyria thereafter remain with Angel for the remainder  of Season 10 and throughout Angel Season 11./nFred is a normal human woman with no supernatural abilities; her brilliant mathematical mind, immense knowledge of quantum physics and science, and a natural ability in designing inventions make her an important asset of Angel's team; Wesley once says, while addressing most of Angel's crew, \"She's smarter than all of us put together\".  Due to spending so many years in Pylea, she also has a limited knowledge of the Pylean language and culture./nDuring this time, Fred also acquires some reasonably good fighting skills, mainly with weapons such as stakes, guns, swords, knives, etc.  Later, when Jasmine takes over Los Angeles, she's forced to face down all of Los Angeles on her own, and it is shown that she is also able to hold her own unarmed, effortlessly taking out a few armed Jasminites, including one armed SWAT member./nIt's seen in Season Three that she likes plants, actually talking to them during her period of mild insanity.  In the episode \"Spin the Bottle,\" while she's under the effect of a magical spell, Fred is briefly fascinated with a fern.  After undergoing the transformation to Illyria, she can talk to plants while at full power./nFred is also portrayed as an innocent, unassuming young woman, which often leads people to underestimate her.  On many occasions, she has used this to her advantage, such as shocking Connor with a stun gun and knocking out a suspicious lab assistant at Wolfram & Hart or in the third season in \"That Old Gang of Mine\" when she tricks Gunn's old gang into thinking she was going to kill Angel.  Also, she shows signs of great inner strength and an innate ability to survive on her own despite overwhelming circumstances.  This is shown in Season Four as she attempts to flee from Jasmine's followers, and earlier with her experiences in Pylea./nFred has 123 canonical appearances in the Buffyverse./nFred appeared in 70 episodes of television./nFred appeared in 53 canonical issues of comics./nFred also appears in the Angel expanded universe.

The 18th British Combinatorial Conference, held in Sussex in July 2001, was dedicated to his memory.[1]/nHe is known for the Nash-Williams theorem./nHilton[3] writes that \"Themes running through his papers are Hamiltonian cycles, Eulerian graphs, spanning trees, the marriage problem, detachments, reconstruction, and infinite graphs.\"\nIn his first papers Nash-Williams considered the knight's tour and random walk problems on infinite graphs; the latter paper included an important recurrence criterion for general Markov chains, and was also the first to apply electrical network techniques of Rayleigh to random walks. His dissertation, which he finished in 1958, concerned generalizations of Euler tours to infinite graphs.[2][1]/nWelsh writes that his subsequent work defining and characterizing the arboricity of graphs (discovered in parallel and independently by W. T. Tutte) has \"had a huge impact,\" in part because of its implications in matroid theory. Nash-Williams also studied k-edge-connected graphs, Hamiltonian cycles in dense graphs, versions of the reconstruction conjecture for infinite graphs, and the theory of quasi-orders.

His great-grandfather, Grigore Moisil (1814\u20131891), a clergyman, was one of the founders of the first Romanian high school in N\u0103s\u0103ud. His father, Constantin Moisil (1876\u20131958), was a history professor, archaeologist and numismatist; as a member of the Romanian Academy, he filled the position of Director of the Numismatics Office of the Academy. His mother, Elena (1863\u20131949), was a teacher in Tulcea, later the director of \"Maidanul Dulapului\" school in Bucharest (now \"Ien\u0103chi\u021b\u0103 V\u0103c\u0103rescu\" school)./nGrigore Moisil attended primary school in Bucharest, then high school in Vaslui and Bucharest (at Spiru Haret High School\u00a0[ro]) between 1916 and 1922. In 1924 he was admitted to the Civil Engineering School of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest, and also the Mathematics School of the University of Bucharest. He showed a stronger interest in mathematics, so he quit  the Polytechnic University in 1929, despite already having passed all the third-year exams. In 1929 he defended his Ph.D. thesis, La m\u00e9canique analytique des systemes continus (Analytical mechanics of continuous systems), before a commission led by Gheorghe \u021ai\u021beica, with Dimitrie Pompeiu and Anton Davidoglu as members. The thesis was published the same year by the Gauthier-Villars publishing house in Paris, and received favourable comments from Vito Volterra, Tullio Levi-Civita, and Paul L\u00e9vy./nIn 1930 Moisil went to the University of Paris for further study in mathematics, which he finalized the next year with the paper On a class of systems of equations with partial derivatives from mathematical physics. In 1931 he returned to Romania,  where he was appointed in a teaching position at the Mathematics School of the University of Ia\u0219i. Shortly after, he left for a one-year Rockefeller Foundation scholarship to study in Rome. In 1932 he returned to Ia\u0219i, where he remained for almost 10 years, developing a close relationship with professor Alexandru Myller. He taught the first modern algebra course in Romania, named Logic and theory of proof, at the University of Ia\u0219i. During that time, he started writing a series of papers based on the works of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz in multi-valued logic. His research in mathematical logic laid the foundation for significant work done afterwards in Romania, as well as Argentina, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. While in Ia\u0219i, he completed research remarkable for the many new ideas and for his way of finding and using new connections between concepts from different areas of mathematics. He was promoted to Full Professor in November 1939./nIn 1941, a position of professor at the University of Bucharest opened up, and Moisil applied for it. However, Gheorghe Vr\u00e2nceanu, Dan Barbilian, and Miron Nicolescu also applied for the position, and Vr\u00e2nceanu got it.  Moisil approached the Ministry of Education, arguing that it would be a great opportunity for mathematics in Romania if all four could be appointed. As a result of his appeal, all four mathematicians were hired.  Moisil moved to Bucharest, where he became a Professor in the School of Mathematics (later the School of Mathematics and Computer Science) at the University of Bucharest, on 30 December 1941./nFrom 1946 to 1948, Moisil took a leave of absence, being named plenipotentiary envoy to Ankara. While in Turkey, he gave several series of mathematics lectures at Istanbul University and Istanbul Technical University./nIn 1948, he resumed teaching at the University of Bucharest. That same year, he was elected to the Romanian Academy, and a member of the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. After 1965, one of his students,  George Georgescu, worked closely with him on multi-valued logics, and after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, became a Professor of Mathematics and Logic at the same university and department as Moisil in 1991.[1] His student also published extensive, original work on algebraic logic, MV-algebra, algebra, algebraic topology, categories of MV-algebras, category theory and \u0141ukasiewicz\u2013Moisil algebra.[2][3]/nMoisil published papers on mechanics, mathematical analysis, geometry, algebra and mathematical logic. He developed a multi-dimensional extension of Pompeiu's areolar derivative, and studied monogenic functions of one hypercomplex variable with applications to mechanics. Moisil also introduced some many-valued algebras, which he called \u0141ukasiewicz algebras (now also named \u0141ukasiewicz\u2013Moisil algebras), and used them in logic and the study of automata theory. He created new methods to analyze finite automata, and had many contributions to the field of automata theory in algebra./nWhereas Moisil's early contributions were in mathematics, he later devoted his scientific activity to mathematical logic and computer science. He was a professor of mathematical logic and computer science at the University of Bucharest, and he also taught Boolean logic at the Politehnica University of Bucharest.

Through the 1970s, Robinson continued working with Matiyasevich on one of their solution's corollaries, which she once stated that/nthere is a constant N such that, given a Diophantine equation with any number of parameters and in any number of unknowns, one can effectively transform this equation into another with the same parameters but in only N unknowns such that both equations are solvable or unsolvable for the same values of the parameters.[3]/nAt the time the solution was first published, the authors established N = 200. Robinson and Matiyasevich's joint work would produce further reduction to 9 unknowns.[3]/nDuring the late 1940s, Robinson spent a year or so at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica researching game theory. Her 1949 technical report, \"On the Hamiltonian game (a traveling salesman problem),\"[9] is the first publication to use the phrase \"travelling salesman problem\".[10] Shortly thereafter she published a paper called \"An Iterative Method of Solving a Game\" in 1951.[1]:\u200a7\u200a In her paper, she proved that the fictitious play dynamics converges to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. This was posed by George W. Brown as a prize problem at RAND Corporation.[5]:\u200a59/nRobinson was not allowed to teach in the Mathematics Department at Berkeley after marrying Raphael M. Robinson in 1941, as there was a rule that prevented family members from working together in the same department.[1] Robinson then instead stayed in the statistics department despite wanting to teach calculus. \nAlthough Raphael retired in 1973, it wasn't until 1976 she was offered a full-time professorship position at Berkeley after the department heard of her nomination to the National Academy of Sciences.[11]/nAfter Yuri Matiyasevich solved Hilbert's tenth problem by means of the J.R. hypothesis and the Fibonacci number sequence, Saunders Mac Lane nominated Robinson for the National Academy of Sciences.[12] Alfred Tarski and Jerzy Neyman also flew out to Washington, D.C. to further explain to the National Academy of Sciences why her work is so important and how it tremendously contributed to mathematics.[11] In 1975, she was the first female mathematician to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[1]/nRobinson was chosen as the first female president of the American Mathematical Society (for the term of 1983\u20131984) but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia.[13] It took time for her to accept the nomination, as stated in her autobiography:/n\"In 1982 I was nominated for the presidency of the American Mathematical Society. I realized that I had been chosen because I was a woman and because I had the seal of approval, as it were, of the National Academy. After discussion with Raphael, who thought I should decline and save my energy for mathematics, and other members of my family, who differed with him, I decided that as a woman and a mathematician I had no alternative but to accept. I have always tried to do everything I could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians. I found my service as president of the Society taxing but very, very satisfying.\"[3]/nIn 1982, Robinson gave the Noether Lecture of the Association for Women in Mathematics; her lecture was called Functional Equations in Arithmetic.[14] Around this time she also was given the MacArthur Fellowship prize of $60,000. In 1985, she also became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences./nIn the 1950s Robinson was active in local Democratic party activities. She was Alan Cranston's campaign manager in Contra Costa County when he ran for his first political office, state controller.[5][11]/n\"I don\u2019t remember exactly what happened, but the end result was that Julia involved herself during those years in the nitty-gritty of Democratic Party politics\u2014she registered voters, stuffed envelopes, rang door- bells in neighborhoods where people expected to be paid for their vote. She even served as Alan Cranston\u2019s campaign manager for Contra Costa County when he successfully ran for state controller\u2014his first political office.\"/nRobinson was also a volunteer for Adlai Stevenson\u2019s presidential campaigns.[8]/nIn 1984, Robinson was diagnosed with leukemia, and she died in Oakland, California, on July 30, 1985.[1][5]/n\"One of Julia\u2019s last requests was that there be no funeral service and that those wishing to make a gift in her memory contribute to the Alfred Tarski Fund, which she had been instrumental in setting up in honor of her late teacher, friend, and colleague. Modest to the end, she let her character and achievements speak for themselves.\"/nOne of her sisters, Constance Reid, won the Mathematical Association of America's George P\u00f3lya Award in 1987 for writing the article \"The Autobiography of Julia Robinson\".[15][1]:\u200a22/nThe Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival, sponsored by the American Institute of Mathematics from 2013 to the present and by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute from 2007 to 2013, was named in her honor./nGeorge Csicsery produced and directed a one-hour documentary about Robinson titled Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem, that premiered at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Diego on January 7, 2008.[16] Notices of the American Mathematical Society printed a film review[17] and an interview with the director.[18] The College Mathematics Journal also published a film review.[19]", "21596829": "Edmund Stone FRS (c. 1690 \u2013 March or April 1768) was an autodidact Scottish mathematician who lived in London and primarily worked as an editor of mathematical and scientific texts and translator from French and Latin into English. He is especially known for his translations of  Nicholas Bion's Mathematical Instruments (1723, 1758) and the Marquis de l'Hospital's  Analyse des Infiniment Petits (1730), and for his New Mathematical Dictionary (1726, 1743). Stone was celebrated for having risen from uneducated gardener's son to accomplished scholar./nThe date and place of Edmund Stone's birth are unknown, as are the names of his parents, but he was probably born in Argyllshire, Scotland, at least a few years before 1700.[1] What little is known about his early life comes from a letter by Andrew Michael Ramsay to Louis-Bertrand Castel, excerpted by the Journal de Tr\u00e9voux.[2] (See \u00a7\u00a0Appendix: Letter from Ramsay below for the letter and a translation.) According to this letter, Stone was the son of the gardener of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. He never attended any formal school, but after being taught by a servant to read at age 18, he taught himself arithmetic, geometry, Latin, and French. As the story goes, the Duke found a copy of Isaac Newton's Principia in the grass in his garden, and was astonished to find it belonged to the 28-year-old Stone,[3] and that he understood Latin and advanced mathematics. However, Stone's description of himself having studied mathematical instruments from the age of twelve seems inconsistent with this story.[4] The Duke became his patron.[5]/nWith the Duke's support, Stone moved to London c. 1720,[6] where he likely worked as a mathematics tutor.[7] He published translations of the Marquis de l'Hospital's posthumous book about conic sections in 1720 and Christopher Clavius's translation of Theodosius's Spherics in 1721. In 1723 he published a translation of Nicholas Bion's Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments, to which he added descriptions of the English variants of the French instruments described by Bion; this book became the standard reference about the subject in English throughout the 18th century.[8] In 1725 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society,[9] and from 1725 until at least 1736 he was a member of the Board of Green Cloth.[10] His New Mathematical Dictionary appeared in 1726, a cheaper alternative to John Harris's Lexicon Technicum.[11] He also translated Euclid's Elements (1728); l'Hospital's differential calculus book Analyse des Infiniment Petits, to which he adjoined a second part about integral calculus, as The Method of Fluxions (1730);[12] and Isaac Barrow's Geometrical Lectures (1735)./nIn 1736 Stone submitted a paper to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (published 1740) about two cubic plane curves not cataloged by Isaac Newton or James Stirling,[13] but unbeknownst to him the two had been previously published in 1731 by Fran\u00e7ois Nicole and 1733 by Nicolaus Bernoulli, respectively.[14] In 1742 Stone submitted a 21-page paper \"On Sir Isaac Newton's five diverging Parabolas\", which was read to the Society but apparently never published.[15]/nIn 1742, Stone resigned as a Fellow of the Royal Society, perhaps for inability to pay the small annual membership fee.[16] In October 1743 Stone's patron the Duke of Argyll died.[14] Little is known about Stone's life afterward, though he made another translation of Euclid's Elements in 1752, and he published a second edition of Bion's Mathematical Instruments in 1758, with a long appendix covering advancements of the intervening years. In a 1760 review in The Critical Review, Tobias Smollett wrote of Stone's situation, \"His abilities are universally acknowledged, his reputation unblemished, his services to the public uncontested, and yet he lives to an advanced age unrewarded, except by a mean employment that reflects dishonour on the donor\".[17] In 1766 Stone published a contrarian polemic contesting the scientific validity of the spherical shape of the Earth and suggesting contemporary evidence was insufficient to discount the possibility Earth is an irregular roundish polyhedron; biographers have suggested this book was the product of cognitive decline.[18] Stone died in March or April 1768.[19]/nA letter from Andrew Michael Ramsay to Louis-Bertrand Castel was excerpted by the Journal de Tr\u00e9voux 1732, pp. 109\u2013112, as part of a review of Stone's The Method of Fluxions (1730).

Il appella quelqu'un pour le ramasser & le reporter dans la Biblioth\u00e9que./nLe jeune Jardinier lui dit que ce Livre lui appartenoit. A vous, r\u00e9pondit le Mylord?

Mr. Stone is a rare example: born son of the gardener to the Duke of Argyle, he reached the age of 18 years without knowing how to read; his father did not know how to teach him his trade in that elevated way, which makes gardening and agriculture a very useful and very noble part of cosmography and physics./nBy chance, a servant having taught the young Stone the letters of the alphabet, it took nothing further to hatch his genius and to develop it. He applied himself, he studied, he arrived at the knowledge of the most sublime geometry, and of calculation, without master, without conductor, with no other guide than pure genius./nAt the age of 28 years he had made all this progress without being known, and without knowing himself the wonders that happened in him./nMilord Duke of Argyle, who joins to all the military virtues and all the feelings of a hero, a universal knowledge of all that can adorn and perfect the mind of a man of his rank, while walking one day in his garden saw on the grass the famous book of Sir Isaac Newton in Latin. He called someone to pick it up and return it to the library./nThe young gardener told him that this book belonged to him. \"To you?\" replied the Duke. \"Do you understand geometry, Latin, Mr. Newton?\" \"I understand a bit of all that\", replied Stone with an air of simplicity based on profound ignorance of his own talents and the excess of his knowledge./nMilord Duke was very surprised: but as he has the taste for these sciences, he deigned to enter into conversation with the new geometer: he posed several questions to him, and remained astonished at the force, the accuracy, and the candor of his responses./n\"But how\", said the Duke, \"have you come to all this knowledge?\" The other replied, \"a servant taught me, ten years ago, to read: does one need to know anything other than the 24 letters to learn everything one wants?\" The Duke's curiosity redoubled; he suspected that the process of this marvelous genius would be even more surprising than his progress; he sat down on a bench, and asked him to detail all he had done to become skillful./n\"I first learned to read\", said Stone, \"the masons were then working at your house: I approached them one day, and I saw that the architect was using a ruler, a compass, and that he calculated. I asked what he was doing there, and what it was all good for; and I comprehended that there was a science called arithmetic. I bought an arithmetic book, and I learned it./n\"I was told there was another called geometry: I bought books, and I learned geometry. I perceived by way of reading that there were fine books on these two sciences in Latin: I bought a dictionary, and I learned Latin. I also learned that there were fine books of the same kind in French: I bought a dictionary, and I learned French. So you see, Sir, everything I have done, it seems to me that anyone can learn it all when one knows the 24 letters of the alphabet.\"/nThis story charmed milord Duke. He drew this marvelous genius from obscurity; and he provided him with a job that left him all the time to apply himself to the sciences. He discovered in him the same genius for music, for painting, for architecture, for all the sciences that depend on calculation and proportions./nI have seen Mr. Stone. He is a man of admirable simplicity. He now recognizes his own knowledge: but he is not inflated. He is possessed of a pure and disinterested love for geometry. He does not worry about passing for a geometer. Wit and vanity have no part in the infinite labors he undergoes to excel in this subject. He also despises fortune, and has asked me twenty times to entreat milord to give him a lesser job, worth only half the one he has, in order to have more time alone, less distracted from his favorite studies. He sometimes discovers, by his own methods, the same truths that others have already found. He is charmed to see that he is not their inventor, and that men have made more progress than he had supposed. Far from being a plagiarist, he attributes the ingenious and admirable solutions he gives of certain problems to the hints he finds of them in others, even though they only follow by a very circuitous chain of causes, &c.", "38537887": "No\u00ebl Duret or Natalis Durret (1590 in Montbrison, Loire \u2013 1650 in Paris), was a French mathematician and astronomer, cosmographer for King Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu.[1] He was one of the publishers of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te./n/n/nThis biographical article about a French academic is a stub.

He became a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems./nWiener is considered the originator[4] of cybernetics, the science of communication as it relates to living things and machines,[5]/nAfter much consideration, we have come to the conclusion that all the existing terminology has too heavy a bias to one side or another to serve the future development of the field as well as it should; and as happens so often to scientists, we have been forced to coin at least one artificial neo-Greek expression to fill the gap. We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name Cybernetics, which we form from the Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 or steersman./nwith implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work heavily influenced computer pioneer John von Neumann, information theorist Claude Shannon, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and others.\nNorbert Wiener is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms, that could possibly be simulated by machines and was an important early step towards the development of modern artificial intelligence.[6]/nNorbert Wiener .. was one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms. Mechanisms that could possibly be simulated by machines.[6]/nWiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Germany, respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the famous rabbi, philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837.[7]:\u200ap. 4/nLeo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was 7 years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper./nIn \u201cThe Theory of Ignorance\u201d, a paper he wrote at the age of 10, he disputed \u201cman\u2019s presumption in declaring that his knowledge has no limits\u201d, arguing that all human knowledge \u201cis based on an approximation\u201d, and acknowledging \u201cthe impossibility of being certain of anything.\u201d[8]/nHe graduated from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered Tufts College. He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard.  In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.[citation needed]/nThe next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schr\u00f6der with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}./nIn 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. At G\u00f6ttingen he also attended three courses with Edmund Husserl \"one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminary on Phenomenology.\" (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915\u201316, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the Encyclopedia Americana. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.[9]/nAlthough Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.[10] Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, \"I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier.\"[11] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.[12]/nWiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff.[13] He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but as of 2017[update], it has been removed.[14]/nIn 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at G\u00f6ttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems./nIn 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898\u20131973), married mathematician Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married mathematician V\u00e1clav E. Bene\u0161.[15] Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902\u20131995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge./nMany tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness.  It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day.  He thanked her for the information and she replied, \"That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!\"[16]\nAsked about the story, Wiener's daughter reportedly asserted that \"he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened\u2026\"[17]/nIn the run-up to World War II (1939\u201345) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.[18]\nHe was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.[19]/nDuring World War II, his work on the automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process\u2014in other words, as a variety of noise.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with Arturo Rosenblueth and Julian Bigelow the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology', which was published in Philosophy of Science. Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate cybernetics.[20][21] After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.[22]/nWiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.[23]/nWiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s./nAfter the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article \"A Scientist Rebels\" from the January 1947 issue of The Atlantic Monthly[24] urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener.[25]/nWiener was a participant of the Macy conferences./nIn 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at Juniata College.[citation needed] They had two daughters. Opinions are not all positive on Margaret's impacts on Wiener's career.[26]/nWiener admitted in his autobiography I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy to abusing benzadrine throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.[27]/nWiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in Stockholm, from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich, New Hampshire./nInformation is information, not matter or energy./nWiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener's early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.[31]/nWiener is one of the key originators of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, and through them, anthropology, sociology, and education.[32]/nA simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion, the Wiener equation, named after Wiener, assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly./nFor signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the position, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target will have moved, and may have changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel,[citation needed] on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality\u2014a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.[33]\n[34]/nWiener studied polynomial chaos, a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory./nWiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output. The identified system can then be controlled.[35][36]/nWiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown) proving many results now widely known, such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process. It is the best known of the L\u00e9vy processes, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market)./nWiener's tauberian theorem, a 1932 result of Wiener, developed Tauberian theorems in summability theory, on the face of it a chapter of real analysis, by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from harmonic analysis. In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with infinite series; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras, is however a relatively routine process./nThe Paley\u2013Wiener theorem relates growth properties of entire functions on Cn and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support./nThe Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem, (also known as the Wiener \u2013 Khintchine theorem and the Khinchin \u2013 Kolmogorov theorem), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function./nAn abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory, used to construct a \"decent\", strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as classical Wiener space. Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable Banach space./nThe notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and Stefan Banach at around the same time.[37]/nHis work with Mary Brazier is referred to in Avis DeVoto's As Always, Julia.[38]/nA flagship named after him appears briefly in Citizen of the Galaxy by Robert Heinlein.[39]/nThe song Dedicated to Norbert Wiener appears as the second track on the 1980 album Why? by G.G.

He was professor of astronomy at Uppsala University from 1730 to 1744, but traveled from 1732 to 1735 visiting notable observatories in Germany, Italy and France. He founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741, and in 1742 proposed (an inverted form of) the Centigrade temperature scale which was later renamed Celsius in his honour./nAnders Celsius was born in Uppsala, Sweden, on 27 November 1701.[1] His family originated from Ovan\u00e5ker in the province of H\u00e4lsingland.[2] Their family estate was at Doma, also known as H\u00f6jen or H\u00f6gen (locally as H\u00f6gen 2). The name Celsius is a latinization of the estate's name (Latin celsus 'mound')./nAs the son of an astronomy professor, Nils Celsius, nephew of botanist Olof Celsius and the grandson of the mathematician Magnus Celsius and the astronomer Anders Spole,[3][4][page\u00a0needed] Celsius chose a career in science. He was a talented mathematician from an early age. Anders Celsius studied at Uppsala University, where his father was a teacher, and in 1730 he, too, became a professor of astronomy there. Noted Swedish dramatic poet and actor Johan Celsius was also his uncle.[5][6]/nIn 1730, Celsius published the Nova Methodus distantiam solis a terra determinandi (New Method for Determining the Distance from the Earth to the Sun). His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant Olof Hiorter, and he was the first to suggest a connection between the aurora borealis and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth. He observed the variations of a compass needle and found that larger deflections correlated with stronger auroral activity. At Nuremberg in 1733, he published a collection of 316 observations of the aurora borealis made by himself and others over the period 1716\u20131732.[1]/nCelsius traveled frequently in the early 1730s, including to Germany, Italy and France, when he visited most of the major European observatories. In Paris he advocated the measurement of an arc of the meridian in Lapland. In 1736, he participated in the expedition organized for that purpose by the French Academy of Sciences, led by the French mathematician Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1698\u20131759) to measure a degree of latitude.[1] The aim of the expedition was to measure the length of a degree along a meridian, close to the pole, and compare the result with a similar expedition to Peru, today in Ecuador, near the equator. The expeditions confirmed Isaac Newton's belief that the shape of the Earth is an ellipsoid flattened at the poles.[4][page\u00a0needed]/nIn 1738, he published the De observationibus pro figura telluris determinanda (Observations on Determining the Shape of the Earth). Celsius's participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala.[2] He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in 1741.[7] The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period.[3]/nHe made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag).[4][page\u00a0needed][8][9] In 1742 he proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 0 for the boiling point of water and 100 for the freezing point. In 1745, a year after Celsius's death, the scale was reversed by Carl Linnaeus to facilitate more practical measurement.[10]/nCelsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the melting of the ice from the latest ice age. However, he wrongly posed the notion that the water was evaporating.[4][page\u00a0needed]/nIn 1725 he became secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and served at this post until his death from tuberculosis in 1744. He supported the formation of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1739 by Linnaeus and five others, and was elected a member at the first meeting of this academy.

He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard.  In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.[citation needed]/nThe next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schr\u00f6der with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wiener's definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = {{x}, {x, y}}./nIn 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. At G\u00f6ttingen he also attended three courses with Edmund Husserl \"one on Kant's ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminary on Phenomenology.\" (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915\u201316, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the Encyclopedia Americana. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the Boston Herald, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper's owners sought to promote.[9]/nAlthough Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America's entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.[10] Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, \"I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier.\"[11] This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener's return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.[12]/nWiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff.[13] He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood's suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but as of 2017[update], it has been removed.[14]/nIn 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at G\u00f6ttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet's problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems./nIn 1926, Wiener's parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898\u20131973), married mathematician Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener's niece, married mathematician V\u00e1clav E. Bene\u0161.[15] Norbert Wiener's sister, Bertha (1902\u20131995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge./nMany tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness.  It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day.  He thanked her for the information and she replied, \"That's why I stayed behind, Daddy!\"[16]\nAsked about the story, Wiener's daughter reportedly asserted that \"he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened\u2026\"[17]/nIn the run-up to World War II (1939\u201345) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.[18]\nHe was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.[19]/nDuring World War II, his work on the automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (To him is due the now standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process\u2014in other words, as a variety of noise.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with Arturo Rosenblueth and Julian Bigelow the 1943 article 'Behavior, Purpose and Teleology', which was published in Philosophy of Science. Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate cybernetics.[20][21] After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener's wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch's bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.[22]/nWiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.[23]/nWiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others.

He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s./nAfter the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article \"A Scientist Rebels\" from the January 1947 issue of The Atlantic Monthly[24] urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener's beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener.[25]/nWiener was a participant of the Macy conferences./nIn 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at Juniata College.[citation needed] They had two daughters. Opinions are not all positive on Margaret's impacts on Wiener's career.[26]/nWiener admitted in his autobiography I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy to abusing benzadrine throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.[27]/nWiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in Stockholm, from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich, New Hampshire./nInformation is information, not matter or energy./nWiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener's early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.[31]/nWiener is one of the key originators of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, and through them, anthropology, sociology, and education.[32]/nA simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion, the Wiener equation, named after Wiener, assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly./nFor signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. It is necessary to predict the position, because by the time the shell reaches the vicinity of the target, the target will have moved, and may have changed direction slightly. They even modeled the muscle response of the pilot, which led eventually to cybernetics. The unmanned V1's were particularly easy to model, and on a good day, American guns fitted with Wiener filters would shoot down 99 out of 100 V1's as they entered Britain from the English channel,[citation needed] on their way to London. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality\u2014a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener's earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.[33]\n[34]/nWiener studied polynomial chaos, a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory./nWiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output. The identified system can then be controlled.[35][36]/nWiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown) proving many results now widely known, such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process. It is the best known of the L\u00e9vy processes, c\u00e0dl\u00e0g stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market)./nWiener's tauberian theorem, a 1932 result of Wiener, developed Tauberian theorems in summability theory, on the face of it a chapter of real analysis, by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from harmonic analysis. In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with infinite series; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras, is however a relatively routine process./nThe Paley\u2013Wiener theorem relates growth properties of entire functions on Cn and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support./nThe Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem, (also known as the Wiener \u2013 Khintchine theorem and the Khinchin \u2013 Kolmogorov theorem), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function./nAn abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory, used to construct a \"decent\", strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener's original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as classical Wiener space. Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable Banach space./nThe notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and Stefan Banach at around the same time.[37]/nHis work with Mary Brazier is referred to in Avis DeVoto's As Always, Julia.[38]/nA flagship named after him appears briefly in Citizen of the Galaxy by Robert Heinlein.[39]/nThe song Dedicated to Norbert Wiener appears as the second track on the 1980 album Why? by G.G.

Although the field was not formalized until the twentieth century, it is thought that the work of Hero, in particular his automated devices, represented some of the first formal research into cybernetics.[10]/nHero described[11] the construction of the aeolipile (a version of which is known as Hero's engine) which was a rocket-like reaction engine and the first-recorded steam engine (although Vitruvius mentioned the aeolipile in De Architectura some 100 years earlier than Hero). It was described almost two millennia before the industrial revolution. Another engine used air from a closed chamber heated by an altar fire to displace water from a sealed vessel; the water was collected and its weight, pulling on a rope, opened temple doors.[12] Some historians have conflated the two inventions to assert that the aeolipile was capable of useful work, which is not entirely false, air containing a trace of water vapor.

Later he applied those methods in several important papers on the polynomial properties of the Euler characteristic associated with divisor classes of an irreducible normal projective variety. He continued using homological methods in a sequence of papers in which he extended the classical cohomology of groups to the cohomology of arbitrary permutation representations of finite groups. Snapper then applied these methods to obtain a classical result on Frobenius kernels. In the area of combinatorial mathematics, Snapper extended de Bruijn\u2019s theory of the cycle index of a finite group to that of an arbitrary permutation representation.

Later on his ideas were simplified considerably, to the extent that today they are only of historical interest./nK\u0151nig already considered material influences on scientific thinking and the mechanisms which stand behind thinking./nThe foundations of set theory are a formalization and legalization of facts which are taken from the internal view of our consciousness, such that our \"scientific thinking\" itself is an object of scientific thinking./nBut mainly he is remembered for his contributions to and his opposition against set theory./nOne of the greatest achievements of Georg Cantor was the construction of a one-to-one correspondence between the points of a square and the points of one of its edges by means of continued fractions. K\u0151nig found a simple method involving decimal numbers which had escaped Cantor./nIn 1904, at the third International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg, K\u0151nig gave a talk to disprove Cantor's continuum hypothesis. The announcement was a sensation and was widely reported by the press. All section meetings were cancelled so that everyone could hear his contribution./nK\u0151nig applied a theorem proved in the thesis of Hilbert's student Felix Bernstein; this theorem, however, was not as generally valid as Bernstein had claimed. Ernst Zermelo, the later editor of Cantor's collected works, found the error already the next day. In 1905 there appeared short notes by Bernstein, correcting his theorem, and K\u0151nig, withdrawing his claim./nNevertheless, K\u0151nig continued his efforts to disprove parts of set theory. In 1905 he published a paper that claimed to prove that not all sets could be well-ordered./nIt is easy to show that the finitely defined elements of the continuum form a subset of the continuum of cardinality \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}}\n\n. The reason is that such a definition must be given completely by a finite number of letters and punctuation marks, only a finite number of which is available./nThis statement was doubted by Cantor in a letter to Hilbert in 1906:/nInfinite definitions (which are not possible in finite time) are absurdities. If K\u0151nig's claim concerning the cardinality \n\n\n\n\n\u2135\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\aleph _{0}}\n\n of all finitely definable real numbers was correct, it would imply that the whole continuum of real numbers was countable; this is most certainly wrong. Therefore K\u0151nig's assumption must be in error. Am I wrong or am I right?[2]/nCantor was wrong. Today K\u0151nig's assumption is generally accepted. Contrary to Cantor, presently the majority of mathematicians considers undefinable numbers not as absurdities. This assumption leads, according to K\u0151nig,/nin a strangely simple way to the result that the continuum cannot get well-ordered. If we imagine the elements of the continuum as a well-ordered set, those elements which cannot be finitely defined form a subset of that well-ordered set which certainly contains elements of the continuum.  Hence in this well-order there should be a first not finitely definable element, following upon all finitely definable numbers. This is impossible. This number has just been finitely defined by the last sentence. The assumption that the continuum could be well-ordered has led to a contradiction./nK\u0151nig's conclusion is not stringent. His argument does not rule out the possibility that the continuum can be well-ordered; rather, it rules out the conjunction of \"the continuum can be well-ordered by a definition in language L\" and \"the property of being definable in language L is itself definable in language L\". The latter is no longer generally held to be true. For an explanation compare Richard's paradox./nThe last part of his life K\u0151nig spent  working on his own approach to set theory, logic and arithmetic, which was published in 1914, one year after his death. When he died he had been working on the final chapter of the book./nAt first Georg Cantor highly esteemed K\u0151nig. In a letter to Philip Jourdain in 1905 he wrote:/nYou certainly heard that Mr. Julius K\u0151nig of Budapest was led astray, by a theorem of Mr. Bernstein which in general is wrong, to give a talk at Heidelberg, on the international congress of mathematicians, opposing my theorem according to which every set, i.e., every consistent multitude can be assigned an aleph. Anyway, the positive contributions from K\u0151nig himself are well done./nLater on Cantor changed his attitude:/nWhat Kronecker and his pupils as well as Gordan have said against set theory, what K\u0151nig, Poincar\u00e9, and Borel have written against it, soon will be recognized by all as a rubbish./nThen it will show up that Poincar\u00e9's and K\u0151nig's attacks against set theory are nonsense.", "39881417": "Thomas Streicher (born 1958) is an Austrian mathematician who is a Professor of Mathematics at Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt.

He became the leader of the Theoretical Division at the laboratory in 1947, a position he held until 1973. He oversaw the development of new weapons, including the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s.

The Laboratory made great strides in improving the weapons, making them easier to manufacture, stockpile and handle. The Operation Sandstone tests in 1948 demonstrated that uranium-235 could be used in implosion-type nuclear weapons.[6]/nMark played a key role in the development of thermonuclear weapons in the early 1950s. A crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb was approved by President Harry S. Truman in January 1950 at Edward Teller's urging before the laboratory had a workable design.[2] This put the laboratory under great pressure. Hans Bethe recalled that \"There was a lot of controversy in Los Alamos in those days, and Carson always was imperturbable and stood in the middle of it and had a balanced judgment.\"[1] When Stanislaw Ulam finally came up with a workable design, it was Mark that he approached first. Mark took the Ulam design to Bradbury, and they put the idea to Teller. \"Teller then completed and extended the invention,\" Bethe noted, \"so, in this case, Carson was the mediator between two people who really didn't like each other.\"[1] \"Within an hour of Carson's ... remarks,\" Teller recalled, \"I knew how to move ahead\".[5] The Teller-Ulam design would become that of all thermonuclear weapons.[1]/nWhen it came to testing the design in the Ivy Mike nuclear test, Mark again had a crucial go-between role. Bradbury placed Marshall Holloway in charge, but Holloway and Teller did not get along. Mark later recalled that:/nI had to be the link with Holloway, since Teller refused. Bradbury asked me to do it. We [Holloway and I] got along fine. Teller up and left for Chicago without notice. Edward had nothing to do with the final preparations for the Mike shot. He inquired occasionally, but if had tried to help, he would have slowed it down. Bethe did participate. Holloway got the job done with little time to spare. I got along well with Marshall [Holloway] and his \"henchmen\".[7]/nThe Ivy Mike test was successful, obliterating an island in Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific on November 1, 1952.[5]/nFrank Harlow, who joined the Theoretical Division in 1953, and was appointed as a group leader by Mark in 1959, noted that Mark took a personal interest in the computer systems, then a rapidly developing field.[8] As most weapon research in the 1960s no longer involved the Theoretical Division, Mark branched out, sponsoring research into hydrodynamics, neutron physics and transport theory.[5] He also supported Frederick Reines's research into neutrinos, for which Reines was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.[2]/nIn July and August 1958, and again the following year, Mark was a scientific adviser to the United States delegation at the Conference of Experts on Detection of Nuclear Explosions.[1] Delegates from Western and Eastern bloc countries discussed detection methods in the context of negotiations that eventually led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which banned most forms of nuclear testing.[9] He was committed to preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. He spoke at Pugwash Conferences, and wrote a paper dispelling the myth that reactor-grade plutonium could not be used for nuclear weapons.[2][10]/nMark was member of the American Mathematical Society and the American Physical Society,[1] and served on the United States Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board, and its Foreign Weapons Evaluation Group.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Davis, along with American mathematicians Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson made progress toward solving this conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was finally completed in 1970 with the work of Russian mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich. This resulted in the MRDP or the DPRM theorem, named for Davis, Putnam, Robinson, and Matiyasevich.[5] Describing the problem, Davis had earlier mentioned that he found the problem \"irresistibly seductive\" when he was an undergraduate and later had progressively become his \"lifelong obsession\".[7]/nDavis collaborated with Putnam, George Logemann, and Donald W.

She was the youngest child of Dorothy (n\u00e9e Fulford) and the Revd William Kemp Lowther Clarke. She had three brothers and one sister.[3]/nClarke attended Dulwich High School for Girls in south London and won a scholarship in 1936, to attend Newnham College, Cambridge.

The Germans used the Enigma machine to encrypt their messages, which they believed unbreakable./nIn June 1940, Welchman recruited Clarke to the agency.[6][3] She arrived at Bletchley Park on 17 June 1940 and was initially placed in an all-women group, referred to as \"The Girls\", who mainly did routine clerical work.  Clarke said she knew of only one other female cryptologist working at Bletchley Park.[3]/nClarke worked at Bletchley Park in the section known as Hut 8 and quickly became the only female practitioner of Banburismus, a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing which reduced the need for bombes: electromechanical devices as used by British cryptologists Welchman and Turing to decipher German encrypted messages during World War II.[7] Clarke's first work promotion was to Linguist Grade which was designed to earn her extra money despite the fact that she did not speak another language. This promotion was a recognition of her workload and contributions to the team.[3]/nIn 1941, trawlers were captured as well as their cipher equipment and codes. Before this information was obtained, wolf packs had sunk 282,000 tons of shipping a month from March to June 1941. By November, Clarke and her team were able to reduce this number to 62,000 tons.[8] Hugh Alexander, head of Hut 8 from 1943 to 1944, described her as \"one of the best Banburists in the section\".[9][page\u00a0needed] Alexander himself was regarded as the best of the Banburists. He and I. J. Good considered the process more an intellectual game than a job. It was \"not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult enough to cause a nervous breakdown\".[10][full citation needed]/nClarke became deputy head of Hut 8 in 1944,[9][11] although she was prevented from progressing because of her sex, and was paid less than the men.[3] Clarke and Turing had been close friends since soon after they met, and continued to be until Turing's death in 1954. They shared many hobbies and had similar personalities.[1] They became very good friends at Bletchley Park. Turing arranged their shifts so they could work together, and they also spent much of their free time together. In early 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Clarke, and subsequently introduced her to his family. Although he privately admitted his homosexuality to her\u2014she was reportedly unfazed by the revelation\u2014Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage, and broke up with Clarke in mid-1941. Clarke later admitted that she suspected Turing's homosexuality for some time, and it was not much of a surprise when he made the admission to her.[12][13]/nAfter the war, Clarke worked for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). There, in 1947, she met Lieutenant-Colonel John Kenneth Ronald Murray, a retired army officer who had served in India. They were married by the Bishop of Chichester on 26 July 1952 in Chichester Cathedral, where her father was a Canon.[12][13] Shortly after their marriage, John Murray retired from GCHQ due to ill health and the couple moved to Crail in Fife[5] where they lived at Priorscroft, 14 Nethergate.[14] They returned to work at GCHQ in 1962 where Clarke remained until 1977 when she retired aged 60.[3][15]/nFollowing her husband's death in 1986, Clarke moved to Headington, Oxfordshire, where she continued her research into coinage.

Malcolm is a gifted mathematician who specializes in chaos theory. The character was inspired in part by American historian of science James Gleick and French mathematician Ivar Ekeland.[1] In Crichton's 1990 novel Jurassic Park and its 1993 film adaptation, Malcolm is invited by insurance lawyer Donald Gennaro to notice any problems with John Hammond's dinosaur theme park, Jurassic Park. Malcolm was intended by Crichton to fill in the role of the audience in the scenarios he is put through. Malcolm is a secondary protagonist in the original novel and the main protagonist in the sequel, The Lost World, due to positive fan reception from Goldblum's performance as the character in director Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the original novel.[2]/nHis role as Ian Malcolm in Jurassic Park skyrocketed Goldblum's career. Malcolm has become one of Goldblum's most popular characters and has been depicted in many forms of popular culture. The character's signature line, \"Life finds a way\", has become synonymous with Goldblum and the Jurassic Park franchise, and Malcolm has been recognized as the franchise's most enduring character.[3]/nIn Crichton's novel, Dr. Ian Malcolm, along with paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler, is hired as a consultant by InGen CEO John Hammond to provide opinions on Jurassic Park, a theme park on the remote island of Isla Nublar that features genetically recreated dinosaurs. Malcolm is the most pessimistic about the idea of the park, feeling that Hammond and his scientists have not taken the time or effort to fully understand what they are creating. In particular, he points out that Hammond's assertion that the dinosaurs can be controlled through sterilization and managed breeding is foolish since there are far too many unpredictable variables where biology is concerned./nDuring a tour of the park, disgruntled computer programmer Dennis Nedry shuts down power to the park to gain access to dinosaur embryos to sell to a rival. Nedry's actions cause the electrified fences to shut down as well, allowing the dinosaurs to escape from their paddocks. Malcolm is attacked by a Tyrannosaurus rex, which breaks his leg. Malcolm is found by game warden Robert Muldoon and Dr. Ellie Sattler and taken back to one of the lodges to be looked after by park veterinarian Gerry Harding. Harding administers morphine to Malcolm, who spends the rest of the incident ranting about science and philosophy while attempting to assist the other survivors. His condition continues to worsen, and by the time the Costa Rica Air Force arrives to Isla Nublar, Malcolm is said to have died from his injuries.[4][5]/nIn the sequel, The Lost World, it is revealed that the declaration of his death was premature, and Malcolm was able to be saved. Malcolm is upgraded to the main protagonist of the sequel, which begins with him giving a lecture on extinction and chaos theory. It is also stated that Malcolm used to date Sarah Harding, and they have remained friends. Malcolm and Sarah are approached by paleontologist Richard Levine, who wants him to help find a \"Lost World\". Though Malcolm refuses the offer many times, he eventually relents and travels to Isla Sorna. Malcolm injures his leg again during an encounter with another Tyrannosaurus, but survives./nThe film adaptation of Crichton's novel directed by Steven Spielberg features actor Jeff Goldblum in the role of Ian Malcolm. Unlike in the book, Malcolm is never declared dead in the film adaptation, but is severely injured by the Tyrannosaurus. In the film, Malcolm's injury comes from attempting to lure the T. rex away from the car carrying Tim and Lex Murphy, where as in the novel Malcolm's injury came out of cowardice (more akin to the death of Donald Gennaro in the film). This change was suggested by Goldblum.[6] Goldblum reprised his role for the sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in a minor role,[7][8] and alongside Sam Neill (Alan Grant) and Laura Dern (Ellie Sattler) in Jurassic World Dominion.[9][10] Some fans found the personality changes of Malcolm from the first movie to the character seen in The Lost World to be somewhat drastic, and some have speculated that the character suffers from PTSD after his trip to Jurassic Park.[11]/nIn the first film, it is stated that Malcolm has been married several times and has three children. One of his children, Kelly Curtis, appears in The Lost World: Jurassic Park. By the time of the sixth film, he has had two more./nBefore Goldblum was cast, comedic actor Jim Carrey had auditioned for the role of Ian Malcolm. The film's casting director, Janet Hirschenson, believed that Goldblum was the perfect actor for the role, and spoke of Carrey's audition saying Carrey, \"was terrific, too, but I think pretty quickly we all loved the idea of Jeff.\"[12] Actor Cameron Thor had initially auditioned for Malcolm, before landing the role of Dodgson.[13] In the novel, Malcolm states that he only ever wears black so he does not have to put much thought towards what he wears. This is a characteristic shared with an earlier Goldblum character, Seth Brundle from The Fly.[14] Malcolm's line, \"must go faster\", was reused by another Goldblum character, David Levinson in Independence Day.[15]/nGoldblum's portrayal as Ian Malcolm was lauded by fans and critics. Malcolm is the most popular character in the franchise,[16][17] and is one of Goldblum's most popular roles.[18] Goldblum was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal in Jurassic Park alongside Wayne Knight as Dennis Nedry, but both lost to Lance Henriksen in Hard Target.[19] Goldblum was also nominated for a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actor - SciFi for his role in The Lost World: Jurassic Park.[20]/nGoldblum's lack of screen time and over marketing in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was criticized by fans of the franchise, who had felt like the marketing for the film relied too heavily on featuring Goldblum's return as Ian Malcolm, only for the actor to appear in only two short scenes at the start and very end of the film.[21][22][23][24][25] Timothy Donohoo of Comic Book Resources was critical of Malcolm's characterization in Dominion, calling the film his worst appearance in the series. Donohoo wrote that while the first two films depict Malcolm as \"a cynical voice of reason\", Dominion \"reduces him to a source for inane comedy\", opining that Goldblum essentially played himself.[26]/nIan Malcolm has gone on to become one of Goldblum's most iconic and frequently referenced characters. Malcolm and another character, Dr. Henry Wu, have appeared in four films throughout the series, more than any other characters. Malcolm has been referenced in different dinosaur studies,[27] as well as his line, \"Life finds a way\". The quote has become synonymous with the Jurassic Park franchise as well as with Goldblum himself.[28][29][30] The character also reinvigorated an interest in chaos theory, due to a scene where Malcolm flirts with Ellie Sattler while discussing it./nA scene from the first film where Malcolm appears with his shirt open has been widely noted by Goldblum as the primary reason the character was established as a sex symbol, with the pose serving as the subject of many tattoos, Internet memes, a Funko toy figure, as well as receiving a statue in Potters Fields Park in London.[31][32][33]", "1575704": "George Neil Robertson (born November 30, 1938) is a mathematician working mainly in topological graph theory, currently a distinguished professor emeritus at the Ohio State University.[1][2]/nRobertson earned his B.Sc. from Brandon College in 1959 and his Ph.D. in 1969 at the University of Waterloo under his doctoral advisor William Tutte.[3][4]/nIn 1969, Robertson joined the faculty of the Ohio State University, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 1972 and Professor in 1984.

He was also responsible for the Greek rebel's economic affairs.  He represented the island of Crete as a proxy in the Second National Assembly held in Astros Kynourias between 29 March and 18 April 1823.  Giorgios was killed in Gramvousa several years later during the Greek Revolution.  From a young age, Ioannis showed an interest in the sciences.

He briefly returned to Athens and finished a master's degree at the University of Athens.  He studied mathematics and physics.  He excelled in his studies and the Greek government paid for him to complete his studies at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.  In 1842, he traveled to Paris and attended the elite prestigious institutions Ecole Polytechnique (1842) and the Ecole des Mines (1844).  Joseph Bertrand and Auguste Bravais were professors at the Ecole Polytechnique at the time.  Francois Arago was also affiliated with the school and Greek physicist Dimitrios Stroumpos studied at the university a decade earlier.  When Ioannis returned to Greece he was assistant to Georgios Konstantinos Vouris at the National Observatory of Athens.[6]/nIoannis began teaching at the University of Athens in 1850.  He taught astronomy and analysis.[8]  The Greek government was constantly unstable.  The people disliked the new monarch King Otto.  The Greek revolt of 1843 was an important event because all foreign professors were expelled from the University of Athens around the same period.  The world-renowned astronomer Georgios Konstantinos Vouris was Greek-Austrian.  He was from the same country as the King of Greece King Otto.  The University of Athens was constantly drawn into political debate.  Regrettably, Georgios Konstantinos Vouris was the victim of politics. He resigned his position as director of the National Observatory of Athens and moved back to Austria.  Papadakis assumed the position as director for three years from 1855-1858.  The faculty of the University of Athens, Georgios Sinas and his son Simon Sinas pleaded with Vouris to return to the observatory but  Vouris declined.  Simon Sinas and Vouris were allowed to choose his predecessor.  They chose German astronomer Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt.  Papadakis did not want to stay in the position because it was demanding and he was a full-time faculty member at two universities at the time he worked at the University of Athens and the Athens Polytechnic University.[6][9][10]/nDuring the 1850s Papadakis was an assistant to Vouris.  He did extensive meteorological research and published some of his works.  He also helped Vouris conduct his research.  During the same period, he introduced complex descriptive geometry to his students at the university.  Records indicate he taught descriptive geometry at the Athens Polytechnic University from 1853 and 1856.  He taught the new mathematical methods introduced in France.  He influenced Nikolaos Ch. Nikolaidis, Cyparissos Stephanos, Vassilios Lakon and John Hazzidakis.[6]/nPapadakis resigned in protest in 1856 when Joseph Mindler (1808-1868) a Bavarian officer of the Royal court and stenographer of the Parliament was hired to teach stenography.  Mindler was paid a significantly higher salary than Papadakis.  The government in response offered to pay Papadakis higher wages. On 10 May 1859 a political incident rocked the University community when the students were involved in a massive protest called the skiadika (\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac).  Several years later in October 1862, King Otto was exiled to never return to Greece.  \nPapadakis and the college community continued to flourish.  Papadakis became dean of the Philosophical School twice and he also became president of the University of Athens right before his death in the academic year 1876-1877.  He wrote for several publications in Greece.\nHe wrote about his observations of the moons of Jupiter and published it in the Greek paper Logodos (\u039b\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2).

He was also an adjunct professor at Rutgers University from 1984 to 1987 and at the University of Waterloo from 1988 to 1993. He became professor at Princeton University in 1996.[5] He is Editor-in-Chief (jointly with Carsten Thomassen) for the Journal of Graph Theory,[6] and an editor for Combinatorica[7] and the Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B.[8]/nHe married Shelley MacDonald of Ottawa in 1979, and they have two children, Amy and Emily. The couple separated amicably in 2007.[citation needed] His brother Leonard W. Seymour is Professor of gene therapy at Oxford University.[9]/nCombinatorics in Oxford in the 1970s was dominated by matroid theory, due to the influence of Dominic Welsh and Aubrey William Ingleton. Much of Seymour's early work, up to about 1980, was on matroid theory, and included three important matroid results: his D.Phil. thesis on matroids with the max-flow min-cut property[pub 1] (for which he won his first Fulkerson prize); a characterisation by excluded minors of the matroids representable over the three-element field;[pub 2] and a theorem that all regular matroids consist of graphic and cographic matroids pieced together in a simple way[pub 3] (which won his first P\u00f3lya prize). There were several other significant papers from this period: a paper with Welsh on the critical probabilities for bond percolation on the square lattice;[pub 4] a paper on edge-multicolouring of cubic graphs,[pub 5] which foreshadows the matching lattice theorem of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz; a paper proving that all bridgeless graphs admit nowhere-zero 6-flows,[pub 6] a step towards Tutte's nowhere-zero 5-flow conjecture; and a paper solving the two-paths problem (also introducing the cycle double cover conjecture),[pub 7] which was the engine behind much of Seymour's future work./nIn 1980 he moved to Ohio State University, and began work with Neil Robertson. This led eventually to Seymour's most important accomplishment, the so-called \"Graph Minors Project\", a series of 23 papers (joint with Robertson), published over the next thirty years, with several significant results:\nthe graph minors structure theorem, that for any fixed graph, all graphs that do not contain it as a minor can be built from graphs that are essentially of bounded genus by piecing them together at small cutsets in a tree structure;[pub 8]\na proof of a conjecture of Wagner that in any infinite set of graphs, one of them is a minor of another (and consequently that any property of graphs that can be characterised by excluded minors can be characterised by a finite list of excluded minors);[pub 9]\na proof of a similar conjecture of Nash-Williams that in any infinite set of graphs, one of them can be immersed in another;[pub 10]\nand polynomial-time algorithms to test if a graph contains a fixed graph as a minor, and to solve the k vertex-disjoint paths problem for all fixed k.[pub 11]/nIn about 1990 Robin Thomas began to work with Robertson and Seymour. Their collaboration resulted in several important joint papers over the next ten years:\na proof of a conjecture of Sachs, characterising by excluded minors the graphs that admit linkless embeddings in 3-space;[pub 12]\na proof that every graph that is not five-colourable has a six-vertex complete graph as a minor (the four-colour theorem is assumed to obtain this result, which is a case of Hadwiger's conjecture);[pub 13]\nwith Dan Sanders, a new, simplified, computer based proof of the four-colour theorem;[pub 14]\nand a description of the bipartite graphs that admit Pfaffian orientations.[pub 15]\nIn the same period, Seymour and Thomas also published several significant results: (with Noga Alon) a separator theorem for graphs with an excluded minor,[pub 16] extending the planar separator theorem of Richard Lipton and Robert Tarjan; a paper characterizing treewidth in terms of brambles;[pub 17] and a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the branch-width of planar graphs.[pub 18]/nIn 2000 Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas were supported by the American Institute of Mathematics to work on the strong perfect graph conjecture, a famous open question that had been raised by Claude Berge in the early 1960s. Seymour's student Maria Chudnovsky joined them in 2001, and in 2002 the four jointly proved the conjecture.[pub 19] Seymour continued to work with Chudnovsky, and obtained several more results about induced subgraphs, in particular (with Cornu\u00e9jols, Liu, and Vu\u0161kovi\u0107) a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a graph is perfect,[pub 20] and a general description of all claw-free graphs.[pub 21] Other important results in this period include: (with Seymour's student Sang-il Oum) fixed-parameter tractable algorithms to approximate the clique-width of graphs (within an exponential bound) and the branch-width of matroids (within a linear bound);[pub 22] and (with Chudnovsky) a proof that the roots of the independence polynomial of every claw-free graph are real.[pub 23]/nIn the 2010s Seymour worked mainly on \u03c7-boundedness and the Erd\u0151s\u2013Hajnal conjecture. In a series of papers with Alex Scott and partly with Chudnovsky, they proved two conjectures of Andr\u00e1s Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s, that every graph with bounded clique number and sufficiently large chromatic number has an induced cycle of odd length at least five,[pub 24] and has an induced cycle of length at least any specified number.[pub 25] The series culminated in a paper of Scott and Seymour proving that for every fixed k, every graph with sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a large complete subgraph or induced cycles of all lengths modulo k,[pub 26] which leads to the resolutions of two conjectures of Gil Kalai and Roy Meshulam connecting the chromatic number of a graph with the homology of its independence complex. There was also a polynomial-time algorithm (with Chudnovsky, Scott, and Chudnovsky and Seymour's student Sophie Spirkl) to test whether a graph contains an induced cycle with length more than three and odd.[pub 27] Most recently, the four jointly resolved the 5-cycle case of the Erd\u0151s\u2013Hajnal conjecture, which says that every graph without an induced copy of the 5-cycle contains an independent set or a clique of polynomial size.[pub 28]", "43158300": "Alexander Murray Macbeath (30 June 1923 Glasgow \u2013 14 May 2014 Warwick)[1][2][3] was a mathematician who worked on Riemann surfaces.

His father, Edward Henry Lorenz (1882-1956), majored in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his maternal grandfather, Lewis M. Norton, developed the first course in chemical engineering at MIT in 1888. Meanwhile, his mother, Grace Peloubet Norton (1887-1943), instilled in Lorenz a deep interest in games, particularly chess.[6]/nLater in life, Lorenz lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts with his wife, Jane Loban, and their three children, Nancy, Cheryl, and Edward.[7] He was an avid outdoorsman, who enjoyed hiking, climbing, and cross-country skiing. He kept up with these pursuits until very late in his life. On April 16, 2008, Lorenz died at his home in Cambridge from cancer at the age of 90.[8]/nLorenz received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Dartmouth College in 1938 and a master's degree in mathematics from Harvard in 1940. He worked as a weather forecaster for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, leading him to pursue graduate studies in meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[7] He earned both a master's and doctoral degree in meteorology from MIT in 1943 and 1948./nHis doctoral dissertation, titled \"A Method of Applying the Hydrodynamic and Thermodynamic Equations to Atmospheric Models\" and performed under advisor James Murdoch Austin, described an application of fluid dynamical equations to the practical problem of predicting the motion of storms.[9]/nLorenz spent the entirety of his scientific career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1948, he joined the MIT Department of Meteorology as a research scientist. In 1955, he became an assistant professor in the department and was promoted to professor in 1962. From 1977 to 1981, Lorenz served as head of the Department of Meteorology at MIT. In 1983, the MIT Department of Meteorology and Physical Oceanography merged with the Department of Geology to become the current MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, where Lorenz remained a professor before becoming an emeritus professor in 1987.[10]/nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lorenz worked with Victor Starr on the General Circulation Project at MIT to understand the role the weather system played in determining the energetics of the general circulation of the atmosphere. From this work, in 1967, Lorenz published a landmark paper, titled \"The Nature and Theory of the General Circulation of the Atmosphere,\" on atmospheric circulation from an energetic perspective, which advanced the concept of available potential energy.[11]/nIn the 1950s, Lorenz became interested in and started work on numerical weather prediction, which relied on computers to forecast weather by processing observational data on such things as temperature, pressure, and wind.  This interest was sparked, in part, after a visit to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he met Jule Charney, then head of the IAS's Meteorological Research Group and a leading dynamical meteorologist at the time.[12] (Charney would later join Lorenz at MIT in 1957 as a professor of meteorology.)[13] In 1953, Lorenz took over leadership of a project at MIT that ran complex simulations of weather models that he used to evaluate statistical forecasting techniques.[12] By the late 1950s, Lorenz was skeptical of the appropriateness of the linear statistical models in meteorology, as most atmospheric phenomena involved in weather forecasting are non-linear.[2] It was during this time that his discovery of deterministic chaos came about.[14]/nIn 1961, Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a Royal McBee LGP-30, to simulate weather patterns by modeling 12 variables, representing things like temperature and wind speed. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather that the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. The culprit: a rounded decimal number on the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term results.[15]/nLorenz's discovery, which gave its name to Lorenz attractors, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions. His work on the topic, assisted by Ellen Fetter, culminated in the publication of his 1963 paper \"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow\" in Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, and with it, the foundation of chaos theory.[2][14] He states in that paper:/n\"Two states differing by imperceptible amounts may eventually evolve into two considerably different states ... If, then, there is any error whatever in observing the present state\u2014and in any real system such errors seem inevitable\u2014an acceptable prediction of an instantaneous state in the distant future may well be impossible....In view of the inevitable inaccuracy and incompleteness of weather observations, precise very-long-range forecasting would seem to be nonexistent.\"/nHis description of the butterfly effect, the idea that small changes can have large consequences, followed in 1969.[2][16][17][18][19][20][21]/nIn the book \"The Essence of Chaos,\" in the chapter \"Our Chaotic Weather\" from 1993, authored by Edward Lorenz and Krzysztof Haman, the authors delved into the challenges of weather forecasting. The work discusses the consequences of chaos in the atmosphere and its impact on weather prediction. They describe a scenario in which meteorologists, in the computer age, generate multiple long-term weather forecasts based on different yet similar initial atmospheric conditions. Differences in the forecast results arise due to the sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. \n[22]/nLorenz's insights on deterministic chaos resonated widely starting in the 1970s and 80s, when it spurred new fields of study in virtually every branch of science, from biology to geology to physics. In meteorology, it led to the conclusion that it may be fundamentally impossible to predict weather beyond two or three weeks with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, the recognition of chaos has led to improvements in weather forecasting, as now forecasters recognize that measurements are imperfect and thus run many simulations starting from slightly different conditions, called ensemble forecasting.[23]/nOf the seminal significance of Lorenz's work, Kerry Emanuel, a prominent meteorologist and climate scientist at MIT, has stated:[8]/n\"By showing that certain deterministic systems have formal predictability limits, Ed put the last nail in the coffin of the Cartesian universe and fomented what some have called the third scientific revolution of the 20th century, following on the heels of relativity and quantum physics.\"/nLate in his career, Lorenz began to be recognized with international accolades for the importance of his work on deterministic chaos. In 1983, along with colleague Henry Stommel, he was awarded the Crafoord Prize from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, considered to be nearly equal to a Nobel Prize.[8] He was also awarded the Kyoto Prize for basic sciences in the field of earth and planetary sciences in 1991,[24] the Buys Ballot Award in 2004, and the Tomassoni Award in 2008.[25] In 2018, a short documentary was made about Lorenz's immense scientific legacy on everything from how we predict weather to our understanding of the universe.[26]/nLorenz is remembered by colleagues and friends for his quiet demeanor, gentle humility, and love of nature.[12] He was described as \"a genius with a soul of an artist\" by his close friend and collaborator Jule Charney.[13]/nIn 2011, The Lorenz Center, a climate think tank devoted to fundamental scientific inquiry, was founded at MIT in honor of Lorenz and his pioneering work on chaos theory and climate science.[27]/nIn February 2018, The Edward Lorenz Center and Henry Houghton Fund hosted a symposium, named MIT on Chaos and Climate, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Lorenz and Charney.[13] The two-day event featured presentations from world-renowned experts on the many scientific contributions that the two pioneers made on the fields of numerical weather prediction, physical oceanography, atmospheric dynamics, and experimental fluid dynamics, as well as the personal legacy they left behind of integrity, optimism, and collaboration. A video produced for the event highlights the indelible mark made by Charney and Lorenz on MIT and the field of meteorology as a whole.[28]/nLorenz published many books and articles, a selection of which can be found below.

Board of Education decision, desegregating public schools, he was allowed to attend the formerly-all-white secondary schools in Alice, beginning in the ninth grade.

He was a student of Philipp Apian and was known as the teacher who most influenced Kepler. Maestlin was considered to be one of the most significant astronomers between the time of Copernicus and Kepler.[2]/nMaestlin was born on September 30, 1550, in G\u00f6ppingen, a small town in Southern Germany, about 50 kilometers east of T\u00fcbingen. The son of Jakob Maestlin and Dorothea Simon, Michael Maestlin was born into a Protestant family.[3] Maestlin had an older sister named Elisabeth and a younger brother named Matth\u00e4us. The original family name of the Maestlin was Leckher or Legecker and they lived in the village of Boll, just a few kilometers south of G\u00f6ppingen (Decker 103).[4] In his autobiography, Maestlin recounts how the family name of Legecker became M\u00e4stlin.[4] He claims that one of his ancestors was given this as a nickname when an old blind woman touched him and exclaimed \"Wie bist du doch so mast und feist! Du bist ein rechter M\u00e4stlin!\" This roughly translates to \"How are you so large and plump? You rightly are a fatso!\"[4]/nMaestlin married Margarete Gr\u00fcniger on 9 April 1577.[3] There is little information on his children from this marriage. However, it is known that he had at least three sons, Ludwig, Michael and Johann Georg, and at least three daughters, Margareta, Dorothea Ursula and Anna Maria. In 1588, Margarete died at the age of 37, potentially due to complications from child birth.[3] This untimely death left several children under Maestlin's care and could have influenced his decision to remarry the following year. In 1589, Maestlin married Margarete Burkhardt. Maestlin and Burkhardt had eight children together. In a 1589 letter to Johannes Kepler, Maestlin recounts how the death of his month-old son, August, deeply troubled him.[3]/nIn 1565, when Michael was around 15 years old, he was sent to the nearby Klosterschule in K\u00f6nigbronn.[3] In 1567, Michael transferred to a similar school in Herrenalb.[5] Upon finishing his education at Herrenalb, Maestlin enrolled in university, matriculating on 3 December 1568 at the University of T\u00fcbingen.[6][3] When Maestlin entered the university in 1569 he did so as one of the beneficiaries of a scholarship from the duke of W\u00fcrttemberg.[7] He studied theology at the T\u00fcbinger Stift, which was founded in 1536 by Duke Ulrich von W\u00fcrttemberg, and was regarded as an elite institution of education.[8] He obtained his Baccalaureate in 1569 and his master's degree in 1571.[3] After receiving his master's degree Maestlin remained at the university as a student in theology and as a tutor in the theological seminary church located in W\u00fcrttemberg.[7] In letters sent to Maestlin regarding his qualifications, it was revealed that he graduated summa cum laude and ranked third in his graduating class of twenty.[3] During the time he spent on earning his master's degree, Maestlin studied under Philipp Apian.[9] It is not certain, but it is believed that Apian taught courses on Frisius's Arithmetic, Euclid's Elements, Proclus's Sphera, Peurbach's Theoricae Novae Planetarus, and the proper use of geodetic instruments.[3] Apian's teachings evidently influenced Maestlin's paper on sundials as the contents of this essay involve elements of structured celestial globes and maps.[3]/nIn 1584, Maestlin was named Professor of Mathematics at T\u00fcbingen. He was elected Dean of the Arts Faculty for the following terms: 1588-89, 1594\u201395, 1600\u201301, 1607\u201309, 1610\u201311, 1615, 1623, and 1629.[3] Maestlin taught trigonometry and astronomy. It was very likely that he used his book Epitome Astronomiae in his lectures.[citation needed]/nIn 1576 Maestlin had been sent to be a deacon at the Lutheran church in Backnang, a town about 30 kilometers Northwest of G\u00f6ppingen. While there, he observed a comet that appeared in 1577. Tycho Brahe in Denmark observed the same comet, and from observations of its parallax, both Tycho and Maestlin were able to determine that the comet must be above the Moon, contrary to the astronomical theories of both Aristotle and Ptolemy. Maestlin concluded that, in the Copernican system, the comet must lie in a region between the sphere of Venus and that of the Earth and Moon.[10] Maestlin served as the Duke's chief scientific adviser from 1577 to 1580.[3]/nMaestlin studied theology, mathematics, and astronomy/astrology at the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2014the T\u00fcbinger Stift. (T\u00fcbingen was part of the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg.) He graduated as magister in 1571 and became in 1576 a Lutheran deacon in Backnang, continuing his studies there.[citation needed]/nIn 1580 he became a professor of mathematics, first at the University of Heidelberg, then at the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he taught for 47 years from 1583. In 1582 Maestlin wrote a popular introduction to astronomy.[citation needed] While teaching at the university Maetslin tho a Copernican taught traditional Ptolemaic astronomy in his courses. However, Maestlin did present Copernican's heliocentric astronomy to his advanced students.[11]/nAmong his students was Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) who considered Maestlin not only a teacher, but also a lifelong mentor.[12] Although he primarily taught the traditional geocentric Ptolemaic view of the Solar System, Maestlin was also one of the first to accept and teach the heliocentric Copernican view.[12] Maestlin corresponded with Kepler frequently and played a sizable part in his adoption of the Copernican system. Galileo Galilei's adoption of heliocentrism was also attributed to Maestlin.[13]/nThe first known calculation [14] of the (inverse) golden ratio as a decimal of \"about 0.6180340\" was written in 1597 by Maestlin on a letter he got from to Kepler about Kepler triangle[15]/nMichael Maestlin was one of the very few astronomers of the sixteenth century that fully adopted the Copernican hypothesis, that proposed that the Earth was a planet and that it moved around the Sun. 1570 he acquired an edition of his main work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (his edition with many commentaries is in Schaffhausen).[16] Maestlin reacted to the thought of distant stars spinning around a fixed Earth every 24 hours and taught everything that he could about Copernicus to Kepler.[17]/nIn November 1572 Maestlin and many others around the world witnessed a strange light in the sky that we now know was a galactic supernova.[18] Maestlin attempted to explain this phenomenon in his tract entitled Demonstratio astronomica loci stellae novae, tum respectu centri mundi, tum respectu signiferi & aequinoctialis. This tract of Maestlin's was a short mathematical and  astronomical appendix detailing the nova and was published in T\u00fcbingen in March or April of 1573.[18] This nova was called the Nova of Cassiopeia and was the first galactic supernova to be observed in Europe.[18] Maestlin's treatise attracted the attention of Tycho Brahe, who reproduced it in  its entirety, along with his criticism, in one of the best known publications on the nova, in his posthumously printed Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata.[18] Maestlin's treatise is available in manuscript format in Stuttgart and  in Marburg.[18]/nThe programme of Maestlin's treatise of 1573 over the supernova was practically identical to that of Tycho Brahe's longer treatise De stella nova, which published in the same year two or three months later. Tycho's Progymnasmata, was also nearly identical to Maestlin's treaties, which was finished latter in 1592 but published only in 1602, a year after Tycho Brahe's death.[18]/nMaestlin in following the copernicium Solar System believed that the \"movement of commutation\" (or \"parallactic motion\") of the superior planets, those being planets with a farther distance from the Sun compared to the Earth, and the lack of parallactic motion in the nova meant that the nova had to occur outside the planetary rings and in the ring of fixed stars. This nova occurring in the ring of fixed stars contradicted the previous understandings of Ptolemaic and Aristotelian. Maestlin also concluded that the nova helped to prove the heliocentric Solar System as he said unless people concede that comets can be placed in the stellar orb, whose altitude is immense and whose extension we do not know, to which also the distance between the Sun and the Earth is incomparable, as witnessed by Copernicus.[18]/nIn 1580, Maestlin observed another comet and began to gather up some ideas on how it formed. Nine years later in 1589, Maestlin shared his conclusions about the appearance of the comet with his friend the astrologer, Helisaeus Roeslin, who said that the Moon was located in front of the Great Comet of 1577, Also this same year, Maestlin published a dissertation on the fundamental principles of astronomy and the first edition of his book Epitome Astronomiae (Epitome of Astronomy).[3] Epitome Astonomiae consisted of six editions and used works like Ptolemy's famous geocentric model to create his descriptions of astronomy.[citation needed]/nThe preface in the 1596 republication of Rheticus' Narratio Prima was also written by Maestlin. This preface was an introduction to the work of Copernicus. Additionally, Maestlin made many contributions to tables and diagrams in Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum. Kepler's publication of Mysterium Cosmographicum was supervised by Maestlin, in which he added his own appendix to the publication over Copernican planetary theory with help from Erasmus Reinhold's Prutenic Tables.[19] The information Maestlin used for his appendix from the Prutenic Tables, by Erasmus Reinhold, was used to help readers that were not well educated in astronomy to be able to read Johannes Kepler's Mysterium Cosmographicum as not much information over the basics was included.[20] A discussion of the great sphere and the lunar sphere, as well as more discussion and conclusions to his descriptions of the Copernican planetary theory was also added by Maestlin in Kepler's book.[19] Maestlin's appendix was written more than once, and in the final version he wrote the appendix in correspondence to \"the needs of a hypothetical educated reader\". However, Maestlin also answered the questions Kepler had while writing the Mysterium Cosmographicum in his appendix.[20]/nMaestlin and Kepler communicated through a series of letters about Kepler's book the Mysterium Cosmographim  in which Maestlin added his appendix \"On the Dimensions of the Heavenly Circles and Spheres, according to the Prutenic tables after the theory of Nicolaus Copernicus\" This appendix contained a set of planetary distances in addition to a method of deriving them from the Prutenic tables. Maestlin also added his own understanding of Nicolaus Copernicus' geometry to Kepler's book. When. Maestlin and Kepler were communicating through letters regarding Kepler's book they discussed such topics such as the inaccuracy of the values that Copernicus used when calculating the spheres of the cosmos.[21]/nWith the help of Maestlin in 1595, Kepler believed that he had discovered the relationship between the planets period and the distance from the Sun. He did so by first assuming equal velocity of each planet and then observing that the planets did not just revolve just according to the length of their radii. Kepler observed that the Sun exerted a force that was progressively attenuated as planets are farther and farther away from the Sun itself. Maestlin even provided the geometry to help visualize Kepler's theory of the Sun force and its effects of the other planets.[21]/nWhile frequent in communication with Kepler through the form of letters during the years 1594 to 1600, Maestlin appeared to quit the dialogue with his former student. Kepler, eager to keep the conversation alive, wrote more letters to which he would receive no response. This lasted between the years of 1600 to 1605. It is said that Maestlin's period of silence ensued due to his fear that Kepler would publish their letters of correspondence. There have been other reasons speculated as to why Maestlin cut off communication with his disciple Kepler including a personal crisis in reaction to rumors of his own suicide. Kepler, frustrated with his teacher's refusal to continue their written communication, complained in a letter dated December 14, 1604, to respond about his thoughts on the nova recently discovered and highly discussed. To not write about this event would to Kepler make Maestlin guilty of \"crime of deserting astronomy\". Maestlin finally began talking again the month after this letter, around the end of January 1605. In this letter he accomplished several things. He first explained and gave reason to his silence as being because there was nothing more of use to add to the prior explanations concerning the questions Kepler had addressed to him. In regard to the nova, he deduced that it was in fact just a star that had previously not been discovered or noticed.[2]/nWhile Maestlin had many interests like calendar reform and mathematics, he was above all, an astronomer. He spent much time researching the Sun, Moon, and eclipses. His 1596 work, Disputatio de Eclipsibus is almost entirely about the Sun and the Moon and is often referred to in Kepler's 1604 work, Astronomiae pars optica .[3] In 1587, Maestlin published a manuscript entitled Tabula Motus Horarii in which he gives the daily motion of the Sun in hours and minutes with its positions in two-minute intervals. There are a few other tables he published that gives equivalent information but in degrees, minutes, and seconds.[3]/nMaestlin is also responsible for adding an appendix to Kepler's Mysterium and, based on correspondence with Kepler, which he had frequently, he is known to have been more involved in the editing process of its creation. Maestlin and his former student, Kepler, have been known to have had frequent correspondence via letters, however, there was a time when Maestlin stopped responding to Keplers messages. When he finally started responding to Kepler's letters again, he explained his silence in that he wouldn't have been able to add anything of meaning to Kepler's requests for help with his work, however, this Maestlin would prove his own statement wrong by being greatly involved in Kepler's work in the future.[2] Maestlin was involved in Kepler's Mysterium in that he added diagrams of his views on the order of the planets and the spacing between them to clarify his point. This was the first time such a thing had been done.[22] These very diagrams are what caused a misunderstanding that lasted over centuries. Maestlin did not make it clear whether the planets were supposed to be moving on the lines of the circles that were supposed to represent his planetary system, or whether they were meant to be moving within the spaces drawn by Maestlin.[22] This led to many people believing that the planetary system suggested by Copernicus included a smaller number of modifications (such as epicycles) than that of Ptolemy, when the very opposite was the case.[22] Despite the confusion these diagrams caused, Maestlin contributed greatly to Kepler's Mysterium, which even lead Kepler so far as to acknowledge Maestlin's co-authoring the book in a letter Maestlin.[23]/nMaestlin's added appendix also contained more than just the set of planetary distances and their methods of derivation from the tables of corrections. On top of this, he included an assessment of the Copernican models, including his understanding of the geometry behind these models for the Earth, Moon, and other planets. In what would be the final form of the appendix Maestlin also discusses his student, Kepler, and the quality of his findings and knowledge on the subject of astronomy.[24]/nMaestlin's treatise on the nova of 1572 featured many aspects extremely similar to Tycho de Brahe's much longer treatise on the same nova titled De Stella Nova. Both were published the same year, 1602, even though Maestlin's was thought to be written much earlier. In this treatise, Maestlin focused extensively on the mathematics behind the new star's exact location.[18][25]/nIn accordance to the Copernican view of the heavens, Johannes Kepler calculated there to be empty spaces between the planetary orbs of the heavens, and Maestlin suggested that these empty spaces might be where comets frequently occur.[10] This sort of revelation was only possible under the assumption of a heliocentric universal organization. Maestlin is believed to have come to this heliocentric view after observing the path of a comet in 1577.[10] When that comet appeared, Maestlin, along with the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe were the first people who actively tried to calculate its path in a more complex way than simply track its path in the sky.[10] Tycho Brahe and Maestlin in tracking the comet deduced that the comet was not only travelling across the sky but it was going through Aristotle's and Ptolemy's solid geocentric orbs suggesting that the spheres of planets were not solid as previous astronomers believed.[11]/nIn 1604, Maestlin was one of the first astronomers able to observe the 1604 Supernova (later dubbed Kepler's Supernova) on 9 October 1604. He made his observations visually without instruments and took intense personal note of his observations, however, did not immediately publish them. Instead, he began working on a treatise, entitled Consideratio Astronomica inusitatae Novae et prodigiosae Stellae, superiori 1604 anno, sub initium Octobris, iuxta Eclipticam in signo Sagittarii vesperi exortae, et adhuc nunc eodem loco lumine corusco lucentis (Astronomical consideration of the extraordinary and prodigious new star that appeared near the ecliptic in the sign of Sagittarius one evening in early October in the preceding year 1604, and continues to shine in the same place with a tremulous light) with the intent to publish it in the coming years. He began seriously working on the treatise in 1606, however, it was never fully completed.[2]/nIn 1613, Maestlin obtained his first set of telescopes. In a letter to Kepler, Maestlin says he was unable to view the satellites of Saturn or the phases of Venus, however, he was able to see the moons of Jupiter.[3]/nA conference was held in Tubingen (where Maestlin was a professor at the university) in 2000 on Maestlin and his life and works. From these, Gerhard Betsch produced a collective volume on their findings and breakdown of his works as well as a summary of Maestlin's nachlass, a german word meaning collection of manuscripts, notes, letters, correspondence, etc. left behind when a scholar passes. His nachlass had been kept and preserved among different library archives in both Germany and Austria. Betsch discussed many things in his dissertation including a treatise composed by Maestlin on the Comet of 1618-1619 written completely in German. An important work Betsch failed to mention was Maestlin's treatise on the Comet of 1604. This work, written completely in Latin this time, was titled \"Consideratio Astronomica inusitatae Novae et prodigiosae Stellae, superiori 1604 anno, sub initium Octobris, iuxta Eclipticam in signo Sagittarii vesperi exortae, et adhuc nunc eodem loco lumine corusco lucentis\". Or in english, \"Astronomical consideration of the extraordinary and prodigious new star that appeared near the ecliptic in the sign of Sagittarius one evening in early October in the preceding year 1604, and continues to shine in the same place with a tremulous light\". The work consisted of a view of his thoughts on the comet and extends just over 12 pages but is problematic to read. There are many cancellations and additions as well as notes and marks on words. The work is also unfinished which leads scholars to believe either Maestlin failed to finish or the final pages have been lost sometime in the past centuries. The best estimated date for his treatise has been noted as April 1605. Maestlin describes the months of February or March when the comet showed signs of decreasing intensity and brightness. He estimated its expiration or disappearance for May of the same year. His reasoning for this estimation came from the fact that the Sun would be in opposition with the nova at this point in time. He discusses extensively the intensity and magnitude of the nova and how it differs from the patterns seen in previous novas such as that of 1572. This comet of 1572 was first seen at a certain magnitude and like others before and after it, experienced a constant decreasing throughout its visibility. This comet of 1604 however, maintained a large magnitude for sometime as a first-magnitude star like that of Venus and the other brightest stars.[2]/nDuring the days of Maestlin and Kepler, it could be considered dangerous business to be questioning God's responsibility for creating the world and all the creatures in it, because one might be accused of blasphemy. Maestlin saw things in a different light, however. He was a follower of the Lutheran church, and as such, he believed that studying the natural world and unraveling the laws that embody it will bring humanity closer to God. In Maestlin's opinion, understanding God's creations will enable his children to be closer to him and his divine plan. He further believed that finding out more about the natural world we live in will enrich the knowledge we have of God.[26] Maestlin at one time had even been a Lutheran pastor.[27]/nMichael Maestlin used his notability to project his religious and political views. In 1582, Maestlin voiced his view in treaties on the new Gregorian calendar and its creation.[28]  His arguments focused on mathematics perceptive and political perceptive. He agreed that Julian calendar was inaccurate and that it states a year to be 365 days and 6 hours long, but as Maestiling said, the year is \"365 days, five hours, forty-nine minutes and 46 thirds long\".[28] Also, he discusses that the golden numbers are calculated wrong.[28] While his argument with mathematics mostly supports the replacement of the Julian calendar, his argument for political reasons differ. Maestlin was against the adoption of the Gregorian calendar even though he believed there was a need for a new accurate calendar.[28] He argues that the need for a new calendar was known for two hundred years, but nothing was done.[28] He suggested that the reason that calendar was being adopted now was because the catholic church lost power, and the Pope wanted \"to further his dominion\".[29] This stems from Maestlin's dislike of the position of the Pope, which is shown by his statement, the Pope does not direct \"the movements of the sun and moon\".[28] Maestlin believed that the Pope was trying to project power into countries that rather recently rid the Pope's powers.[28] Then he suggested that only educated people would notice the problems with the calendar.[28] He believed the judgment day in the year 2000, which with the Julian calendar is an inaccuracy of three days.[28] So he does not believe the correction is worth it.[28]/nIn Jules Verne's Cinq semaines en ballon (Five Weeks in a Balloon) the character of Joe, the manservant, is described as enjoying, \"in common with Moestlin, Kepler's professor, the rare faculty of distinguishing the satellites of Jupiter with the naked eye, and of counting fourteen of the stars in the group of Pleiades, the remotest of them being only of the ninth magnitude.\"/nMichael Maestlin has more than one piece of art that is in memoriam to him. The first is a woodcut portrait that was solely made for Maestlin. The second one is part of a monument that was made for Johannes Kepler in Weil-der-Stadt, which was Kepler's hometown. Kepler's monument has four statues of those who deeply influenced his work in astronomy, and needless to say, one of them is of Michael Maestlin. The third art work of Maestlin is a plaque, which is also on Kepler's monument, that shows Maestlin teaching Kepler and his other students.[33]", "71109440": "Ulisse Stefanelli is an Italian mathematician.
