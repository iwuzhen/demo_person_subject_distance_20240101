In contexts of maltreatment, deviant peer affiliations, and other environment risk factors, boys with ADHD are more likely to develop conduct problems, substance use disorders, and antisocial traits,[10] whereas girls with ADHD are more likely to engage in self-injurious behavior (e.g., cutting) and develop borderline traits.[11][12] In protective environments, these outcomes are far less likely.
