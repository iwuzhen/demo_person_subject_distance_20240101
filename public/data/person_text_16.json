He served as surgeon and naturalist on the ill-fated Franklin expedition. His body was never found, but forensic studies in 2009 on skeletal remains earlier recovered from King William Island in Canada suggest that they may be those of Harry Goodsir./nHarry Goodsir was born on 3 November 1819 in Anstruther, Fife, the son of Dr. John Goodsir, a medical practitioner. His paternal grandfather, also Dr. John Goodsir had been a medical practitioner in the nearby town of Lower Largo. \nThree of Harry's brothers became medical practitioners. John Goodsir, his elder brother, would become Professor of Anatomy at Edinburgh University and a pioneer of the doctrine that cells formed the basis of living organisms. His younger brother Robert Anstruther Goodsir qualified as a medical doctor from the University of St Andrews, and Archibald studied in Edinburgh and Leipzig and qualified with membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.[1]/nHe studied medicine in Edinburgh and became a member of the Royal Medical Society. Having qualified as Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1840, he succeeded his brother John as Conservator of the Surgeons' Hall Museum in August\u00a01843.[2] He held this post until March\u00a01845, when he left to join the Franklin expedition, and he was succeeded as conservator by his brother Archibald.[2]/nIn 1845, he co-authored, with his brother John, Anatomical and Pathological Observations. This contained John's unpublished 1841\u20131842 lectures to which his brother had \"added some of his own zoological, anatomical, and pathological observations.\"[3] The three chapters supplied by Harry were seen by his brother as providing important confirmatory evidence to his cellular theory.[4] It was this book that was to win John Goodsir international acclaim and led to the German pathologist Rudolph Virchow dedicating his epoch-making volume to him./nRear Admiral Sir John Franklin, who had previously served on three expeditions to the Arctic, set off in what would prove Franklin's final expedition in 1845, commanding HMS\u00a0Erebus and HMS\u00a0Terror. There were four medical officers: surgeon Stephen Stanley and assistant surgeon Harry Goodsir on HMS Erebus, and surgeon John Peddie  and assistant surgeon Alexander McDonald on HMS Terror.[5]/nGoodsir's final communication was a paper entitled \"On the anatomy of Forbesia\", which was \"...\u00a0transmitted by the author from Disko Island in Greenland in June\u00a01845.[6]\" This was published five years later, and is a comprehensive description of the insect species with 18 detailed illustrations.[6] He is described as \"Acting assistant surgeon on HMS Erebus\". The expedition was last seen by Europeans one month later in July\u00a01845.[7]/nGoodsir's younger brother Robert joined two of the expeditions which attempted to find the Franklin expedition. In 1849, he joined the whaler Advice under the command of Scotsman William Penny, in what was the first of many unsuccessful attempts to find Franklin and his men.[8] Robert Goodsir wrote an account of this voyage: An Arctic voyage to Baffin's Bay and Lancaster Sound: in search of friends with Sir John Franklin. He joined Penny again in 1850 as surgeon on the Admiralty-backed Franklin search expedition with the ships Lady Franklin and Sophia.[8][9]/nRobert Goodsir graduated as a medical doctor from St. Andrews University in 1852, but rarely practiced medicine, travelling to New Zealand as a gold prospector and to Australia as a sheep farmer, before returning to Edinburgh where he died in 1895. He is buried there in Dean Cemetery.[10]/nBetween 1849 and 1959, skeletal remains representing at least 30\u00a0individuals were discovered on King William Island, and most were buried locally.[7] In 1869, American explorer Charles Francis Hall was taken by local Inuit to a shallow grave on King William Island containing well-preserved skeletal remains and fragments of clothing.[11] These remains were repatriated and interred beneath the Franklin Memorial at Greenwich Old Royal Naval College, London. The remains were thought to be those of an officer due to the remnants of a silk vest in which the body had been clothed and a gold tooth filling.[12] After examination of the remains by the eminent biologist Thomas Henry Huxley,[13] the Admiralty concluded that the remains were those of Henry Le Vesconte, a lieutenant on HMS Erebus.[12]/nA subsequent examination in 2009 of the \"well-preserved and fairly complete skeleton of a young adult male of European ancestry\"[14] included a facial reconstruction that showed \"excellence of fit\" with the face of Harry Goodsir, as portrayed in his 1845 daguerreotype.[14] Strontium and oxygen isotope data from tooth enamel were consistent with an upbringing in eastern Scotland, but not with Lt. Le Vesconte's upbringing in southwest England.[14]  A further clue suggesting these might be Goodsir's remains was a gold filling in a premolar tooth, unusual at that time. Goodsir's family were friendly with Robert Nasmyth, an Edinburgh dentist with an international reputation for such work.[15] Harry's brother John had served as dental apprentice to Nasmyth.[16] Analysis of the bones suggest that death was caused by an infected tooth.[17]/nHarry Goodsir appears as a character in the 2007 novel The Terror by Dan Simmons, a fictionalized account of Franklin's lost expedition, as well as the 2018 television adaptation, where he is portrayed by Paul Ready.", "52518686": "Beth N.

His PhD research led directly to the discovery of streptomycin./nBorn to a family of farmers, Schatz was inspired to study soil science for its potential applicability to take up his family occupation. Topping his class at Rutgers in 1942, he immediately worked under Selman Waksman, then head of the Department of Soil Microbiology, but was drafted to the US Army to serve in the World War II. After a back injury led to his discharge from the army, he rejoined Waksman in 1943 as a PhD student. Working in isolation from others due to his use of the dreaded tuberculosis bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), he discovered a new antibiotic which he named \"streptomycin\" that was proven safe and effective against the tuberculosis bacterium and other bacteria. He also contributed to the discovery another antibiotic albomycin in 1947./nThe discovery of streptomycin led to controversies over its royalties from commercial production, and the Nobel Prize. Unbeknownst to Schatz, Waksman had claimed financial benefits only for himself and the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation. A lawsuit granted Schatz 3% of the royalties and legal recognition as the co-discover. Then, the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded solely to Waksman explicitly \"for his discovery of streptomycin,\"[3] which The Lancet remarked as \"a considerable mistake by failing to recognize Schatz's contribution.\"[4] As an act of goodwill, Schatz was honored with the Rutgers University Medal in 1994./nSchatz was born in Norwich, Connecticut, US, and attended schools at Passaic, New Jersey. His parents, Russian Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 father Julius Schatz and English mother Rae Schatz were farmers. He entered the College of Agriculture at Rutgers State University of New Jersey in 1932. He completed the Bachelor of Science with honours in soil science in 1942, topping his class.[5] The day he received his result in May,[6] he joined Selman Waksman who headed the Department of Soil Microbiology at Rutgers, as a postgraduate assistant. Waksman had been directing a research program searching for new antibiotic compounds produced by microorganisms in ordinary soil since 1937, and his teams were to discover more than 10 such chemicals between 1940 and 1952. A fellow student, Doris Ralston, described Schatz as \"A poverty-stricken, brilliant student who worked with a burning intensity.\"[5]/nSchatz initially worked on the antibiotics, actinomycin, clavacin and streptothricin, which Waksman had developed. He soon found out that these compounds were too toxic in animals to be of any practical usage in humans.[6] After working for five months he was conscripted to the US Army in December 1942 during World War II. As a man with microbiology background, he was posted as a bacteriologist in the Medical Detachment of the Air Force, stationed in army hospitals in Florida.[7] He was discharged on 15 June 1943 due to back injury.[5]/nWith an option to work in a pharmaceutic company or pursue a PhD, Schatz chose the latter. He rejoined Waksman's lab from where he received a PhD in 1945 with the thesis \"Streptomycin, an Antibiotic Produced by Actinomyces griseus.\"[6] His PhD work led to the discovery of the first antibiotic, streptomycin, that is effective against tuberculosis.[8]/nAfter leaving Rutgers in 1946, Schatz worked at Brooklyn College, and the National Agricultural College in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Much of Schatz later work was on dentistry starting from 1953. While working as the Chief of the Division of Microbiology at the Philadelphia General Hospital, Schatz and his uncle Joseph J. Martin at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Medicine developed a theory on the cause of tooth decay. The theory which they named \"proteolysis-chelation theory\" rooted in Schatz's original research in 1955.[7] The full framework of the theory was published in 1962.[9]/nSchatz became the Most Distinguished Professor of the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy at the University of Chile from 1962 to 1965,[10] then professor of education at Washington University in St. Louis from 1965 to 1969, and professor of science education at Temple University from 1969 to 1980.[2][11][12] At Chile, he continued to study the effects of fluoridation of drinking water.[7]/nOn his return to Waksman's lab in 1943, Schatz offered to take on the search for an antibiotic effective against Gram-negative bacteria responsible for other penicillin-resistant diseases. There was no antibiotic then usable for the treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria \u2013 the only effective compound, streptothricin, although having low toxicity to leukocytes, was considered too toxic and too weak for clinical application.[13][14] At that time, William Hugh Feldman at the Mayo Clinic had suggested Waksman to look for antibiotics that would fight tuberculosis. But Waksman had no intention as he was afraid to handle a bacterium as deadly as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative pathogen of tuberculosis. When Schatz learned of this, he insisted that he take up a research on a tuberculosis drug, to which Waksman agreed. Feldman gave him H-37, the most virulent tuberculosis bacterial strain in humans that was available.[6]/nWaksman made sure that Schatz worked alone and remained isolated in the basement of the laboratory, and ordered Schatz that the bacterial samples should never leave the basement. Within three and a half months, Schatz had identified two related strains of bacteria (Streptomyces griseus) that belong to the group (order) Actinomycetes whose secretions stopped the growth of tuberculosis bacterium and several Gram-negative bacteria.[5] One strain came from a throat swab of a healthy chicken, the other from a heavily manured field soil. He recollected his research saying:/nDuring that time, I slept on a wooden bench in the laboratory. I drew a horizontal line with a red glassmarking pencil on the flasks from which I was distilling. If I was asleep when the liquid boiled down to the red mark, the night watchman woke me up and I added more liquid. This was during World War II when rationing was in effect. I therefore recycled organic solvents that I used in sufficiently large volumes to justify recycling. I worked day and night to produce that streptomycin because I wanted Feldman to do toxicity and in vivo tests as soon as possible, and because Waksman did not assign anyone to help me.[6]/nIn the afternoon of 19 October, Schatz noticed that the tuberculosis bacteria were killed by his actinomycete extract, which he gave the name \"streptomycin\"[6] following the scientific name of the source and the earlier antibiotic streptothricin discovered by Waksman and H. Boyd Woodruff in 1942.[15] The bacteria from chicken used in the experiment was provided by another researcher Doris Jones, and Elizabeth Bugie performed the antibacterial tests.[16] Schatz, Bugie and Waksman reported the discovery in the journal Experimental Biology and Medicine which published it on 1 January 1944.[17] The new compound was effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as the human strain of tuberculosis bacterium,[18][14] which is neither a Gram-negative or Gram-positivie species.[19] Their conclusion states:/nStreptomycin, like streptothricin, possesses strong bactericidal properties, and preliminary experiments tended to indicate that the two substances are also comparable in their low toxicity to animals and in their in vivo activity. The various chemical and biological properties of streptomycin tend to point to this compound as one closely related to streptothricin; the fact that it differs from the latter in the nature of its antibacterial activity may indicate a closely related but not the same type of molecule.[17]/nWith his lab mates, Schatz announced on 4 August 1944 the effectiveness of streptomycin in vivo in experimental tuberculosis in mice.[20] He and Waksman reported the effectiveness of streptomycin against different strains of tuberculosis bacterium and other related pathogens on 1 November 1944,[21] and published a series of papers on the production of streptomycin and related antibiotics the next year.[22][23][24] In 1946, they identified that only specific species of actinomycetes produce streptomycin.[25]/nFeldman and his team conducted the first clinical trial and toxicity tests at the Mayo Clinic in late 1944 and reported it in 1945.[26] The first individual treated was a 21-year-old girl who had advanced pulmonary tuberculosis and was given streptomycin on 20 November 1944.[27] By 1946, experiments conducted under the projects of Merck in the UK and USA had proven streptomycin's effectiveness against TB, bubonic plague, cholera, typhoid fever, and other penicillin-resistant diseases.[28][29][30] All the original samples in clinical trials were prepared by Schatz alone.[31]/nWaksman knew that patenting streptomycin could be difficult because US patent law prohibited natural products and Schatz method had no particular novelty.[32] With the help of the Merck lawyers who had aided him patenting actinomycin and streptothricin, he argued that the new  compound was chemically distinct from the natural compound in the bacteria. This convinced the patenting authority.[31][33]/nIn the patent agreement on 1 May 1946, both Schatz and Waksman agreed to receive a token $1.00 as recognition for being the inventors of the streptomycin production method, so that the beneficiary would be Rutgers and not individuals.[6] Schatz agreed to make streptomycin available as readily and inexpensively as possible, and he understood that the foundation also was to receive no profit from the discovery. At Waksman's request, Schatz signed over his right to royalties from the US streptomycin patent to the Rutgers Research and Endowment Foundation, and later signed over his foreign rights.[5] The US Patent Office granted U.S. Patent 2,449,866 titled \"Improvement in Streptomycin and Processes of Preparation\" to Schatz and Waksman on 21 September 1948.[6] Merck was to get an exclusive right for commercial production.[32] Schatz was the lead author of the paper on streptomycin discovery with Bugie as the second. Bugie was excluded from the patent due to Waksman's impression that she would \"just get married.\"[16] Years later Bugie told her daughters, \"If women's lib had been around, my name would have been on the patent.\"[34]/nSchatz began to feel that Waksman was playing down his (Schatz's) role in the discovery and taking all the credit. In 1949, it became publicised that Waksman, contrary to his public pronouncements, had a private agreement with the foundation giving him 20% of the royalties\u00a0\u2013 which by then had amounted to $350,000 ($4,304,800 adjusted for inflation)\u00a0\u2013 and the Rutgers foundation 80%. In March 1950, Schatz, filed a lawsuit against Waksman and the foundation for a share of the royalties and recognition of his role in the discovery of streptomycin.[5] Bugie supported Schatz on the discovery, but did not participate in the royalty matter.[18] Waksman denied receiving any financial benefits. After the court trial on 29 December 1950, the Superior Court of New Jersey issued the verdict in favor of Schatz, concluding that \"[Schatz] is entitled to credit legally and scientifically as co-discoverer, with Dr. Selman A. Waksman, of streptomycin.\"[6]/nAn out-of-court settlement awarded Schatz $120,000 for the foreign patent rights, and 3% of the royalties, representing about $15,000 per annum for several years.[35] Waksman got 10% and 7% was evenly distributed to all workers in Waksman's lab. With its 80% share, the Rutgers established the Waksman Institute of Microbiology.[18] Schatz was never again able to find work in a top-level microbiology lab.[5]/nIn October 1952, Waksman was announced as the sole winner of the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis.\"[3] The Nobel committee statement given by presenter Arvid Wallgren at the award ceremony in Stockholm on 12 December 1952 was \"Selman Waksman, the Caroline Medical Institute has awarded you this year's Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for your ingenious, systematic and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin\"[31] rather than \"for the discovery of streptomycin\" as the original announcement said.[5] But the official citation was specific \"for his discovery\".[3]\nIn his accounts on streptomycin discovery, Waksman never mentioned Schatz. When Feldman performed the first clinical trial of streptomycin, he did not know that the new drug had been discovered by Schatz, and it was much later in Chile (the 1960's) where he met Schatz that the story was brought up in their conversation.[6]/nIn the 1980's Milton Wainwright from Sheffield University interviewed Rutgers faculty members for his 1990 book on antibiotics, Miracle Cure, asking questions about Schatz, it piqued the curiosity of some professors, who made their own inquiries and spoke with Schatz. A group of professors, including Karl Maramorosch and Douglas Eveleigh, began to lobby for Schatz's rehabilitation, because they were convinced that Schatz had been the victim of an injustice. This culminated in Rutgers awarding him the 1994 Rutgers University Medal, the university's highest honor.[5]/nIn 2005,The Lancet commented: \"The Nobel committee made a considerable mistake by failing to recognise Schatz's contribution.\"[4]/nThe discovery of streptomycin was followed by that of grisein. Donald M. Reynolds, Schatz and Waksman reported the discovery in 1947.[36] The new antibiotic was isolated from the same bacteria that produced streptomycin. It was not as powerful as streptomycin or streptothricin, but was less toxic and effective against most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.[37] When other related compounds were discovered from other bacteria, grisein was considered as member of a more specific compound, albomycin.[38] These compounds were later commonly referred to as \"Trojan horse\" antibiotics for their ability to act as their molecular targets inside the cells.[39][40]/nSince 1945, the US has advocated water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay.[41] Supported by his uncle Martin, Schatz investigated the cause of tooth decay from the mid-1950s.[42] When he began he was surprised to learn that the cause of tooth decay was tacitly assumed to be acidity in the mouth, without any experimental evidence.[7] The acid theory, as it was known, stated that hydrogen ions (which determine pH) are the critical factor for dental health. But his experiments showed that tooth decay occurs regardless of acidity or alkalinity.[42] in 1962, he and his uncle offered a new explanation for tooth decay, the \"proteolysis-chelation theory.\"[9] (He later referred to his original 1954 theory as the \"chelation theory.\"[10]) The theory emphasized biochemical reactions over acid demineralization. According to the theory, caries develop as bacteria invade the teeth cavities in the presence of organic compounds (chelating agents) such as sugars, lipids and citrates to break down (proteolyze) the tooth protein (keratin); the process is independent of the pH of the environment.[7]/nHis findings also led him to oppose the fluoridation of drinking water based on his understanding of the biochemical impact of fluoride on tissue.[11] He challenged the fluoridation of drinking water by public health programs. Reporting in 1967 the \"Increased death rate in Chile associated with artificial fluoridation of drinking water, with implications for other Latin American countries and for the United States,\"[43][44] he further claimed that in Chile, water fluoridation not only failed to prevent tooth decay, but instead caused increased cancer that led to increased death among people with malnutrition.[45] He also criticized a scientific paper published in 1966 that presented the advantages of water fluoridation in the Curico province of Chile,[46] arguing that the data was incomplete. In 1978, the US Department of Health Center for Disease Control in Atlanta issued a public statement that Schatz's data was improperly analyzed and did not present the true relationship between water fluoridation and cancer and mortality with the conclusion: \"Water fluoridation for the purpose of dental caries prophylaxis poses no hazard relevant to cancer causation.\"[7] In 1992, he was severely criticized in The New Zealand Medical Journal for bias and publication in an obscure journal.[47] He responded by claiming that the publication was in a legitimate journal,[7] and that the critics had overlooked a separate publication in The Journal of Nihon University School of Dentistry.[48]/nAs of 2021, the benefits or dangers of fluoridated water are still not resolved,[41] with recent evidence on its harmful neurological effects.[49]/nSchatz's initial interest in soil microbiology stemmed from his intention to become a farmer following his parents. Seeing workers being assaulted by the authorities during the Depression prompted him to lifelong socialism and humanitarianism. He married Vivian Rosenfeld, a student at New Jersey College for Women, in March 1945 and they had two daughters, Linda and Diane.[5][11]/nSchatz received honorary degrees from Brazil, Peru, Chile, and the Dominican Republic. On the 50th anniversary of the discovery of streptomycin, in 1994, he was awarded the Rutgers University Medal. The New York Times placed Schatz and Waksman's 1948 streptomycin patent in the top 10 discoveries of the 20th century. The university has made Schatz's basement lab into a museum documenting his and other antibiotic discoveries made at the college.[12]/nAs a result of the streptomycin controversy, regulations were passed in the US aimed at ensuring graduate students get due recognition and reward for their contributions.[11] Albert Schatz's archives were donated to the Temple University Library.", "51044193": "Debora S.

In an interview with Adam Spencer, Nossal noted that his father was not a professing Jew but of Jewish ethnicity as he had been baptised a Roman Catholic as a child. Nossal remarked that his father \"therefore thought that he would be somewhat protected from the Holocaust-type predicament. Of course, he hadn't properly read Mein Kampf. It was all spelt out there: if your four grandparents were Jewish, then you were Jewish.\"[1] He was baptised and remains a practising Roman Catholic.[2]/nNossal showed interest in medicine and wanted to become a doctor since the age of seven.[3] When he first attended school in Australia, Nossal spoke no English[4]\nbut he graduated from St Aloysius' College in 1947[5]\nas the dux of the college.[6] In 1948, he entered the Sydney Medical School, graduating later with first-class honours from the University of Sydney. At the age of 26, he left his job in Sydney and moved to Melbourne to work with Macfarlane Burnet in medical science at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and gained his PhD degree at the University of Melbourne in 1960./nOn describing his views on religion Nossal said:/nFor me, a large part of that is a tremendously strong identification with the mission of the Church. An instinct for justice is central to that mission and central to being a Catholic...\nScience deals with fundamentally repeatable, objective, verifiable observations. It deals with hypotheses of which you can at least say \"this is not patently false.\" But the human experience, on the other hand, does not just deal with verifiable facts. The human experience has Shakespeare. It has Beethoven. It has Thomas Aquinas. There is no scientist alive who can tell me how the brain of Shakespeare differs from the brain of the worst scribbler for the tabloid press. This is not yet and may never be in the realm of science... We have to access this huge other area of human experience through other means. Call them the humanities. Theology, of course, is one of the great humanities. A human being struggling to understand the cosmos and to understand his or her own consciousness is not at all antipathetic or opposed to me struggling to understand how cells make antibody molecules./nFollowing the retirement of Macfarlane Burnet in 1965, at the age of 35 Nossal became director of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, a position that he kept until 1996.  In parallel, he was Professor of Medical Biology at the University of Melbourne. Nossal's research was in fundamental immunology, in the field of \"antibody formation and immunological tolerance\".[7] He has written five books and 530 scientific articles in this and related fields./nNossal has been President (1970-1973) of the 30,000-member world body of immunology, the International Union of Immunological Societies; President of the Australian Academy of Science (1994-1998); a member of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) (1989 to 1998); and Chairman of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (1987-1996). He has been chairman of the committee overseeing the World Health Organization's Vaccines and Biologicals Program (1993-2002) and Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Council of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Children's Vaccine Program (1998-2003). He was Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1998 to 2000.

KAT2A gains a new function and acts as a histone H3 succinyltransferase to regulate gene expression by locally catalyzing succinyl-CoA generated by \u03b1-KGDH.[20] He also demonstrated that generation of acetyl-CoA at the gene promoter regions by nuclear acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) induces gene expression for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy[21]", "5660535": "Flossie Wong-Staal (n\u00e9e Wong Yee Ching, Chinese: \u9ec4\u4ee5\u9759; pinyin: Hu\u00e1ng Y\u01d0j\u00ecng; August 27, 1946\u00a0\u2013 July 8, 2020) was a Chinese-American virologist and molecular biologist. She was the first scientist to clone HIV and determine the function of its genes, which was a major step in proving that HIV is the cause of AIDS. From 1990 to 2002, she held the Florence Riford Chair in AIDS Research at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). She was co-founder and, after retiring from UCSD, she became the chief scientific officer of Immusol, which was renamed iTherX Pharmaceuticals in 2007 when it transitioned to a drug development company focused on hepatitis C and continued as chief scientific officer.[3]/nWong-Staal was born as Wong Yee Ching in Guangzhou, China, in 1946. The third child in her family of four, she grew up with two brothers and a sister. In 1952, her family was among the many Chinese citizens who fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution in the late 1940s. During her time in Hong Kong, Wong attended Maryknoll Convent School, where she excelled in science.[4] Although no women in her family had ever worked outside the home or studied science, her parents supported her academic pursuits. Throughout her time at the school she was encouraged by many of her teachers to further her studies in the United States. Her teachers also suggested she change her name to something in English. Her father chose the name \"Flossie\" for her after a massive typhoon that had struck Southeast Asia around this time.[4][2]/nWhen she was 18, she left Hong Kong to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, where she pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in bacteriology.[5] She was graduated cum laude in just three years. After earning her bachelor's degree, she went on to earn a Ph.D. in molecular biology from UCLA in 1972. She conducted her postdoctoral work at the University of California, San Diego, where she continued to research.[4]/nHer postdoctoral work continued until 1973, when she moved to Bethesda, Maryland, to work for Robert Gallo at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). At the institute, Wong-Staal began her research into retroviruses.[6] Two years later, Wong-Staal became the first researcher to clone HIV. She also completed genetic mapping of the virus which made it possible to develop HIV tests.[7] This led to the first genetic map of the virus, which aided in the development of blood tests for HIV.[8]/nIn the late 1970s, Wong-Staal's team, alongside Dr. Gallo, conducted research on the human retrovirus, human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), and determined that it was the causative agent in human adult T cell leukemia. Her team specifically studied the molecular virology of HTLV-1 by examining its transcriptional activators and posttranslational regulators. This discovery was significant in the study of human retroviruses as there was prior debate as to whether retroviruses could cause human disease.[5]/nIn 1990, Wong-Staal was recruited from NCI to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where she started the Center for AIDS Research. Wong-Staal continued her research into HIV/AIDS at UCSD. Wong-Staal's research focused on gene therapy, using a ribozyme \"molecular knife\" to repress HIV in stem cells. The protocol she developed was the second to be funded by the United States government. In 1990 a team of researchers led by Wong-Staal studied the effects that the Tat protein within the viral strain HIV-1 would have on the growth of cells found within Kaposi's sarcoma lesions commonly found in AIDS patients.[9]/nThe team of researchers performed tests on a variety of cells that carried the Tat protein and observed the rate of cell proliferation in cells infected by HIV-1 and the control, a culture of healthy human endothelial cells.[10] Wong-Staal used a type of cellular analysis known as radioimmunoprecipitation in order to detect the presence of KS lesions in cells with varying amounts of the Tat protein. The results of these tests showed that the amount of Tat protein within a cell infected by HIV-1 is directly correlated to the amount of KS lesions a patient may have. These findings were essential in developing new treatments for HIV/AIDS patients who suffer from these dangerous lesions.[11]/nIn 1994, Wong-Staal was named as chairman of UCSD's newly created Center for AIDS Research.[8] In that same year, Wong-Staal was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academies,[12][13] and to Taiwan's Academia Sinica.[14]/nIn 2002, Wong-Staal retired from UCSD and accepted the title of professor emerita. She then joined Immusol, a biopharmaceutical company that she co-founded with her second husband, Jeffrey McKelvy,[15] while she was at UCSD, as chief scientific officer. Recognizing the need for improved drugs for hepatitis C (HCV), she transitioned Immusol to an HCV therapeutics focus and renamed it iTherX Pharmaceuticals.[16]/nThat same year, Discover named Wong-Staal one of the fifty \"most extraordinary women scientists\".[3] Wong-Staal remained as a research professor of medicine at UCSD until her death on July 8, 2020.[2][17]/nIn 2007, The Daily Telegraph heralded Wong-Staal as #32 of the \"Top 100 Living Geniuses\".[18]/nFor her contributions to science, the Institute for Scientific Information named Wong-Staal \"the top woman scientist of the 1980s\".[2] In 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[19]/nIn 1971, while doing her PhD at the UCLA, she married a fellow student, oncologist Stephen P. Staal. The couple had two daughters (Stephanie and Caroline Vega), before divorcing around 1990. Wong-Staal later re-married to neurologist Jeffrey McKelvy, with whom she founded Immusol.

Also in the year 1970, Mertz joined Paul Berg's lab which was located in the biochemistry department at Stanford.[13] Berg said that Mertz was \"as smart as all hell.\"[13] While taking a course held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in summer 1971, she mentioned her plan to grow mutants of the oncovirus, SV40, by molecular cloning of them in the human gut bacterium, E. coli.  This event led, initially, to a voluntary moratorium on cloning of viral oncogenes and, later on, the cloning of any DNA that might contain potentially biohazardous materials until theoretical safety concerns could be addressed and guidelines for their safe use could be developed and implemented./nIn the interim, in collaboration with Ronald W. Davis, Mertz discovered that DNA ends generated by cutting with the EcoRI restriction enzyme are \"sticky\", permitting any two such DNAs to be readily \"recombined\". Using this discovery, in June 1972 she created the first recombinant DNA that could have been cloned in bacteria.[14][15][16] Her success with this project contributed to her thesis adviser, Paul Berg, receiving the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[17]  However, Mertz did not proceed with this cloning because of the moratorium in place at that time, leaving it for Herbert Boyer, Stanley N. Cohen and their colleagues to prove in 1973 that recombinant DNAs made by this method can actually self-replicate in bacteria.[18]  Thus, most of Mertz's Ph.D. thesis centered, instead, around developing other ways to create, select, and grow mutants of SV40 for studying this virus' functions and so it could be used as the first eukaryotic cloning vector.[19] The US Patent 4,237,224, \"Process for Producing Biologically Functional Molecular Chimeras\", which generated over $250 million in licensing and royalty income, listed only Boyer and Cohen as co-inventors.[12][20] Some have questioned whether these patents were valid given the earlier publications by Peter Lobban and A.

D. degrees in bacteriology and biochemistry from Penn State University. In 1960-62, Dobrogosz held an NIH-supported postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and afterwards began teaching at N.C. State University. He became a full Professor of Microbiology at N. C. State in 1968 and remained there until his retirement in 2003. While at N. C. State, he taught the graduate courses 'Metabolic Regulatory Mechanisms,' 'Microbial Physiology and Bioenergetics,' and 'Metabolism, Growth, and Regulation,' and the undergraduate courses \"General Microbiology,' 'Microbial Metabolism,' and 'Microbes and World Affairs.'/nEarly in his research career, Dobrogosz studied metabolic regulation in such species as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. In particular, his research focused on the phenomenon of catabolite repression, a regulatory system involving interactions of cyclic AMP, the catabolite repressor protein (CRP) complex, and the lac operon and other inducible systems in bacteria./nThe focus of Dobrogosz's research shifted in 1985, when he and student Lars Axelsson identified L. reuteri, a new lactic acid bacterium. Later that year, while on a Fulbright Fellowship to study in Sweden, Dobrogosz and colleague Sven Lindgren discovered that L. reuteri produces a potent anti-microbial substance, which they termed \"reuterin.\" Based on this, they hypothesized that the human-specific strain of L. reuteri had the potential to be a protective probiotic. Dobrogosz and his fellows obtained patents on both the bacterium and reuterin, and later began to market L. reuteri for its benefits to human and animal health./nDobrogosz founded Probiologics International (PBI) in 1987, a company devoted to the commercial prospects of L. reuteri. PBI began to carry out human clinical trials, and found that L. reuteri is effective in preventing diarheal diseases and other gut infections. L. reuteri is now known to maintain intestinal health, prevent fungal, bacterial, and protozoal infections, and mediate the body's immune response. PBI was purchased by public investors in 1990, and later its name was changed to BioGaia AB.

The company was bought by Teledyne Benthos in 2012. Girguis currently serves as a board member of the Ocean Exploration Trust and the Schmidt Marine Technology Partners./nGirguis grew up in Downey, California, which was a hub of the aerospace industry throughout the 1970s. He later attended the University of California Los Angeles, where he worked with Drs. William Hamner and David Chapman. He graduated with a degree in Ecology and Marine Biology. He pursued his doctoral degree at the University of California Santa Barbara, working with Drs. James Childress and Robert Trench. After receiving a Packard Foundation postdoctoral fellowship, he went to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute to work on anaerobic methane oxidation with Dr. Edward Delong. While at MBARI, and with support of Drs. Edward Delong and Marcia McNutt, he began developing underwater mass spectrometers and deep-sea incubators./nAs a graduate student, Girguis worked with Childress to develop high-pressure aquaria that would mimic the pressures and chemical conditions found around hydrothermal vents. He later incorporated a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to measure changes in dissolved gases within the aquaria. He used this system to publish some of the first, robust measurements of metabolite uptake by the deep sea vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila.[4][5] Through his research Girguis found that Riftia tubeworms and their symbionts are capable of fixing carbon dioxide at unprecedented rates, and can keep their tissues from becoming acidic by eliminating hydrogen ions at equally unprecedented rates.[6][7] He was also the first person to keep vent tubeworms alive in the lab for nearly two months.[8]/nAs an MBARI postdoctoral fellow, Girguis and the members of the Delong lab developed an artificial hydrocarbon seep to grow anaerobic methane oxidizing communities. He found that, when methane and sulfate are sufficient, the anaerobic archaea grow at higher rates than previously measured. Later, as an MBARI research associate, he began developing and deploying microbial fuel cells[9] in collaboration with Dr. Clare Reimers from Oregon State University.

He called the substance nadnerczyna (which in Polish literally means \"adrenaline\":  nadnercze is the Polish for \"adrenal gland\").[8]/nIn 1890 Cybulski carried out one of the first-ever EEG recordings of the cerebral cortex.  Working with Adolf Beck (1863\u20131942), he conducted pioneering research on electroencephalographic waves.  Under Cybulski's supervision, Beck made pioneering studies of cerebral-cortex activity in response to peripheral-nerve stimulation in dogs and monkeys, using electrodes placed on the skull to record changes in electric potential. In this way they invalidated William Horsley's notion that these changes reflected the activity of skull muscles.  By further analyses of potential changes, they mapped out sensory regions of the cerebral cortex. They also provided evidence that the amplitude of signals depended on the strength and kind of sensory stimulus and on the depth of anesthesia. They suspected that brain function was mediated by neurons' bioelectrical activity. Their studies on brain mapping and nerve stimulation were absolutely innovative, since they were unfamiliar with earlier research done by Richard Caton on changes in bioelectrical activity of the dog brain during sleep, activity, and changes in behavior.[9]/nAgain working with Beck, Cybulski showed that every taste sensation in the tongue was caused by a separate kind of receptor.

In the book, he took an uncompromisingly Darwinist stance, and applied the principles of natural selection and adaptation to the structures and functions of individual organisms.[3]/nIn 1891 he had already accepted a post as an assistant in the zoological museum of the Friedrich Wilhelm University (now Humboldt University) in Berlin. Initially he occupied himself with preparing anatomical specimens, but from 1893 he also worked in the herpetological department. When its curator, Paul Matschie, took over the mammal collection in 1895, Tornier succeeded him./nIn 1902, he became professor of zoology at the university, whilst later also accepting the post of head librarian at the museum (1903), assistant director of the museum (1921), and finally director ad interim of the museum (1922\u20131923). In addition, he served as a board member of the Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science (Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin) from 1907 to 1924, and as such was closely involved with organizing the Tendaguru Expedition (1910-1912), still the largest dinosaur excavation expedition in history.[4][5]/nTornier retired in October 1923, and died in 1938 in Berlin. He was interred in the Luisenfriedhof-III in Berlin-Charlottenburg./nTornier's research interests focused on amphibians and reptiles, developmental anatomy, and systematics. He became the leading authority on the reptilian and amphibian fauna of German East Africa./nPerhaps unfairly, Tornier's legacy has mainly been determined by his position in the controversy surrounding the posture of the sauropod dinosaur Diplodocus carnegii. Following the 1899 discovery of the animal in Wyoming, it had traditionally been depicted and mounted in an elephant-like stance. However, In 1909, Oliver P. Hay imagined two Diplodocus, being reptiles after all, with splayed lizard-like limbs on the banks of a river. Hay argued that Diplodocus had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely splayed legs.[7] \nTornier had arrived at the same conclusion and forcefully supported Hay's argument, arguing that the tail couldn't physically have made the curve down to the ground. To solve this issue, he lowered the entire animal.[8]/nThe hypothesis, at least as far as the position of the legs was concerned, was contested by W. J. Holland, who maintained that a sprawling Diplodocus would have needed a trench to pull its belly through.[9]/nTornier's acerbic and sometimes sarcastic reply[10] to Holland led to a minor spat, with German authorities (including Kaiser William II himself) coming down on the former's side and even considering re-mounting the Berlin copy of Diplodocus, placed there only a few years before by Holland, in a more \"reptilian\" fashion.[11][12] In the end, however, finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s put Hay and Tornier's theory to rest./nTornier's frog, Litoria tornieri, which is an Australian endemic, was named after him, as was a large sauropod dinosaur found around 1910 in the Tendaguru formations of German East Africa, which was renamedTornieria africanus (Fraas) after the original name Gigantosaurus had been found to be occupied./nAlso, Tornier is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of African reptiles: a snake, Crotaphopeltis tornieri; and a tortoise, Malacochersus tornieri.[13]", "48488491": "F\u00e1tima Ferreira-Briza (born 16 February 1959, Cachoeira de Goias, Brazil) is a Brazilian-Austrian biologist, biochemist and educator.

Once separated they could be recombined with one another. This demonstrated that in the process of sorting out, the different cell types exhibited a cell-specific tendency to arrange themselves in a definite tissue pattern that corresponded to that in normal development. The work was published as Townes' thesis in the classic paper in embryology and developmental biology, 'Directed movements and selective adhesion of embryonic amphibian cells' in 1955 in the J. Exp. Zool. 128:53-120.[9]/nTownes was a member of the faculty at the University of Rochester in the Departments of Anatomy and Pediatrics from 1952 to 1979.  He was named Professor of Pediatrics in 1966 and served as the Chairman of the Division of Genetics and Director of the Genetic Clinic from 1966 to 1979. He served as an honorary research assistant at the University College, London, England between 1965 and 1966.[citation needed]/nIn 1965, Townes described the first patient with isolated trypsinogen deficiency with secondary lack of activation of chymotrypsin and procarboxypeptidase.  The 6-week-old infant was unable to hydrolyze dietary protein due to a singular deficiency of pancreatic trypsinogen. This inborn error of metabolism, resulting in failure to thrive, became known as trypsinogen deficiency disease./nIn 1972, he identified a rare inherited syndrome in a father and four of his six children, characterized by the triad of imperforate anus, dysplastic ears, and thumb malformations, subsequently known as Townes\u2013Brocks syndrome.

However, his tractarian tendencies made him unpopular and he was made rector of St.Philip's at Etobicoke, a remote village across the river from Weston. There, he established a school in 1865 that was to become Trinity College School in Weston, Ontario, where William Osler became a student.[5] Johnson became the major early influence for Osler at this time,[6][7] along with his friend James Bovell.[8] A keen collector of both animal and vegetal specimens, Johnson was schoolmaster and rector of St. Philip's Church, Weston.[9] Johnson died in Toronto in 1880.

Her music was set aside in favour of a commercial career when she was twenty years old and her health soon suffered as a result of long hours spent at unfulfilling work. Knowing of her interest in botany, her family physician introduced her to Jean-Edouard Bommer, a botanist and fern specialist whom she married in 1863.[4][3] One of their children, Charles (1866-1938), would later become a palaeobotanist./nDespite a growing and demanding family, Elisa was drawn further into the world of botany and total described more than 200 fungal species.[3] In 1873 she met Mariette Rousseau who had similar interests and much of their work was produced together.

He is best known for his research on Atlantic salmon[1] and inventing the fast freezing of fish fillets in 1929.[2]/nBorn in Tintern, Ontario, the son of Lution Erotas Huntsman and Elizabeth Gowanlock Huntsman, Huntsman attended St. Catharines Collegiate Institute before receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1905. He then studied medicine receiving his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1907. He would not practice medicine and received an honorary M.D. degree from the University of Toronto in 1933.[3]/nIn 1907, he joined the Department of Zoology of the University of Toronto as a lecturer. In 1917, he was appointed an associate lecturer and was appointed a professor of marine zoology in 1927. He retired in 1954.[3]/nIn 1911, he was appointed Curator at St. Andrews Biological Station in New Brunswick, and became its permanent curator in 1915, following his intensive participation in the Canadian Fisheries Expedition of 1914-15.  For this expedition, the Canadian government hired Johan Hjort, the great Norwegian fisheries biologist who was at that time the leading scientist in the field, to come to Canada and investigate the conditions of the herring in the offshore waters.  Hjort introduced to Canada the latest developments in the nascent science of fisheries biology and in Scandinavian dynamic oceanography, both of which influenced Huntsman profoundly, changing his research focus from the study of ascidian taxonomy and evolutionary questions to problems of fisheries science. Huntsman was Director of the St. Andrews Biological Station from 1919 to 1934, while keeping his post at the University of Toronto.  This enabled him to shape the Canadian fisheries science agenda in that era, promoting the professionalization of the science while at the same time training almost an entire generation of fisheries scientists at the University of Toronto.[4]/nFrom 1924 to 1928 Huntsman was also Director of the Fisheries Experimental Station in Halifax, while continuing his directorship at St. Andrews and his teaching at the University of Toronto. Notably while here, he personally pursued the invention and introduction of fast frozen fish fillets (named Ice Fillets) for the Toronto market, beating Clarence Birdseye in the race to market fast-frozen fish. However, while the introduction was highly successful, the Canadian government curtailed the experiment as the government believed that it was not supposed to compete with private business. In addition, Huntsman invented \"jacketed cold storage\" \u2013 a lasting innovation that saw the coolant coils in freezers encased in sheets of steel to slow down frosting condensation on the inner surfaces of freezers.  This innovation first saw widespread use in cooling cars of railways in the United States and Canada.[4]/nHuntsman also helped in 1921 to found, and was secretary to, the North American Council on Fisheries Research, which began US, Canadian, French, and British (Newfoundland) collaboration on fisheries and oceanographic research in imitation of the European International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.  His work brought him into contact with major figures in marine science of that era, including Henry Bryant Bigelow, who became the first director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and a close friend of Huntsman's; Michael Graham who was later (after WWII) the second director of the Fisheries Laboratory at Lowestoft, England; and William F. Thompson, who was a pioneer of fish population analysis and was director of the International Fisheries Commission (later the International Pacific Halibut Commission) and the pre-eminent American scientist in the field. Huntsman grew to international stature due to his energy and dynamic interest in multiple fields related to marine science, including ecology, oceanography, evolution and various problems in fisheries and marine biology.  Huntsman was a key figure in building an international marine science community.[4]/nHe was president of the Royal Society of Canada from 1937 to 1938. In 1952, he was awarded the Flavelle Medal.

He is known for his major contributions on field of bacteriophage \u03bb research, focused on the interactions between those viruses and their E. coli hosts.[1]/nJean Weigle was born in Geneva, Switzerland,[2] where he obtained his PhD in physics in 1923, from the University of Geneva.\nHe married Ruth Juliette Falk, a widow.[3] \nHe died in Pasadena, California, after suffering a heart attack in 1968.[1]/nAs a physicist he was awarded for his research on x-ray diffraction to the study of crystal structure; the effects of temperature on this diffraction; the diffraction of light by ultrasonics.\nHe was working as professor of Physics at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1920s.\nAt the University of Geneva he became director of the Institute of Physics in 1931. He developed the first electron microscope made in Switzerland, an important factor for the studies of molecular biology leading to creation in 1964 of the Institute of Molecular Biology (MOLBIO) in Geneva by Eduard Kellenberger and others./nAfter suffering his first heart attack in 1946 he emigrated to the US in 1948, resigned from the faculty of the University of Geneva and went to Caltech in Pasadena, California.\nThere he turned to biology and worked in the Phage group of Max Delbr\u00fcck, Seymour Benzer, Elie Wollman, and Gunther Stent. While at Caltech, Weigle worked with other notable molecular biologists, including George Streisinger (whom Weigle mentored as a postdoctoral researcher[4]), Giuseppe Bertani, and Nobel laureate Werner Arber.[5]/nIn 1952, Salvador Luria had discovered the phenomenon of \"restriction modification\" (the modification of phage growing within an infected bacterium, so that upon their release and re-infection of a related bacterium the phage's growth is restricted),[6] (also described in Luria's autobiography,[7] pgs. 45 and 99).  Work by Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani at almost the same time,[8] and later work by others clarified the basis for this phenomenon.  They showed that restriction was actually due to attack by specific bacterial enzymes on the modified phage's DNA.  This work led to the discovery of the class of enzymes now known as \"restriction enzymes.\" These enzymes allowed controlled manipulation of DNA in the laboratory, thus providing the foundation for the development of genetic engineering./nHe is most noted for his demonstration, with Matthew Meselson, of Caltech and Grete Kellenberger of Geneva, that genetic recombination involves actual breakage and reunion of DNA molecules. He created the classic induction of a lysogen, which involved irradiating the infected cells with ultraviolet light. He demonstrated through his classical experiments the inducible nature of the DNA repair system.[9]/nThe induction of \nDNA damage-response genes in bacteria has come to be known as the SOS response. This response includes DNA damage inducible mutagenesis[10] (now referred to as Weigle mutagenesis in his honor) and inducible DNA repair following DNA damage[10] (termed Weigle reactivation).[9]/nIn 1947 he received an honorary doctorate from Case Institute of Technology.

He also lectured extensively on his theories in many parts of the world. His books have been translated into 18 languages and reprinted many times.[1]/nVoisin was born on 7 January 1903 in Dieppe, a coastal community in the Upper Normandy region of France.[2] His parents were Albert Voisin and Marie Antoinette Morthe Legendre, well known farmers and landholders. He undertook his primary and secondary studies in Dieppe at the Jehan Ango school, beginning in 1910, and subsequently at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand in Paris.[3]/nHe undertook his military service with the French navy in 1923, graduating as a lieutenant./nIn 1924 he graduated with a diploma of biochemistry from the School of Physics and Chemistry, \u00e9cole sup\u00e9rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris. Following his graduation from the School of Physics and Chemistry, Voisin worked as an engineer in the rubber industry, initially in a tyre factory. He subsequently took on a senior engineering role in the firm SIT, and developed a method for improving the efficiency of production techniques./nIn 1936 he attended the University of Heidelberg in order to improve his ability with the German language. He received his diploma for a thesis entitled \"Goethe and France\", and was named an Honorary Citizen of the city of Heidelberg.[3]/nVoisin married Martha Rosine Fernagu in occupied Paris during 1943./nAt the outbreak of war in September 1939, Voisin quit his position in the rubber industry to join the war effort. He was initially stationed with the French Navy in Algeria. He was involved in two naval missions in the Mediterranean during 1939, being seriously injured in the second. After initial treatment in Algiers, he spent four months in the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce hospital in Paris.[3]/nIn 1940 he undertook several ground engagements in France, and was also involved in the Narvik Campaign. Prior to the Fall of France, Voisin was ordered to evacuate to England. He and a small contingent of men crossed the English Channel from Cherbourg-en-Cotentin in a daring boat journey lasting several days. Once in England, Voisin met with Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu and was made Secretary Attach\u00e9 to Admiral \u00c9mile Muselier, leader of the Free French Naval Forces.[3]/nIn October 1940, Voisin returned to occupied France to administer his family farm, \"Le Talou\", a 130-hectare (320-acre) estate in Gruchet, south of Arques-la-Bataille. From 1941 to 1944 he assisted the Resistance by secretly arranging deliveries of food produced on the farm. He also acted as a translator for the mayor, Albert Thoumyer, in dealings with the Nazi occupiers. In March 1943, he advocated successfully to save a farmer from the firing squad.[3]/nAfter the liberation of Paris in August 1944, Voisin left Le Talou in the care of his wife and travelled to Paris to meet with Admiral d'Argenlieu. Lieutenant Voisin was assigned a regiment of marine infantry and was then involved in several campaigns with the Free French forces, notably the short-lived but intense Battle of the Vosges in October. He was injured again in Benfeld.[3]/nIn 1946 Voisin published his memoirs of the war, based on his war diaries, under the title A Single Foot on the Earth. It was illustrated by the official Navy artist, Commander Luc-Marie Bayle/nTowards the end of 1945, having fulfilled his duty to his country, Voisin returned to Gruchet to pursue his true passion of farming./nVoisin would derive great pleasure simply from observing his cattle graze the sward. He noticed differences between the action of a grazing cow versus mowing and feeding hay. Whereas a sward mown for hay is all cut at essentially the same time, a grazed pasture is only cut as fast as the herd is able to eat it. Likewise while a feedlot cow may eat as much as she wants without moving, a pastured cow must both walk to a desirable part of the pasture, and then shear the grass with her teeth one mouthful at a time./nOver time he came to the realisation that existing theories of grazing did not accurately describe the conditions of a grazing animal. In an attempt to follow the scientific method, researchers would focus on the growing of grass (without grazing animals), or the feeding of cut grass to animals in feedlots, but very rarely the behaviour of cattle grazing on pasture. Voisin realised that this relationship \u2013 which he called \"the meeting of cow and grass\" \u2013 was fundamentally different to either action performed in isolation./nThese realities led Voisin to the realisation that time is critical. It is not the number of animals per acre, but the time which plants are exposed to animals which is the chief determinant of overgrazing. If animals are permitted to remain on the pasture too long, a palatable plant will be grazed a second time before it has had time to recover from the first. Also, repeated grazing at short intervals does not allow the plant to achieve its maximum growth rate, thus limiting the amount of sunlight energy captured and converted to useful feed by the plant./nThe work Voisin was conducting on his farm began to attract scientific attention. From 1951, Voisin was invited to give lectures both at home and abroad, most notably in the United States in 1951, but also in Great Britain, Ireland and Germany. In 1956, he was appointed an associate professor at the National Veterinary School of Alfort, and a member of the Academy of Agriculture of France.[3]/nIn 1954, Voisin recorded an effective stocking rate for the most productive part of the grazing season (10 May \u2013 23 September) of 2.2 Livestock Units per acre (5.5 LU/ha). Prior to starting rational grazing, Voisin claimed his stocking rate was only 0.6 LU/acre (1.5 LU/ha), representing a more-than tripling of his stocking rate.[4]/nEventually Voisin developed his \"four laws\" of rational grazing; he argued that these principles were applicable universally, \"whatever the soil conditions, climate, altitude, latitude or longitude.\"/nIn June 1964, Fidel Castro extended an invitation to Voisin to deliver a series of lectures at the University of Havana in Cuba on the subject of Rational Grazing. Despite the negative perception in Europe of Castro's communist government, Voisin agreed. He and his wife arrived in Cuba on 3 December, and were personally greeted by Castro at Jose Marti Airport. Castro and Voisin, as well as numerous dignitaries, then led an inspection of a nearby farm owned by the Cuban Prime Minister./nThe series of lectures opened on 8 December at the University of Havana. In welcoming Voisin, Castro stated \"Through all his works, in all his labor, it can be seen that... human health, human happiness, is the main objective of Professor Voisin's work.\" On 11 December, Voisin was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university./nAt 3:50\u00a0pm on 21 December, Voisin died suddenly of a heart attack at his hotel. Fidel Castro announced his death on national television that evening. A state funeral was held the following day at the Great Hall of the University of Havana. Voisin had previously expressed to his wife the desire that, should he die whilst abroad giving lectures, his remains should be buried in the country of his death. In accordance with his wishes, Voisin was buried at Colon Cemetery, Havana.[6]/nVoisin became, and remains, a celebrated figure in Cuba.[7] The Cuban government declared 1965 \"The Year of Agriculture\" in homage to Voisin, and a commemorative stamp was issued on the first anniversary of his death, having a face value of 3\u00a2.[8] Martha Voisin developed a deep fondness for Cuba, and visited many times until her death in 2006 at age 105. She was buried in Havana alongside her husband./nDespite Castro's advocacy of his work and its presence in Cuban academia, Voisin's methods were largely ignored by Cuban farmers until forced to adopt less input-intensive methods following the collapse of the Communist Common Market in 1989, which plunged Cuba into a three-year economic crisis which became known as the Special Period. The loss of Soviet energy and chemical imports necessitated the transition to \"an organic and skill-intensive agroecological model\" based on the principles of Voisinism. The transition was successful; in 1989, Cuban agriculture had been similar to that practiced in California, but by 1992 it was more akin to that practiced in Amish communities. By 1995, the practice of urban agriculture, particularly via the use of organoponicos, was widespread.[6]/nIn the 1980s and later, Voisin's work received increased attention from English-speaking authors, notably Allan Nation, Joel Salatin and Allan Savory.[9] Savory is perhaps the most vocal advocate of Voisin's methods among western authors. Voisin's principles strongly influenced his development of Holistic management). Savory later wrote an introduction for the 1988 reprint of Grass Productivity.[10]/nAlthough Voisin's research is now considered one of the foundational works of the permaculture, holistic management and grass-fed beef movements, he remains relatively unknown in his home country. According to a socialist compatriot G\u00e9rard Pestrinaux, he is a political paradox: \"(Voisin) was not a man of the left, but a classic Gaullist right, and yet he is buried in the cemetery of the heroes of the Cuban Revolution!\"[11]", "64053382": "Bet\u00fcl K\u0131rdar is a Turkish molecular and systems biologist researching design strategies of microorganisms, metabolic engineering, and biological networks.

She has argued that origins of nonreproductive females in social wasps involves mutualism rather than only kin selection or parental manipulation.[10]/nHer work upon social insects has played an  important role in the development of her ideas upon phenotypic plasticity.[11][12] As she notes \"From there I got interested in alternative phenotypes\u2014alternative pathways and decision points during development, and their significance for evolution, especially for higher levels of organization, for speciation, and for macroevolutionary change without speciation.\"[13]/nWest-Eberhard has written from the mid-1980s upon  the role of \"alternative phenotypes,\" such as polymorphisms, polyphenisms, and context sensitive phenotype life history and  physiological traits.[14][15][16] This resulted in her 2003  book Developmental Plasticity and Evolution.[5]/nShe argues that such alternative phenotypes are important since they can lead to novel traits, and then to genetic divergence and so speciation.

He \"graduated in 1933 from Stanford, where he majored in biochemistry\" and then \"went on to earn his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1937.\" After four more years there and at New York University \"he moved to Rockefeller\" where he met his future research teammates.[1]/nMacLeod, over a number of years of research, had resolved several thorny technical issues, so that by the time McCarty arrived at the Rockefeller University, Avery's team had paved the way for McCarty. Their progress over the next three years is described in McCarty's memoir The Transforming Principle, written in the early 1980s.[3]/nMcCarty's arrival at Rockefeller University was also marked by another milestone, namely, the development of a  reagent assay to positively correlate DNA with biological activity. In 1944 they published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine about their work.[4][5][6]/nAcceptance of the concept that \"genes are DNA\" was a slow process.[7][8] Skepticism and being ignored, at least in the New York research institutions abounded. There were challenges associated with research, which made it especially difficult to attract other investigators to pursue it. Few people had the necessary expertise. One needed to use mice for corroboration. However, by 1953, influenced by the enormous impact of Watson and Crick's bihelical structure of DNA, the majority of researchers had fully accepted the 1944 paper./nA 1946 retirement[9] resulted in McCarty being asked to head a specialized 1922-established laboratory. This lab was the scientific home of Rebecca Lancefield, who developed a major classification system. His work, combined with hers, made it clear that  conditions affecting the joints and the heart resulted from infections several weeks earlier. The causal chain of events still eludes us. McCarty attacked this problem by studying both the biology and Rockefeller Hospital patients with acute rheumatic fever./nTogether with his students and collaborators, over the next 20 years, McCarty's work changed the understanding of the organism from a gram-positive streptococcus with a particular serological characteristic to one of the best characterized bacterial species. Work on bacterial cell-wall anatomy and chemistry was just beginning. His work led to the isolation of the streptococcal cell wall as a structural entity suitable for anatomic inspection by electronmicroscopy. Chemical dissection led to characterization of the group A\u2013specific polysaccharide and the peptidoglycan, and the identification of its serological specificity in the terminal hexosamine. In order to prove this specificity, he first had to identify and purify a specific enzyme that cleaved hexosamine (a hexosaminidase) from a soil organism. Treating the polysaccharide with this enzyme abrogated its serological reactivity. McCarty further demonstrated the precise configuration of the hexosamine linkage by synthesizing both \u03b1- and \u03b2-N-acetyl-glucosamine ovalbumin and showing that only the second reacted with group A antisera. A similar analytical strategy indicated that the polysaccharide of group C streptococci differed by having a terminal \u03b2-N-acetyl galactosamine as the serological determinant./nIn parallel, McCarty studied patients with rheumatic fever admitted to the Rockefeller Hospital as well as valuable specimen collections from military outbreaks of the disease during World War II. He and his collaborators found that antibody responses to several streptococcal antigens were significantly higher in the group of individuals that developed acute rheumatic fever than in individuals with uncomplicated infection. However, the response to unrelated antigens, for instance, diphtheria toxoid, was not enhanced. He found that group A streptococci secreted unusually high amounts of DNase, and established a test for the detection of antibodies produced in response to this antigen. This led to the discovery that streptococci were able to produce multiple isozymes of DNase. He purified human C-reactive protein through crystallization, produced a highly specific antiserum, and, using this much simpler and more sensitive test, found that C-reactive protein levels responded more rapidly and reliably than other inflammatory markers and could serve as the most accurate indicator of rheumatic inflammatory activity. Measuring C-reactive protein levels to detect inflammation is routine now in medical practice./nIn his later years, McCarty increasingly served as a statesman of the biomedical sciences. He served for 14 years as the physician-in-chief of the Rockefeller University Hospital, and as a trusted adviser and the vice president of the Rockefeller University. Outside the university, his leadership was sought by the New York City Health Research Council, the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, the Institute of Medicine (as a charter member), and numerous university visiting boards. For more than 40 years, as editor, he placed his stamp of excellence and integrity on the Journal of Experimental Medicine. He was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.[10][11][12]/nMcCarty's scientific interests and energy had a counterpart in his rich personal life. Along with his second[1]  wife, Marjorie, McCarty had a wide circle of very close friends, both in the United States and abroad, who cherished his personal warmth, his low key, spare, and pragmatic character, his wit, and his wide-ranging intellect. He loved English literature, theater, and symphonies. He loved to wander the streets and the museums of the great cities of the world, particularly, Paris, New York, and London, and frequently visited overseas following his retirement.

He examined the role of the hormone ecdysone in the development of the fruit fly. In 1978, Hogness and his group identified the TATA box (Goldberg-Hogness box) as the start sequence for the transcription of genes in eukaryotes. Hogness' work contributed to the discovery that the genetic material of eukaryotes consists of non-coding (introns) and coding (exons) sections and that the expression of numerous genes is regulated by so-called cis-elements.

She was the first woman director of the NIDR's Intramural Research Program. Nylen became director of the NIDR extramural research program in 1984. In 1947 and 1953, she won the women's world singles event at the All England Open Badminton Championship./nNylen is from Denmark. She completed a D.D.S. at the Royal Dental College, University of Copenhagen (Danish language reference) in 1947. Nylen first came to the United States from her native Denmark in the summer of 1949 on a two-month visit to a friend in Washington, DC. During her stay she called on one of her former professors from the Royal Dental College of the University of Copenhagen, who at that time was a visiting scientist here in the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR). He interested her in the possibility of obtaining special training at NIH. As a result, she applied for and received a postdoctoral fellowship in dentistry from NIDR and trained here from 1950 to 1951 in the use of electron microscopy and diffraction in studies of calcified tissues of the mouth. Among her early contributions to this new and unique field of dental research was the perfection of a modified microtome capable of producing high quality ultrathin sections of dental tissues for electron microscope study. Development of this instrument, capable of cutting sections 1/50,000 of a mm. in thickness, permitted the study of hitherto unobserved structures of cells which form enamel and dentin.[1]/nAfter her year at NIH, Nylen returned to Copenhagen where she was an assistant professor in oral diagnosis at her alma mater for two years. In 1955, she came back to Bethesda to join the staff of NIDR's laboratory of histology and pathology.[1] In 1965, Nylen became chief of NIDR's laboratory of biological structure.[2] In July 1977, she became the first woman director of NIDR intramural research. She succeeded acting director Wallace D. Armstrong.[3]/nIn 1984, Nylen became associate director of the NIDR extramural program, succeeding John F. Goggins. Abner L. Notkins replaced Nylen as acting intramural director. In her new position, Nylen administered the institute's extramural program. This component consisted of three categorical branches which fund research in periodontal and soft tissue diseases, craniofacial anomalies, pain control and behavior, and caries and restorative materials.[4]/nShe was an associate editor of the Scandinavian Journal of Dental Research and Oral Sciences Reviews, a member of the advisory editorial boards of Calcified Tissue Research and Acta Odontologica Scandinavica, and a member of the publications committee, Journal of Dental Research. She served for 4 years as a member of the NIH Oral Biology and Medicine Study Section, reviewing NIDR research grant applications, and more recently as a member of the Caries Executive Committee, reviewing contract proposals for the institute's National Caries Program.[3]/nNylen was known for her research on the morphology of tooth enamel and her contributions to refining the electron microscope as an aide in dental research.[5] By 1960, Nylen was recognized for her the production and maturation of the organic matrices of enamel and dentin. Her work in this field led to the publication of an atlas, reporting one of the first embryological studies of dental tissues made at the electron microscope level. Because of its breadth and systematic approach to an understanding of dental histogenesis, this publication has been well received by teachers both in the U.S. and abroad. Other technical advances associated with Nylen's work have included important techniques for the preparation and imbedding of specimens for electron microscopy and specimen preparation for microradiography. She has also contributed to the scientific literature in related areas, including basic studies of the mechanism of mineralization, using other calcifying systems such as tendon, reconstituted collagen, and calculus.[1]/nNylen's dental studies have added to scientific knowledge in areas such as the ultrastructural morphology of teeth and bones, and the calcification of tissue. Her findings of the effects of tetracycline on dental enamel of experimental animals contributed to restrictions on the use of this antibiotic in humans. She is also being cited for her administrative abilities.[5]/nNylen was four times co-winner of the women's doubles championship of Denmark, and in 1947 and 1953, she won the women's world singles event at the All England Open Badminton Championship. She was women's badminton champion of DC in 1950 and 1951 and also won the New England championship in 1951.

Her father held a master of business administration degree from Harvard Business School, and her mother a master's degree in education from Columbia University. Her parents were educators at the college and high school levels, respectively, and her mother later gave up teaching to become a school librarian./nDavison attended an academically challenging junior high school in New Jersey and became especially interested in science. In 1940, aged 15, she was granted a scholarship to study in an advanced placement program at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools where she finished high school and the first two years of college, followed by completion of her degree at the University of Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1944, a Bachelor of Science degree in 1946, and Doctor of Medicine degree in 1948, aged 23. Davison, only 19 years of age, had to wait 9 months in order to attend the university because their quota had already been filled for that semester.[4] During that time only 3 out of 65 students were to be women in each class accepted.[4] She married Donald Adams Rowley, also a physician, the day after graduating from medical school. He then went on to become a distinguished pathologist later in life.[5] In 1951, both Janet and Donald Rowley completed internships at the United States Public Health Service's Marine Hospital in Chicago.[6] Rowley continued her work throughout Chicago and worked in a clinic for children with Down Syndrome.[4] Rowley worked part-time until the youngest of her four sons was 12 years old./nAfter earning her medical license in 1951, Dr. Rowley worked as attending physician at the Infant and Prenatal Clinics in the Department of Public Health, Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1955 she took up a research post at Chicago's Dr. Julian Levinson Foundation, a clinic for children with developmental disabilities, where she remained until 1961. She also taught neurology at the University of Illinois College of Medicine./nIn 1962, Rowley's interest in cancer and chromosomes was sparked as an NIH trainee, studying the pattern DNA replication in normal and abnormal human chromosomes.[4] Dr. Rowley then returned to the University of Chicago, as a research associate in the Department of Hematology. She became an associate professor in 1969 and a full professor in 1977. In the 1970s, she further developed the use of existing methods of quinacrine fluorescence and Giemsa staining to identify chromosomes, and demonstrated that the abnormal Philadelphia chromosome implicated in certain types of leukemia was involved in a translocation with chromosome 9 in some cases. Translocation is the process by which a piece of one chromosome breaks off and joins another chromosome, or when two chromosomes exchange material when both break. She also identified translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 in acute myelogenous leukemia, and between 15 and 17 in promyelocytic leukemia.[7] Rowley also aided in the discovery, through her research, of the formation of retinoid acid, a drug that is able to help return normal function to certain protein receptors.[5]/nThe first chromosomal translocation was discovered by Rowley in 1972 in acute myelogenous leukemia.[8] When Dr. Rowley published her findings in the 1970s, she argued that specific translocations caused specific diseases, going against the established view of the cause of cancer which gave little significance to chromosomal abnormalities.[7] Although there was some resistance to her ideas at first, her work has proven immensely influential, and by 1990 over seventy translocations had been identified across different cancers./nIn 1984, Dr. Rowley was made the Blum-Riese Distinguished Service Professor of medicine, cell biology, molecular and human genetics at the University of Chicago.[6] She also served as the interim deputy dean for science. In 1989, she was not only presented with the Charles S.

Then in 2010, she was awarded the Jesse Stevenson Kovalenko Medal by the National Academy of Sciences.[4] In 2012, Dr. Rowley was selected for the Hope Funds for Cancer Research Award of excellence in the area of Basic Research and was elected to the Hope Funds Scientific Advisory Board. Also in 2012, she won the Japan Prize for Healthcare and Medical Technology with two other scientists for her role in the creation of Gleevec.[4][15] For Rowley's scientific contributions she has received honorary doctor of science degrees from multiple institutions some of which include Yale University and Harvard University.[6] She is also a member of multiple scientific and honorary societies. These distinguished groups include the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.[6] She published more than five hundred articles and continued her research at the University of Chicago until shortly before her death.

She was trained to become a High School Teacher at PUCE, at the time when President John F. Kennedy started the Alliance for Progress Program with Latin America. Some equipment and a few professors were sent to Ecuador to help in the training of high school science teachers. One of her professors, Dr. C\u00e1ndida Acosta, encouraged her to apply for a scholarship to do graduate studies in the United States of America. She received a scholarship from the Latin American Scholarship Program of American Universities (LASPAU)[6] and an international fellowship from the American Association of University Women[7] for her graduate studies in the US. Eugenia obtained a Master of Science from Vassar College and went on to Emory University in Atlanta to obtain a Ph.D with a great mentor, Asa Alan Humphries, Jr. Her dissertation dealt with the role of the egg-jelly on the fertilization of Xenopus laevis. Upon returning to Ecuador in 1972 she became professor of Biology at PUCE, her original University in Quito, and developed her scientific career in Ecuador./nThrough her, Developmental Biology blossomed in a most unlikely place: Not having any funds to buy Xenopus laevis, she came across a frog, called Gastrotheca riobambae, in the very gardens of her University. A frog that she developed into a premier system to study the evolution of developmental adaptations. Gastrotheca is a marsupial frog that carries its eggs in a pouch on her back, where they are pushed in by the male with his hindlimbs. This terrestrial form of reproduction solely occurs in the Latin American frogs of the family Hemiphractidae.[8] Out of the intense competition for reproductive sites in the South American rainforest had evolved over 90 species of these frogs, in which the female incubates her embryos inside her body bringing parallelism to mammalian reproduction.[8]/nMarsupial frog embryos develop under saline conditions typically found in the body in contrast with the aquatic mode of development found in Xenopus and many other frogs.[9] Traditional frogs and marsupial frogs also differ in how their embryos excrete waste. Free-swimming tadpoles excrete ammonia, which would be toxic if accumulated in close quarters. Eugenia del Pino discovered that marsupial frog embryos excrete urea instead of ammonia.[10] She discovered that addition of urea, which reaches high levels in the pouch, allows eggs to develop outside of the marsupial frog mother.[11] Urea is a nitrogenous waste product that marsupial frog embryos use for water retention under the water stress conditions of the maternal pouch./nEggs of these frogs are very large, ranging from 3 to 10\u00a0mm in diameter in different species, and contain the nutrients needed for development up to metamorphosis.[12] She found that Gastrotheca develops much like a chick embryo on the surface of the yolk. However, instead of a primitive streak there is a circular blastopore surrounded by an embryonic disc.[13] Surprisingly, extension starts only after involution at the blastopore is concluded, demonstrating that these important movements can be dissociated from gastrulation itself.[14]  Her analyses revealed extensive modularity in the developmental processes that guide the blastopore closure and notochord elongation in amphibians, features that correlate with reproductive modes and ecological adaptations.[12]/nThe flat embryos of Gastrotheca extend beautiful cranial neural crest cell-streams[15] and branchial arches. Part of the neural crest becomes the \u201cbell gills\u201d that form a rich network of capillaries that surround the embryo in the pouch and exchange gases with the maternal circulation, while still separated by the egg envelope.[16] This is a kind of amphibian version of a placenta without a uterus./nEugenia del Pino studied many other marsupial frogs and found a Venezuelan one called Flectonotus pygmaeus that has adapted to its large egg by having oocytes that at early stages have up to 3000 meiotic nuclei in a single cell. The many nuclei are gradually lost until in the mature yolky oocyte only a single one remains, forming a single germinal vesicle. Eugenia's discovery of the amazing biological adaptations of marsupial frogs lead to a famous Scientific American Article in 1989.[17]/nHer work brought her election to the Latin American Academy of Sciences,[18] The World Academy of Sciences for the Advancement of Science in Developing Countries,[19] and in 2006 she became the first member of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA[2] from Ecuador.

She partnered with scientists from USA, Japan, UK and Germany. She did so informally, or through programs including the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Fulbright fellowships. Her productive scientific career resulted in the training of what is now an active generation of Latin American scientists. Her success results from her dedication and ability to train undergraduates in research. Her publication record is a testimony to her scientific commitment to undergraduate training, as many co-authors were her own undergraduate students.[21] Eugenia del Pino trained over 300 students through both her teaching and research./nEcuador was one of the few countries in Latin America that did not have an Academy of Sciences.

Ingber's early scientific work led to the discovery that tensegrity architecture[16] - first described by the architect Buckminster Fuller and the sculptor Kenneth Snelson - is a fundamental design principle that governs how living systems are structured, from individual molecules and cells to whole tissues, organs and organisms.[17]/nIngber's work on tensegrity led him to propose that mechanical forces play as important a role in biological control as chemicals and genes do,[18] and to investigate the molecular mechanism by which cells convert mechanical signals into changes in intracellular biochemistry and gene expression, a process known as \"mechanotransduction.\"[19] Ingber determined that living cells use tensegrity architecture to stabilize their shape and cytoskeleton, that cellular integrins function as mechanosensors on the cell surface, and that cytoskeletal tension (or \"prestress,\" which is central to the stability of tensegrity structures) is a fundamental regulator of many cellular responses to mechanical cues.[20] Ingber's tensegrity theory also led to the prediction in the early 1980s that changes in extracellular matrix structure and mechanics play a fundamental role in tissue and organ development, and that deregulation of this form of developmental control can promote cancer formation.[21]/nIngber's contributions in translational medicine include discovery of one of the first angiogenesis inhibitor compounds (TNP-470)[22] to enter clinical trials for cancer, creation of tissue engineering scaffolds that led to clinical products, development of a dialysis-like blood cleansing device for treatment of blood stream infections that is moving towards clinical testing,[23][24] creation of a mechanically-activated nanotechnology for targeting clot-busting drugs to sites of vascular occlusion,[25] and co-development of a new surface coating based on Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surfaces (SLIPS) for medical devices and implants that could eliminate the conventional dependency on anticoagulant drugs that pose life-threatening side-effect risks.[26]/nOne of his more recent innovations is the creation of tiny, complex, three-dimensional models of living human organs, known as \"organs-on-chips\" (Organ Chips), which mimic complicated human organ functions in vitro as a way to potentially replace traditional animal-based methods for testing of drugs and toxins.[27] The first human Organ Chip, a human Lung Chip, was reported in Science in 2010.[28] Created using microchip manufacturing methods[citation needed], the Lung Chip is a complex three-dimensional model of a breathing lung that incorporates living human lung alveolar epithelial cells interfaced with endothelial cells within microfluidic channels cast in silicone rubber, which recapitulate structure and function of the tissue-vasculature interface of lung alveolus (air sacs).

In 2012, Ingber's team was awarded a DARPA contract to string together multiple Organ Chips to build an automated human body-on-chips that will recapitulate whole-body physiology.[35] This system could be used in combination with computational modeling to rapidly assess responses to new drug candidates, providing critical information on their safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics.[36]/nOther new technologies from Ingber's lab include development of a fully biodegradable plastic alternative inspired by natural cuticle material found in shrimp shells and insect exoskeletons, known as \u201cShrilk\u201d;[37] a mechanically activated nanotherapeutic that selectively directs clot-busting drugs to sites of vascular occlusion while minimizing unintended bleeding;[38] an siRNA nanoparticle therapy that prevents breast cancer progression;[39] a dialysis-like sepsis device that cleanses blood of all infectious pathogens, fungi and toxins without requiring prior identification;[40] a surface coating for medical materials and devices that prevents clot formation and bacteria accumulation that reduces the need for use of conventional anticoagulant drugs that frequently result in life-threatening side effects,[26] and a computational approach to diagnostics and therapeutics that incorporates both animation and molecular modeling software to virtually develop and test potential drugs designed to fit precisely into their targets\u2019 molecular structures.[41]/nEarlier in his career, Ingber helped to bridge Harvard University, its affiliated hospitals, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) through his involvement in the Center for Integration in Medicine and Innovative Technology, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, and Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center[citation needed].

And the second thing is that we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition.\"[18]/nThe establishment of Whitman College, together with the reconstruction of Butler College, accompanied a significant reconfiguration of Princeton's residential college system, which now incorporates upperclassmen as well as freshmen and sophomores, providing new residential options and increasing opportunities for social interaction across the student body.  In addition, an effort has been made to strengthen the relationship between the university and Princeton's independent eating clubs, where most upperclassmen take their meals, with the goal of enhancing the undergraduate experience of all students. In 2009, she appointed a committee chaired by Nannerl O. Keohane to review undergraduate women's leadership at Princeton.[19][20]/nTilghman has presided over a number of academic initiatives at Princeton, including the creation of a Center for African American Studies,[21]  the Lewis Center for the Arts (named after alumnus Peter B. Lewis),[22] the Princeton Neuroscience Institute[23]  and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment (after alumnus Gerhard R. Andlinger).[24]  Along with the renewal of the Department of Chemistry, these steps have both capitalized on Princeton's existing strengths and broken new ground, ensuring that the university will, in Tilghman's words, continue \"to make the world a better place through the power of the mind and the imagination.\" [25]/nMore broadly, Tilghman's presidency has placed an emphasis on increasing the diversity of Princeton's faculty and students; widening access to the university through improvements to its generous financial aid program and the elimination of admission through \"early decision\"; fostering a multidisciplinary approach to teaching and research; and strengthening the university's international perspective through a wide range of initiatives \u2013 from the Global Scholars Program, which brings international scholars to campus on a recurring basis, to the Bridge Year Program, which gives incoming freshmen an opportunity to defer their studies for a year in order to devote themselves to public service overseas./nAs her presidency started the university accomplished the long-hoped-for goal of eliminating the need for student loans; Princeton became the first American university to replace student loans with grants from its endowment. In principle, students earning a Princeton degree could graduate debt free.[26]/nThe size of the endowment and the success of these programs prompted some to question whether Tilghman would implement a policy of eliminating tuition altogether. In her Wall Street Journal article on this matter, she indicated that Princeton would continue to charge tuition, and that she felt that charging tuition was a morally and economically correct policy to maintain.[27]/nDuring her tenure the percentage of students receiving some form of financial aid increased and the size of the average award also increased. These policies were partially facilitated by the growing size of the university's financial endowment, whose income is used to finance the university's mission alongside tuition, and the annual funding of the operating budget through alumni donations from Princeton's Annual Giving campaign./nAlthough President Tilghman has been accused of favoring women in her hiring practices, in fact, most of her appointees have been men.[28]/nThe women she has hired to senior positions include Amy Gutmann as provost, the second-most-powerful administrative position in the university, Anne-Marie Slaughter as Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs fka Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs as well as her successor Christina Paxson, Maria Klawe as Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Janet Lavin Rapelye as the Dean of Admission.  Gutman would go on to lead the University of Pennsylvania as their president in early 2004; Klawe was chosen president of Harvey Mudd College in 2006. Slaughter took a leave from the university to serve as Director of Policy and Planning at the U.S. State Department, reporting to the Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton. Paxson became president of Brown University in 2012./nTilghman has appointed prominent men to leadership positions at Princeton, such as Charles Kalmbach as the senior vice president for administration, the highest non-academic administrative post, David P. Dobkin as dean of the faculty, Gutmann's replacement as provost and Tilghman's successor Christopher L. Eisgruber, and Klawe's replacement Vincent Poor./nShe initiated a review of undergraduate women's leadership at Princeton, chaired by Nannerl O. Keohane;[29] the review found that the early prominence for women in leadership positions that accompanied to introduction of women students to the campus had recently not been as frequently repeated.[29]/nTilghman signed on to the Ivy League-wide seven-week athletic moratorium, since modified,[30] in which intercollegiate athletes were enjoined from taking part in supervised practices and other obligatory athletic activities for seven weeks during the academic year in order to encourage them to participate in other activities.[31] Supporters of the proposal pointed to studies by former Princeton president William G. Bowen, whose controversial book [32] The Game of Life[33] purported to describe widespread academic \"underperformance\" of college athletes. Detractors claimed that the book was flawed,[32] and the moratorium represented an encroachment on students' freedom to use their time as they saw fit./nDuring her presidency, Tilghman was embroiled in a court case pitting her against the family of a major donor to the university, the Robertsons. The children of the original donors, who were themselves Princeton alums, alleged that the university failed to apply the funds donated by their parents to the intended purpose, and asked for the funds to be restored to the family for use elsewhere. The donated funds had become joined with the university's general endowment, resulting in efficiencies and benefits in fund management and performance, which were not the subject of the Robertsons' complaints. The case was settled in 2008 with a payment to the family of $40 million in legal fees and another $50 million, plus interest, to a new foundation to support education for government service. Princeton retained the remainder of the money for the Wilson school.[34]/nIn August 2012, Tilghman was subpoenaed in her dual capacities as Princeton's president and as a member of Google's board, as part of a suit to block a board approved 2-for-1 Google stock split that the complaining party claimed would represent \"an unfair effort to diminish its voting power while reserving voting rights for the company\u2019s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin\". All members of the Google board received subpoenas. In the case of Tilghman, \"records of donations, contribution pledges or promises made by Tilghman or the university to any charities, organizations, foundations or educational institutions that have any affiliation with Page, Brin, Schmidt or Google\" were demanded.[35]/nWhile Tilghman disquieted some alumni by championing affirmative action policies, establishing a single admission process, and broadening the range of residential and dining options available to students, she also found strong support for these actions and their underpinning vision. Tilghman presided over a major effort to advance the growing community of Princeton Alumnae, culminating in a campus conference entitled \"She Roars\".[36] In her final year, Tilghman led the first major university celebration for \"alternative genders\", resulting in an immensely successful on-campus LGBT alumni gathering; this was the first of its kind on any campus in the United States and set a precedent for the advancement of the LGBT community nationwide.[37]/nAs president of Princeton University, Tilghman was also an ex-officio trustee of the Princeton Board of Trustees, and chairman of Princeton Honorary Degrees Committee.[38]/nTilghman orchestrated an orderly transition from her other Princeton roles after being named president. David Botstein succeeded Tilghman as the Director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics in 2003. Ned S Wingreen succeeded her as the Howard A Prior Professor of Life Sciences. She eventually closed her lab to dedicate her time fully to the presidency; in doing so, she assured that all students who had begun with her as adviser were able to successfully complete their degrees and associated research before the lab closed./nAn award-winning teacher, Tilghman continued to conduct classes even while serving as president./nShe became a \"Princeton Parent\" when her daughter matriculated at Princeton as an undergraduate during her tenure as president and was accorded honorary alumna status to a record number of Princeton classes./nWhile serving as president of Princeton, Tilghman accepted membership on the board of directors of Google, and served in that capacity from October 2005 to February 2018.[39]  As compensation for joining the board, she received 6,000 shares of stock that by 2005 were worth in excess of her Princeton compensation package that by 2003 had reached $533,057.[40]/nBeginning in 2001, she served for a time on the Queen University's Chemistry Innovation Council[41] in order to help the development of the Chemistry program at Queen's, which is based in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.[42]/nTilghman served on the board of trustees at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), Long Island, New York, during the early years of her presidency.[43]/nIn 2006, Tilghman was one of three sitting university presidents who served on the Duke University President's Council that investigated the university's wide-ranging actions after the lacrosse players scandal wherein members of the Duke lacrosse team were charged with various types of inappropriate and allegedly illegal off campus behavior.[44]/nOn September 21, 2012, Shirley informed the Princeton Board of Trustees that she planned to step down as the 19th president of Princeton University at the end of the 2012 academic year.

The water supply included a dam, reservoir and 23-mile pipeline and was completed on May 4, 1904. The only treatment provided to the water supply was the residence time in Boonton Reservoir and the resulting sedimentation processes, which resulted in a significant decrease in the bacterial concentrations in the reservoir influent. City officials were not pleased with the project as delivered by the private water company and filed a lawsuit in the Chancery Court of New Jersey.  Among the many complaints stated by Jersey City officials was the contention that the water served to the city was not \"pure and wholesome\" as required by the contract. After the first trial, Vice Chancellor Frederic W. Stevens ruled that two to three times per year the reservoir did an imperfect job removing bacteria from the water. He ordered the private water company to build sewers in the watershed or provide for \"other plans or devices\" to purify the water.

Magie, and was judged capable of supplying Jersey City with water that was \"pure and wholesome.\"[9][10]/nDespite his opposition to chlorination of the Jersey City water supply, Phelps was a strong proponent of the chlorination of sewage and sewage disposal plant effluents before discharge into a lake or river. Prior to 1909, Phelps conducted numerous experiments on chlorination of sewage and sewage disposal plant effluents. He worked on this research area at the MIT Sanitary Research Laboratory with Charles-Edward A. Winslow and he also conducted investigations while working for the New Jersey Sewerage Commission and the Baltimore Sewerage Commission. He found that chloride of lime was \"\u2026the most efficient germicide that we have now available\".[5]:\u200a6305\u20137\u200a[9]/nDuring the second trial, one of the issues of contention was the mode of action of chloride of lime once it was dissolved in water. John L. Leal claimed that bacteria were killed by nascent oxygen that was released when chlorine was added to water. Phelps noted that he had recently been experimenting with a coal tar derivative called orthotolidine which he said could be used to show that chlorine itself was present in water and he claimed that chlorine was responsible for the disinfection of pathogens.[5]:\u200a6320\u201329\u200a The orthotolidine method for chorine residual was modified many times over the next several decades but Phelps's testimony about it was the first mention of it in any document.[9] The method was used for many years as the standard way of determining chlorine residuals in water. In the 1970s and 1980s it was eventually replaced by the DPD method.[11][12] Orthotolidine is still used in test kits to determine chlorine levels in swimming pools./nOn October 29, 1902, he married Helen May Ellis of Lawrence, Massachusetts.  They had five children and at his death, he had ten grandchildren.[3][13]/nPhelps was active in a long list of professional associations including the American Society of Civil Engineers, American Chemical Society, American Public Health Association, Society of American Bacteriologists, American Association for the Advancement of Science, the New England Water Works Association, Massachusetts Association of Boards of Health and the Boston Society of Civil Engineers.[3]/nIn 1953, Phelps was awarded the prestigious Albert Lasker Public Service Award from the American Public Health Association \u201cin recognition of a lifetime of pioneering leadership in public health and sanitary science.\u201d [14] In 1964, the Florida Section of the Water Environment Federation established the Earle B.

Scott./nHubbard spent the majority of his childhood in Elizabethtown, Kentucky[9] about 85 miles (137\u00a0km) east of Lexington. Hubbard's fascination with space exploration began at around nine years old, when Sputnik first orbited the Earth. His dad then brought home a 2-inch (51\u00a0mm) refracting telescope for the backyard which the two used to study the night skies, with a particular interest in Mars. Hubbard was an avid reader of both science fiction and science books by people such as George Gamow, Isaac Asimov, and Fred Hoyle,[9] as well as books on astronomy and cosmology. Hubbard's interest in life in the universe eventually turned into\u2014many years later\u2014astrobiology./nA few years after the telescope came home, Hubbard's father brought home a baritone ukulele which enthralled him. He learned from the included pamphlet a few basic chords and some simple tunes which he practiced for hours on end. From there he graduated to \u201cTruetone\u201d Spanish guitar but, proving far too frustrating to play, moved to a \u201cSilvertone\u201d quickly. He taught himself to play from books and by listening to the likes of the greats of the early 1960s, such as Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, the Kingston Trio, Bob Dylan, and Peter, Paul and Mary.  From this period in his life onward, space and music began a close race for his attention./nHubbard graduated in 1966 from Elizabethtown High School as valedictorian of his class and as a National Merit finalist, which together brought a considerable number of scholarship offers.

He attended West Christchurch District High School.[1] An uncle, Robert Kerr,[2] had made a fortune in South Africa after the Boer War and had retired to Geneva in Switzerland where he invested money into Dr Henri Spahlinger's work on a vaccine for Tuberculosis.[3] Kerr had wanted Josland to study law and had offered to finance his studies.[4] The offer never came through, however, as Kerr died of malarial fever in Geneva on 7 April 1923, aged 46. Perhaps influenced by his uncle's early death, Josland commenced studying towards a medical degree at the University of Otago in Dunedin. He did not finish the degree, due to financial constraints, but gained a Certificate of Proficiency in Bacteriology and Clinical Pathology from the University in 1926. He married Elsie Naviro Railton in Dunedin on 20 December 1927 and they had a son. Josland completed a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Otago in 1935 and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Victoria University of Wellington in 1950./nJosland was initially a cadet in the Agricultural Department in Christchurch during which time he attended classes at Canterbury College.[5] In 1921, he was appointed Assistant in the Bacteriological Department of Southland Hospital in Invercargill, where he was employed for eighteen months.[6] Josland then became a Bacteriological Cadet attached to the Departments of Bacteriology and Pathology at the University of Otago Medical School where he worked under the supervision of Professors Eric D'Ath (pathology), Alexander Murray Drennan (pathology) and Charles Hercus (bacteriology).[7] During his time at the Medical School, among other things, Josland worked on the chemical methods of pollen extraction and the preparation of these extracts for the diagnosis and therapy of hay fever.[8] He also received training in recently developed methods of blood analysis from Dr Cedric Stanton Hicks.[9] Additionally, Josland spent a brief period employed as relieving bacteriologist at the District Hospital in Whang\u0101rei.[10]/nAccompanied by his family, Josland arrived in Upper Hutt near Wellington in 1929, at the invitation of Dr Cyril Hopkirk, to set up a biochemistry laboratory at the Wallaceville Animal Research Centre.[11] He later became Chief Bacteriologist at the centre, where, in addition to working under Dr Hopkirk, he worked under Dr Ira Cunningham and Dr John Francis Filmer. Josland initiated the Technicians' Training Scheme at the centre and supervised the training of technical staff.[12]/nUntil 1930, no organised biochemical work had been undertaken in New Zealand on the blood and urine of normal cattle and sheep.[13] Josland decided that his first priority should be an attempt to determine the normal values and limits for the purpose of standards.[14] This was done and became the standards upon which future biochemical investigations were based. Josland directed biochemical work towards various cattle and sheep diseases, including eclampsia, temporary sterility in cattle and pulpy kidney in lambs, blood from the latter showing no deviation from the normal.[15]/nJosland undertook post-graduate training under the direction of Hedley Marston at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory of the Commonwealth Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in Adelaide, Australia in 1935.[16] Dr Lionel Bull was head of the Laboratory and staff conducted research into animal nutrition problems. At the time, studies were being made of coast disease, which affected sheep, and metabolism in ewes. One of the problems of drought-feeding was to find the minimum energy requirements of the animal.[17] Josland's main purpose in going to the Laboratory was to get some application in biochemistry in the investigation of diseases in animals. He also studied cobalt deficiency.[18] Upon his return to New Zealand, Josland commented that \"[t]here seemed to be no dearth of money in Australia for research work [and] an amazing amount of money was made available from sources outside the Government, particularly the pastoral trusts and the banks\".[19]/nInvestigations carried out by workers both in Australia and New Zealand over a three-year period leading up to 1938 had demonstrated the profound importance to the health of livestock of a minute quantity of cobalt in the diet.[20] Coast disease and enzootic marasmus in Australia, and bush sickness, Morton Mains disease and Mairoa disease in New Zealand, were associated with cobalt deficiency in pastures and were curable, partially and entirely, when cobalt was supplied.[21] In addition to field experiments, Dr Cunningham undertook experimental work with rats in an attempt to gain knowledge of the function of cobalt in the animal system, and Josland investigated the blood-changes induced by cobalt deficiency.[22] This work was done at the Wallaceville Animal Research Centre.[23]/nWorking under Dr Filmer, Josland, together with six veterinary officers, two chemists and two staff from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, investigated the facial eczema epidemic affecting stock in the Waikato District in 1938.[24] The investigation embraced three fields, namely animal tissues, pastures, and soils.[25] The work on animal tissues, such as the chemical changes in blood, bile and liver, or the presence of unusual metabolic substances, was undertaken by Josland in collaboration with Dr Filmer, and they had the resources of the chemistry section of the Department of Agriculture at their disposal.[26]/nJosland began his military career in the Cadet Service with the West Christchurch District High School and the Canterbury and Southland Regiments between 1917 and 1921. He was then in the ranks of the territorial service during 1922 and 1923 before being commissioned into the Otago Regiment in 1923. Before the Second World War, Josland was a captain in the Twenty-fifth (Wellington) Battalion of the New Zealand Territorials. He went to the War as Second-in-Command of D Company in the Twenty-fifth Battalion (Third Echelon) of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force.[27] On 21 February 1941, Josland was seconded for duty as Liaison Officer, 6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand).[28] He relinquished this position and ceased to be seconded on 4 June 1941.[29] On 20 September 1941, Josland was appointed to command the Graves Registration and Inquiries Unit.[30] From 21 April 1942, he was Staff Captain to Brigadier General Sir Herbert Hart (general), who was the Assistant Director of the Graves Registration Unit, General Headquarters, Middle East and Chief Administrative Officer for the Imperial War Graves Commission, Eastern District.[31] Josland was later seconded to Persia and Iraq Command and the Graves Registration and Inquiries Unit, Mediterranean Pool where he served in the British Army and then in the Second Indian Division of the Indian Army in Iran and Iraq. On 5 July 1945, Josland was appointed temporary lieutenant colonel while employed with the British Forces.[32] He served in Greece, Italy, the Middle East and North Africa. Josland was fluent in Arabic and French[33] and qualified in Urdu. When the War was over, he returned to New Zealand with the rank of lieutenant colonel and was posted to the Retired List on 31 July 1946. Josland was presented with the Efficiency Decoration (New Zealand) by the Governor-General of New Zealand, on 31 August 1950, for his services to the New Zealand Army.[34] A collection of poems by Josland, reflecting on his experiences and impressions of the Middle East, and later Italy, during the period from 1941 to 1945, was published in 2005.[35]/nJosland returned to the Wallaceville Animal Research Centre in 1946. The use of precise serological methods of antigenic analysis had made possible the identification of organisms of the Salmonella group which had been isolated from material of animal origin at Wallaceville.[36] He was able to isolate only the two organisms - Salmonella Typhi Murium and Salmonella Cholera Suis.[37] This contrasted with overseas results where many types of Salmonella had been found.[38] In the 1950s, Josland prepared killed vaccines from Salmonella Typhi Murium and Salmonella Cholera Suis for use in pigs and sheep, respectively, but trial results were not encouraging.[39]/nJosland was the first to investigate the use of a vaccine to control Salmonellosis in sheep.[40] He discovered an injection of formalised alum-precipitated Salmonella Typhi Murium vaccine resulted in low and inconsistent antibody response.[41] Even though a greater number of vaccinated animals survived following challenge, compared to unvaccinated animals, he concluded that prophylactic vaccination was of little use.[42] He was able to recommend control measures but stressed that early diagnosis by the clinician, confirmed by laboratory analysis, was important if hygiene and isolation measures were to be successful.[43]/nFurther investigations carried out by Josland lead to the isolation, in New Zealand, of the Salmonella organism from all species of farm animals, from watering holes, and from pastures contaminated by infected faeces of such animals, and he showed, in a series of comprehensive field studies, that the organism when deposited in dung, water or pasture, could remain viable for periods ranging up to twenty-eight weeks.[44] Josland also found that the survival of Salmonella was less on pasture exposed to sun compared to shaded pasture.[45]/nIn 1954, Josland resigned from the Wallaceville Animal Research Centre to become chief bacteriologist at the National Health Institute, Department of Health, in Wellington.

They are also investigating the causes of the age-related decline in female fertility. Schuh's work focuses on the process of oocyte division, in which oocytes mature into eggs by extruding half of their chromosomes in a small cell termed the polar body.[10][11] This requires the spindle apparatus in these cells to be positioned asymmetrically. She discovered a role for proteins that control actin nucleation in the positioning of the spindle.[12] In studying how actin helps position the spindle, she discovered that vesicles carrying specific signals can change the organization and density of actin networks.[13] In addition, her group developed a strategy to perform high-content RNAi screens for meiotic genes in mouse oocytes.[14]/nErrors in oocyte division can lead to miscarriage and age-related female infertility. Working with Bourn Hall Clinic, the clinic that first pioneered IVF, Schuh studied human oocyte divisions directly, instead of using mouse oocytes as a model system. She found that human oocytes have a surprisingly slow and error-prone mechanism for assembling the meiotic spindle,[15] increasing the likelihood of segregation errors. She has also investigated the reasons why older mothers have a higher rate of pregnancy loss, and found that oocytes from older mothers have a higher frequency of defects in chromosome architecture.[16][17]/nHer lab developed a method for the acute degradation of endogenous proteins, called Trim-Away,[4] and established essential functions for actin[18] and a liquid-like spindle domain in acentrosomal spindle assembly.[19] Recent work from her lab has identified the cause of spindle instability in human oocytes[20] and an mRNA storage mechanism in mammalian oocytes.[21]", "28762688": "Nathan Bryan is an industrial researcher and adjunct assistant professor at the Baylor College of Medicine.[1] He received an undergraduate degree in biochemistry from the University of Texas at Austin[when?] and a Ph.D. from Louisiana State University.[when?] He studies nitric oxide restoration in humans, and he is co-founder of HumanN, a firm developing products to increase nitric oxide levels.[2]/nBryan has co-edited or written three books: Food, Nutrition & The Nitric Oxide Pathway,[3] Nitrates and Nitrites in Human Health and Disease,[4] and Blood & Tissue Nitric Oxide Products.[5]/n/nThis article about a biologist from the United States is a stub.

The work of Williams in this area, along with W. D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith, Richard Dawkins, and others led to the development of the gene-centered view of evolution in the 1960s./nWilliams' 1957 paper Pleiotropy, Natural Selection, and the Evolution of Senescence is one of the most influential in 20th century evolutionary biology, and contains at least 3 foundational ideas.[4] The central hypothesis of antagonistic pleiotropy remains the prevailing evolutionary explanation of senescence. In this paper Williams was also the first to propose that senescence should be  generally synchronized by natural selection. According to this original formulation/n... if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other, they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other. In other words, natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system./nThis important concept of synchrony of senescence was taken up a short time later by John Maynard Smith, and the origin of the idea is often misattributed to him, including in his obituary in the journal Nature.[5] Finally, Williams' 1957 paper was the first to outline the \"grandmother hypothesis\". William's formulation stated that natural selection might select for menopause and post-reproductive life in females (though not explicitly mentioning grandchildren or the inclusive fitness contribution of grand-parenting)./nIn his first book, Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), Williams advocated a \"ground rule - or perhaps doctrine would be a better term - ... that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary\",[6] and that, when it is necessary, selection among genes or individuals would in general be the preferable explanation for it. He elaborated this view in later books and papers, which contributed to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution. Richard Dawkins built upon Williams' ideas around selection and genes in his book The Selfish Gene (1976).[7]/nWilliams was also well known for his work on the evolution of sex, and was an advocate of evolutionary medicine./nIn Sex and Evolution (1975), he attempted to explain why many species use exclusive sexual reproduction despite its \u201ctwofold cost\". He proposed several explanatory models ( \u201caphid-rotifer model,\u201d the \u201cstrawberry-coral model,\u201d and \u201celm-oyster model\"), though found all of them insufficient.[8] He even considered the possibility that sex is a maladaption for some species:/nWhen major taxonomic groups all share a certain feature, it is unlikely that the feature has the same adaptive significance throughout the group. It may even be maladaptive for the majority... The fact that parthenogenesis or its equivalent, if found in a vertebrate population, has always replaced sexual reproduction entirely, is decisive evidence of the maladaptive nature of sexuality in these organisms. (Chapter 9)/nIn later books, including Natural Selection: Domains, Levels and Challenges, Williams softened his views on group selection, recognizing that clade selection, trait group selection and multilevel selection did sometimes occur in nature, something he had earlier thought to be so unlikely it could be safely ignored.[9][10]/nWilliams became convinced that the genic neo-Darwinism of his earlier years, while essentially correct as a theory of microevolutionary change, could not account for evolutionary phenomena over longer time scales, and was thus an \"utterly inadequate account of the evolution of the Earth's biota\" (1992, p. 31). In particular, he became a staunch advocate of clade selection \u2013 a generalisation of species selection to monophyletic clades of any rank \u2013 which could potentially explain phenomena such as adaptive radiations, long-term phylogenetic trends, and biases in rates of speciation/extinction. In Natural Selection (1992), Williams argued that these phenomena cannot be explained by selectively-driven allele substitutions within populations, the evolutionary mechanism he had originally championed over all others. This book thus represents a substantial departure from the position of Adaptation and Natural Selection.[11]/nWilliams received a Ph.D. in biology from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1955. At Stony Brook he taught courses in marine vertebrate zoology, and he often used ichthyological examples in his books./nIn 1992, Williams was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.[12] He won the Crafoord Prize for Bioscience jointly with Ernst Mayr and John Maynard Smith in 1999. Richard Dawkins describes Williams as \"one of the most respected of American evolutionary biologists\".[13]/nWilliams supervised an undergraduate project in 1985 which consisted of a student, Mitchell Behm, tossing live animals into tubs with domesticated ferrets, which Behm subsequently admitted he partly did \"for his own amusement.\" Dr. Charles Middleton, Director of the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources stated, \"If animals are just going to tear each other up, the experiment would not have been approved.\" Ferrets were illegal in New York at the time, without a license, which neither individual had./nAfter police investigation, Williams received a formal reprimand from SUNY Stony Brook for never receiving approval because of not detailing the pain of the animals involved, and for allowing non-campus animals to participate. Because the statute of limitations had expired, Williams narrowly escaped strict disciplinary action, in addition to criminal prosecution.

Some of these tracking methods include observing weather patterns, surface water temperatures, chlorophyll concentrations, and rainfall patterns. Colwell's findings of correlations between these phenomena showed that the infection rate of cholera is connected to water temperatures.

Ausubel.[11] In 1988 she joined the Salk Institute as an Assistant Professor. Chory eventually married her husband, Stephen Worland, with whom she has two adopted children./nIn 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. She has struggled with the disease for well over a decade, but with the help of medications and a brain implant to help regulate her movement, she has continued her genetic research. Along with her passion for genetics, Chory strives to inspire young women to become scientists and is constantly working to improve the field for women.[10]/nChory was not always interested in genetics. Her early career interests were centered in microbiology. Through her research in that field she developed a deeper interest in genetics, specifically research that was being done on Arabidopsis plants. Through her lengthy career in genetics she has been awarded numerous prestigious accolades for her many contributions to the field.[12]/nJoanne Chory focuses her research on finding a way to optimize plant growth to sustain a growing human population. She uses Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism, but her purpose is to optimize all plant growth and not just that of A. thaliana itself. She mutates the genes of the model organism and uses the results to understand the effects that these mutations have. She approaches this information from various directions including using genetics, genomics, cell biology, x-ray crystallography, biochemistry, and ecology. She has made strides in understanding light sensitivity and hormones in these plants. She uses this knowledge to optimize growth in other plants in hopes that we can better sustain a fast and ever-growing population.[1]/nChory shows particular appreciation for manipulation of phenotypes of an organism.[13] Light signals are required for the induction and regulation of many developmental processes in plants. She has participated in research dissecting this complex process by isolating mutations that alter light-regulated seedling development in Arabidopsis.[14][15] Her work has identified mutants that are deficient in the phytochrome photoreceptors and in nuclear-localized repressors and has also revealed that steroid hormones control light-regulated seedling development. Dr. Chory's lab has been involved in the manipulation of the biosynthetic pathway for these steroids that altered the growth and development of plants and identification of the putative steroid receptor, a transmembrane receptor kinase.[16] Her group has also contributed towards the understanding of chloroplast to nuclear retrograde signaling[17][18] and plant shade avoidance responses.[19][20]", "41443948": "Georg Seelig is a Swiss computer scientist, bioengineer, and synthetic biologist.

During his tenure as an MP from 1945 to 1949, he represented the constituency of Portuguese India, namely its overseas provinces of Goa, Daman and Diu in the National Assembly at Lisbon.[2]/nFroilano de Mello was born in Benaulim, Salcette to Goan Catholic parents. He was the eldest son of the lawyer Const\u00e2ncio Francisco de Mello, and Delfina Rodrigues, the daughter of Dr. Raimundo Ven\u00e2ncio Rodrigues. Rodrigues was the mayor of Coimbra, member of the Cortes Gerais in Portugal and one of the first directors of Goa Medical College (then known as the Escola Medico\u2013Cirurgica de Goa).[3]\nConst\u00e2ncio died when he was twelve, adversely affected the Mello family's fortunes, and brought about difficult times for the entire family. The income generated from the family properties managed by the caretaker was insufficient to meet the family's needs and consequently, the young Froilano had to work while he studied.[3] He graduated in Panjim as a medical doctor, and later repeated the course at Porto, Portugal. In 1910, he returned to Goa with an additional diploma in Tropical medicine of the University of Lisbon.[1]/nMello's academic career got a start in 1910, at the age of 23, when he was appointed as a professor at the prestigious Goa Medical College. From 1913 to 1914, he served as an assistant professor at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, and was a visiting professor at the University of Porto in 1921.[3] Mello was promoted to the post of director of the Goa Medical College's Bacteriological institute, a small shed in Campal which would serve as the center of his scientific research from 1914 to 1945.[1][3] His achievements in microbiology and parasitology made the institute world-famous largely because he ensured that all his works were simultaneously published in English, Portuguese and French.[4] Mello would later go on to become the college's dean.[1]/nDuring the same period, he also served as Chief of Public Health for Portuguese India.[3] He undertook a postgraduate course in parasitology in Kaiser Willhelm Institute fuer Biologie, Berlin, and at the Max Planck Institute, Potsdam, Germany from 1922 to 1923.[3] In 1922, at the age of 35, Mello became a Colonel in the Portuguese Army Medical Corps, achieving the highest rank in the medical military hierarchy of that time, exclusively through merits in the medical campaigns on Public Health which he carried out in Goa, Daman, Diu, and in Angola.[4] Mello was the head of a Portuguese delegation to the World Leprosy Conference in Cuba and is known to have attended at least 40 World Conferences,[4] including the All India Sanitary Conference in Lucknow (1914) and the Third Entomological Meeting in Lucknow (1914) where, at the invitation of the Governor-General of India, he lectured on medical mycology.[3] His researches in tropical medicine brought him international fame and recognition as a world-renowned expert on the subject.[4] Mello published more than 200 research papers on bacteriology in Portuguese, French and English journals.[1] He founded the following medical journals in Goa, Boletim Geral de Medicina, Arquivos Indo-Portugueses de Medicina e Historia Natural, and Arquivos da Escola Medico\u2013Cirurgica de Nova Goa.[3] His work in French entitled, A la veille du Centenaire (On the eve of the Centenary) elaborated in great detail the contributions of Goa Medical College during the first hundred years of its establishment.[4] Separate from his medical career, Mello also authored a book in 1946 on the Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore entitled O Cantico da Vida na Poesia Tagoreana (The song of life in the poetry of Tagore).[3]/nMello was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal; the Indian Academy of Sciences; Societie de Pathologie Exotique and Societie de Biologie de Paris in Paris; Sociedade de Ciencias Medicas, Sociedade de Etnologia & Antropologia and  Sociedade de Geografia in Lisbon.[3] He was the recipient of medals of honour from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1938, Pope Pius XII on the occasion of the canonisation of St. John de Brito in 1947, President Ram\u00f3n Grau of Cuba in 1949, and from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Brazil in 1950. He also held the following Portuguese honours: Grande Official da Ordem de Aviz, Comendador da Ordem de S\u00e3o Tiago and Comendador da Ordem de Benemerencia.[5]/nMello worked passionately to eradicate tuberculosis in Goa and malaria from Velha Goa.[1] His efforts towards this end, led to the establishment of two important institutions, namely the first leprosarium in Asia at Macas\u1e9ana in Salcette in 1934, today known as Leprosaria Froilano de Mello and Dispensario Virgem Peregrina at St. Inez, Panjim.[1][3] He also established the TB sanitarium in Margao in 1928 and opened a ward for those suffering from leprosy in Daman.[1][3] In 1926, Mello with the help of one of his pupils, Dr. Lu\u00eds Bras de Sa, carefully mapped the site of Old Goa and recognised more than 4,800 wells in the area, which were breeding grounds of anopheles mosquitoes. This led to the closure of these wells, and in turn, led to the reduction of the mosquito breeding sites. This factor played a significant role in curbing the Malaria epidemic in Goa in the 1920s.[3]/nMello also undertook new measures to improve urban sanitation, which included the introduction of Sanitary Police in Panjim.[1] Faced with the task of dealing with the city's rabies epidemic during his term as mayor, he ordered the elimination of all stray dogs, offering a reward per stray dog. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of cases of rabies. A similar reward was offered for the capture or destruction of venomous snakes, which led to the reduction of snakebites.[3]/nIn 1926, Mello was elected as a member of parliament to represent Portuguese India in Lisbon. However, after the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat, the elections were nullified and not held again for the next nineteen years.[3] Mello served as the mayor of Panjim from 1938 to 1945. During his tenure as mayor, he cleansed its stables of mismanagement and fiscal deficits, and his mayorship is widely noted for the city's urbanisation.[3]/nIn 1940, Mello devised a plan for the beautification of the city, particularly the church square, the present 18 June road and the Campal Zone. The latter still bears the imprint of the program carried out by him.[6] He organised the balustrade on the Mandovi River, from the centre of town up to Campal, lining the riverside avenue. He also planted trees in many of the streets of Panjim, with seeds of tropical trees from Cuba. These jacaranda and acacia trees, whose seedlings were planted in 1940, now provide shade to the streets which were originally lined only with coconut and ficus trees.[3]/nIn 1945, when the Portuguese parliament was re-opened, Mello was elected for the second time as MP to represent Portuguese India.[2] He was the only independent MP to serve in the Portuguese parliament for the period 1945\u201349; all the others being members of dictator Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar's Uni\u00e3o Nacional party.[3] However, Mello's independent status brought him into disfavour with Salazar, and his speeches in the National Assembly were censored.[2] Initially, Mello was staunchly pro-Portuguese and believed that Goa should remain under the Portuguese Empire.[7] In November 1946, at a National Assembly meeting at Lisbon, he denounced the unrest in Goa as the handiwork of a few \"Fifth Columnists and Nazis, and intellectuals educated in central Europe and fanatics who had failed in life, who preach the absorption of Goa and foment hatred of the Portuguese nation.\"[7]/nHe worked tirelessly for the repeal of the discriminatory Portuguese Colonial Act of 1930, which had previously relegated non-Portuguese citizens to second-class status in the Empire. The repeal of this discriminatory act was unanimously approved by the National Assembly in 1950.[3] With the repeal of the act granted, Mello now began to advocate independence for the Portuguese Indian colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu, which would govern itself as a separate national entity, but within the Portuguese Commonwealth.[2] This put him at further odds with the ruling Estado Novo regime, which considered their Indian colonies to be an integral part of Portugal and dismissed any ideas of independence.[3]/nAfter retiring to Goa, Mello was not put up as candidate for re-election through a political manoeuvre of the Salazar's single party regime.[2] In 1950, when the Fifth International Congress of Microbiology was to take place in Petropolis, Brazil, Mello who had expected to be nominated as the delegate of Portugal, found out to his surprise that Salazar had instead appointed another delegation without him. When this came to be known, the Brazilian Government invited him, providing for his travel and stay.[2]/nFinding himself under increased political persecution by Salazar's government in Goa, Mello emigrated with his wife to Brazil in 1951, where three of their children were already settled. He settled down in S\u00e3o Paulo, where he continued his research in the field of Protozoa, in the intestines of termites. He discovered various new species there which he dedicated to his new country.[8] He gave lectures and conferences in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo and was invited to organise the section of protozoology at the Instituto Ezequiel Dias in Belo Horizonte.[8] Mello died in S\u00e3o Paulo of lung cancer on 9 January 1955, aged 67. His last scientific paper, Memorias do Instituto Ezequiel Dias (Memoirs of the Ezequiel Dias Institute) was published in February 1955, a month after his death.[8]/nMello was married twice. His first wife was Marie Eugenie Caillat, an aristocratic Swiss from Geneva, who after marriage moved with him to Panjim. Eugenie was the first person to translate the works of Rabindranath Tagore into French. She died in 1921 from complications brought on by the Spanish flu virus in Porto. The couple did not have any children.[3]/nOn 15 September 1923, Mello married his second wife Hedwig Bachmann, a young Swiss school teacher from Diessenhofen. They had six children: Alfredo, Euge\u03aeia, Victor, Francisco Paulo, Cristina and Margarida.[8] Hedwig authored a book entitled Von der Seele der Indischen Frau (Tipografia Rangel, Goa, 1941) published also in translation, On the soul of the Indian women. The book is a psycho-sociological study of Hindu traditions as interpreted from proverbs and the impact of Aryan and Dravidian civilisations.[8] One of his sons, Alfredo Bachmann de Mello (1924\u20132010) was a well-known travel writer and memoirist who authored an auto-biography, From Goa to Patagonia: memoirs spanning times and spaces.[9] Another son, Victor Froilano Bachmann de Mello (1927\u20132009) was a world-renowned geotechnical engineer.[10]", "43115155": "Prof. Dr. Victor Lim Kok Eow (also rendered Victor K.E.

Throughout her career, she has disproved the idea that marsupial immune system is primitive, characterized the South American gray short-tailed opossum's immune genes, participated in the Platypus Genome Project, led research identifying the properties of platypus venom, and identified the cause of the spread of the Tasmanian devil's contagious cancer./nBelov is an advocate for Women in STEM and leads a research team of largely female students and post-doctoral students./nKatherine Belov was born in Sydney, Australia in 1973 to Nick and Larissa Belov. Both of her parents were immigrants to Australia and of Russian heritage. Belov grew up in West Ryde, New South Wales and pursued her undergraduate degree at Macquarie University in human genetics. She was persuaded to change from human genetics to animal genetics by Professor Des Cooper who would become her PhD supervisor, and initially worked on grey kangaroos, but quickly changed to the study of marsupials. She challenged a theory by another researcher who believed that marsupials did not have a highly developed immune system and proved that they had sophisticated immune systems comparable to our own. The research inspired her to enroll in a PhD program[1] on marsupial immunology at Macquarie University.[2] She earned her PhD in 2002, and began her postdoctoral work at the Australian Museum with an Australian Research Council Fellowship.[3]/nIn 2004, as part of the team, Belov became one of the primary researchers to sequence the genome of the platypus. The results, involving the work of over 100 international scientists, were published in Nature in May 2008. Among the findings were that the platypus has unique anti-microbial peptides with broad-spectrum potential for fighting a variety of bacteria and viruses, and possibly staph infections in humans.[1] Belov's research continued and she now leads her own team of researchers from the University of Sydney, they began to characterise the platypus venom, which has no antivenom and causes severe pain to humans. They were able to complete the analysis in 18 months, verifying seven snake-like zinc metalloproteinases, seven toxins similar to the alpha-latrotoxins of black widow spiders, six cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) like those found in some lizards and gila monsters, as well as some minor components similar to those of sea anemone venom.[4]/nIn 2007, Belov accepted a lectureship position at the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney[3] and began to focus on the contagious cancer, devil facial tumour disease, which started spreading through the Tasmanian devil population in 1996.[5] She proposed that the problem was that devils lack major histocompatibility complex gene diversity.[1] Belov proved her hypothesis, that devils do not mount an immune response to the cancer because the tumour's genetic makeup is so similar to their own.[6]/nBelov became a full Professor of Comparative Genomics at the University of Sydney and has received an Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Fellow award to[7] continue her research in identifying genes, not only for devils and platypuses, but for other native Australian species like skinks and wallabies.[8] In 2014, she was awarded the Fenner Medal for research in biology from the Australian Academy of Science.[9]/nIn 2016, she was appointed to the new role of Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Global Engagement) at the University of Sydney.[10] This role includes responsibility for managing the development and execution of the University's global engagement strategy./nBelov's research team made some prominent discoveries in 2016.

For the first five or six years of her schooling she attended a school in a western occupation zone of the city (\"West Berlin\"), but as the political division between the Soviet occupation zone and the western occupation zones became more stark and, it seemed, more permanent, her parents opted on her behalf for a school in the Soviet zone in what had by now become known as East Berlin.   The family home was in the city centre along Bernauer Stra\u00dfe (\"Bernau Street\") which formed the (initially hard to spot) political border between East Berlin and West Berlin, and afforded Regine a ring-side seat in the cold wall drama until September 1961 when the family were forcibly relocated in connection with the building of the Berlin Wall.[4]  In October 1961 she co-founded and joined the interdenominational choir at Berlin's (Protestant) Cathedral, which now flourished under the musical direction of a man called Herbert Hildebrand.[5]/nFrom 1959 to 1964, she studied  biology at the Humboldt University in East Berlin.[4]/nShe had never joined the Free German Youth (FDJ/Freie Deutsche Jugend), which was in effect the youth wing of the young country's[6] ruling SED party. Her failure to join seems to have been a result of timetable clashes involving her commitment to singing in the church choir.[5] Failure to enroll in the FDJ had nevertheless led to her application for the university course to be initially rejected; and subsequent failure as an adult to become a Party Member would constrain her career opportunities right up until 1989.[5]/nBetween 1964 and 1978 Regine Radischewski worked in a management position involving Quality Control in the pharmacology department of VEB Berlin-Chemie, a major conglomerate in East Berlin.[4] Hildebrandt combined her responsibilities in the pharmaceuticals department with a medicines research project at the Humboldt University which led to her receiving her doctorate in 1978.  In 1978 she took a senior research position at Berlin's Centre for the Study of Metabolism Illnesses and Diabetes, heading up the Diabetes department until 1990.[4][7] During this period she had numerous research papers published.[4]/nDuring these years she also found time, in 1966 to marry J\u00f6rg Hildebrandt,[1] brother of the musical director of the choir in which they sang.   The two had known each other through the church since 1950:  they had also been near neighbours, with a shared childhood experience of living along the East\u2013West front-line before 1961.  The marriage produced three children, born in 1969, 1971 and 1974.[4]   Her research career left her with enough space to devote time to the family, which was very important to her.   Her husband later recalled that they ate together each evening six days per week, and on Sundays had a family lunch in the middle of the day after getting back from church.[5]   When she died, aged 60, she would still be living with younger family members in a large \"multi-generational family house\" they had been able to have built after 1990.[3]/nThe family participated the political life of the  one-party dictatorship only when they felt they had to.[5] They did not vote in the country's sham elections because \u00a722 of the constitution did not oblige them to vote[5] (although the 1986 General election resulted, typically, in a reported turnout of 99.74%).   Regine Hildebrand did join the national Trade Union Federation (FDGB/Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund) because not to have done so would have deprived her research colleagues of vital funding.[5]   When fraternal tanks appeared on the streets of Prague to crush political reform, the Hildebrandts joined in a protest demonstration outside the Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin./nThey would write letters of protest to the Party Central Committee and to Neues Deutschland, the party's mass-circulation official daily newspaper.[5] Hildebrand assiduously read Neues Deutschland and followed other official media, if only to keep herself up to date with The Party's politically correct linguistic contrivances of the moment.[5]  The family never owned a television set, but news came from radio programmes broadcast from West Berlin or London, and from friends who visited from the west and were permitted (unlike East German citizens) to return to the west afterwards.[5]/nThe summer of 1989 brought a dramatic change in her life when she, together with her husband, J\u00f6rg, was among the co-founders of Democracy Now, which sought an alliance of Christians and critical Marxists \"to think about our future, to think about a society based on solidarity\".[7]/nOn 12 October 1989 she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which (in East Germany) had been re-founded five days earlier.[5]   The Hildebrandts valued the embracing compassionate socialism of the moderate left which had been nurtured and demonstrated by iconic (western) SPD figures from the recent past such as Kurt Schumacher and Willy Brandt.[5]   A year later, following reunification, in October 1990 the party would merge formally with the West German Social Democratic Party (SDP)./n1990 was the year in which, for rather less than a year, she became an important Social Democratic participant in the national politics of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).   National elections in the GDR had traditionally operated according to a single list system which offered the voters only one list of (carefully preselected) candidates.  Anyone wishing to vote against the list could do so by placing the ballot paper in a separate ballot box while the officials looked on:  few did.   But on 18 March 1990 the German Democratic Republic conducted its first (and as matters turned out, last) democratically configured general election.  The Social Democrats took 21.9% of the vote which entitled them to 88 seats in the country's first freely elected National legislative assembly (Volkskammer). One of the seats went to Hildebrand, representing the Berlin electoral district. She also joined the coalition government of Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re, serving between April and August 1990 as the East German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs.[8]/nA political decision had been taken to convert East German currency into western Marks at a one-for one rate (except in respect of very large amounts), and Hildebrandt's priority as a government minister was tackling growing unemployment in east Germany,[5] following economic disruption associated with the ongoing reunification process.[citation needed]/nThe governing coalition started to splinter in August 1990 leading to the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from it, as a result of which Regine Hildebrandt terminated her career as a government minister at the national level.[8] The next month, however, in 1990 she was elected to the national committee of the SPD (for the whole of Germany, even though national reunification would not be formally enacted until October).[2]/nHildebrandt now became a key SPD figure in the state politics of Brandenburg. In October 1990, the state tier of government was reintroduced to what had been the German Democratic Republic, and as part of the process elections took place for a new state parliament in Brandenburg on 26 October. Hildebrandt was elected as an SPD member and then appointed to ministerial office under minister-president Manfred Stolpe: from 1 November 1990 onwards she served as Brandenburg's Minister for Labour, Social affairs, Health and Women,[1][2] in effect an expanded version of the ministerial portfolio she had been handling nationally earlier in the year.[5]/nShe was a popular and effective minister, often hitting the headlines with less than diplomatic outbursts, always charmingly reasonable but also forcefully persuasive with key colleagues when, as often happened, issues within her ministerial ambit came down to arguments about funding.[5] In the popular media she frequently attracted the soubriquet \"Mother Courage\".[3]/nIn the 1999 Brandenburg state election the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority[9] and minister-president Manfred Stolpe prepared to form a \"grand coalition\" with the centre-right CDU party. Hildebrand was already seriously ill and had strongly campaigned for an alternative alliance, with the left-wing PDS.[4] She resigned from the state government.[10]/nThe Hildebrandts and the state prime minister Manfred Stolpe had known one another since the 1960s through their church connections, though they had not been aware at every level of Stolpe's complicated and possibly at times collaborative relationship with the Ministry for State Security during the years of the dictatorship. After her resignation from the government Hildebrand and Stolpe would continue to treasure one another's friendship, and remain political allies, until Hildebrandt's death in 2001.[5]/nNationally in December 1999 and again in November 2001, a few weeks before she died, Hildebrand topped the polls in the elections to the national executive of the Social Democratic Party.[4]/nIn July 1996 it became known that Regine Hildebrandt had breast cancer. She died at age 60 on 26 November 2001 in Woltersdorf, Brandenburg.[7]", "2089648": "Robert Ludlow \"Bob\" Trivers (/\u02c8tr\u026av\u0259rz/; born February 19, 1943) is an American evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist.

He has also contributed by explaining self-deception as an adaptive evolutionary strategy (first described in 1976) and discussing intragenomic conflict.[2]/nTrivers studied evolutionary theory with Ernst Mayr and William Drury at Harvard from 1968 to 1972, when he earned his PhD in biology.[3] At Harvard he published a series of some of the most influential and highly cited papers in evolutionary biology. His first major paper as a graduate student was \"The evolution of reciprocal altruism\", published in 1971.[4] In this paper Trivers offers a solution to the longstanding problem of cooperation among unrelated individuals and by doing so overcame a crucial problem for how to police the system by proposing ways that the process of natural selection could evolve ways to detect cheaters. His next major work, \"Parental investment and sexual selection\", was published the following year. Here Trivers proposed a general framework for understanding sexual selection that had eluded evolutionary thinkers since Charles Darwin. Arguably his most important paper, it arose from watching male and female pigeons out the window of his third floor apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and by his reading a 1948 paper by Angus Bateman (\u201cIntra-sexual selection in Drosophila\u201d) which demonstrated that sex differences in the intensity of selection in fruit flies were based on their ability to obtain mates.[5] The primary insight of Trivers was that the key variable underlying the evolution of sex differences across species was relative parental investment in offspring./nTrivers was on the faculty at Harvard University from 1973 to 1978, and then moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz where he was a faculty member 1978 to 1994.

Trivers said that he was told to teach the class even though he objected that he knew nothing about the specific subject. In his first lecture, Trivers told the class he would do his best to learn the subject along with them and with the help of guest lecturers. Rutgers suspended Trivers for involving the students in the controversy. Trivers told the Rutgers campus newsletter that Rutgers's officials refused to meet with him. Trivers also told the student paper: \"You would think the university would show a little respect for my teaching abilities on subjects that I know about and not force me to teach a course on a subject that I do not at all master.\"[13] Trivers has had a contentious few years at Rutgers.[14]/nTrivers is among the most influential evolutionary theorists alive today.[15] Steven Pinker considers Trivers to be \"one of the great thinkers in the history of Western thought\", who has:[16]/n...inspired an astonishing amount of research and commentary in psychology and biology\u2014the fields of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, Darwinian social science, and behavioral ecology are in large part attempt to test and flesh out Trivers's ideas. It is no coincidence that E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology and Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene were published in 1975 and 1976 respectively, just a few years after Trivers's seminal papers. Both bestselling authors openly acknowledged that they were popularizing Trivers's ideas and the research they spawned.

Karavolas (Dept. of Physiological Chemistry) and Prof. Robert W. Goy (Dept. of Psychology). His Ph.D. thesis research on the \"Mechanism of electron transport to cytochrome P-450 in adrenal cortex mitochondrial steroid monooxygenase systems\" was carried out under the supervision of Prof. Colin R. Jefcoate. He received his Ph.D. diploma in August 1980./nProf. Hanukoglu's scientific work concentrated in three different areas outlined below./nHanukoglu's career in molecular biology started at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Chicago (1980-1983 with Elaine Fuchs), where he cloned and sequenced cDNAs coding for cytoskeletal proteins, actin[4] and alpha keratins.[5][6] He elucidated the first structures of cytoskeletal keratin families, and predicted the long helical domains of these proteins. By computerized analysis of amino acid sequences he predicted that the central rod domain of intermediate filament proteins is composed of four helical segments separated by three short linker sequences. Later crystallographic studies have confirmed this as a general model for intermediate filament protein structure.[7][8]/nDuring his Ph.D. thesis research, Israel isolated the mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones in all steroidogenic tissues, including the adrenal cortex, and the reproductive organs.[9] The first step of steroidogenesis is dependent on the transfer of electrons from NADPH to a P450 type enzyme (P450scc) via an electron-transfer chain that includes two additional proteins.[10] These proteins are located on the inner mitochondrial membrane.[11] Israel reconstituted this system using proteins he purified,  characterized the process of electron transfer between the proteins, and built a kinetic model that simulated precisely the dynamic behavior of this complex system.[12][9]/nIn his first academic position at the Department of Biology at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, he first determined the molar stoichiometry of the mitochondrial P450 system proteins using specific antibodies that he generated.[13] He then set out to clone the cDNAs and the genes that code for these enzymes. His lab was the first to clone the cDNAs and the gene coding for adrenodoxin reductase - the first enzyme in the electron transfer chain of the mitochondrial P450 system.[14][15][16]/nBy sequence and structural analyses of adrenodoxin reductase, Israel identified its binding sites for the electron donor and acceptor coenzymes, NADPH and FAD.[15] By sequence analyses of the large oxidoreductase type of enzyme families, he noted that the FAD-binding site is a classical Rossmann fold, but the NADPH binding site has a different consensus sequence that could be responsible for NAD vs. NADP coenzyme specificity. The importance of the motifs he identified was confirmed by re-engineering of coenzyme specificities of different enzymes.[17] Elucidation of the crystal structure of adrenodoxin reductase further verified Israel's identification of the coenzyme binding sites.[18] Analysis of the phylogeny of this enzyme in eukaryotes showed that the NADP binding site sequence is strictly conserved.[19]/nAs the steroidogenic tissues have very high levels of antioxidants, Israel suspected that the P450 systems may leak electrons producing oxygen radicals. He examined this issue and showed that indeed, electrons that leak during the action mitochondrial P450 systems generate reactive oxygen species.[20][21][22] His studies also showed that in bovine ovary, levels of antioxidants are coordinately regulated with steroidogenesis.[23]/nHis other work in this field includes elucidation of the mechanism of action of corticotropin (ACTH) in regulating steroid hormone synthesis in the adrenal cortex,[24][25] regulation of adrenal steroidogenic capacity in disease states,[26] and the cloning and elucidation of the structure of ACTH receptor.[27]/nIn this field, Israel organized the first International Symposium in Molecular Steroidogenesis in Jerusalem in 1991 which served as the cornerstone for a continuing series of  international symposia for scientists who specialize in this field.[28]/nIn his clinical work as an endocrinologist, Israel's older brother, Prof. Aaron Hanukoglu (Tel Aviv University, Sackler Medical School and E. Wolfson Medical Center), identified that a hereditary disease named pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) type I encompasses two independent syndromes.[29] Following this discovery the two brothers continued their collaboration to understand the molecular basis of the severe form of PHA./nBy their collaborative work that also included additional labs, the Hanukoglu brothers discovered that the severe forms of pseudohypoaldosteronism type I result from mutations in three genes (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1B) that encode for protein subunits of the Epithelial sodium (Na+) channel (ENaC).[30][31][32][33] These studies also helped establish that ENaC is the principal channel involved in blood volume and blood pressure regulation in humans.[34]/nFollowing these studies, the Hanukoglu brothers directed their attention to understand the structure and function of ENaC assembled from normal and mutated subunits. Their analyses showed that the phenotypic variations in the severity of pseudohypoaldosteronism are associated with the types of genetic mutations.[35][36] Their work on the structure of ENaC subunits led to the identification of charged residues and regions responsible for transport of the protein to membrane and for regulation of extracellular Na+ ions.[37][38]/nIn an extensive review of studies on ASIC and ENaC, Prof. Hanukoglu has summarized the major similarities between ASIC and ENaC type channels.[39]/nTo define the sites of localization of ENaC in tissues and within cells, Hanukoglu's laboratory generated polyclonal antibodies against extracellular ENaC subunits. These antibodies for the first time permitted visualization of intracellular localization of ENaC at high resolution and led to the discovery that in all cells with motile cilia ENaC is located on cilia.[40] These studies establish that ENaC is an important regulator of fluid level in the luminal side of cells with motile cilia in the female reproductive and respiratory tract.[40] More recently, they showed that these sodium channels are also located in the seminiferous tubules in the testis and in the tail and head region of sperm.[41]/nSystemic pseudohypoaldosteronism patients with mutated ENaC subunits may lose significant amount salt in sweat especially at hot climates.[29] To identify the sites of salt loss, Hanukoglu brothers examined the localization of ENaC in the human skin.[42] In a comprehensive study examining all the layers of skin and epidermal appendages, they found a widespread distribution of ENaC in keratinocytes in the epidermal layers. Yet, in the eccrine sweat glands, ENaC was localized on the apical cell membrane exposed to the duct of these sweat glands. Based on additional observations, they concluded that the ENaC located on the eccrine gland sweat ducts is responsible for the uptake of Na+ ions from sweat secretions. This recycling of Na+ reduces the concentration of salt in perspiration and prevents the loss of salt at hot climates via perspiration.[42]/nIn addition to the personal prizes above, the research presentations from the laboratory of Prof. Hanukoglu received four awards at national and international meetings./nBesides a scientific career, Hanukoglu has maintained an active academic and civic leadership role.

When he first began college at the University of Texas at Austin, he planned to go to medical school rather than pursue research.[2] However, he quickly developed a passion for research after working as an undergraduate student in a chronobiology lab directed by Dr. Michael Menaker. Johnson asserts that \"music led [him] to science,\" as he originally began his research job with Menaker to pay for classical voice lessons. Classical music has remained a major avocation, as he continues to sing music with the chorus of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra.[4] Also in his free time, he enjoys yoga.[2]/nJohnson graduated with a B.A. in Honors Liberal Arts (the Plan II Honors program [5]) at the University of Texas at Austin in 1976. During this time, he became involved in undergraduate research under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Menaker, whose lab was studying biological clocks in birds and rodents.[6][7][8] Johnson's exposure to the practice of experimental research in Dr. Menaker's lab inspired him to go to graduate school instead of following his original plan to become a physician.[2] He went on to earn his Ph.D. in biology in 1982 at Stanford University, first working under the renowned leader in chronobiology, Colin Pittendrigh and then moving to David Epel's laboratory to finish his degree. Subsequently, Johnson conducted postdoctoral work in Cell & Developmental Biology at Harvard University, which he completed in 1987, with Dr. J.W. 'Woody' Hastings (John Woodland Hastings), a biologist famous for his work on bioluminescence in many organisms, including algae.[9] Hastings became a close friend and mentor to Johnson. In 1987, Johnson came to Vanderbilt University to initiate an independent research program, and he has been a biology professor at Vanderbilt since then.[2][3]/nJohnson's initial foray into research was as an undergraduate in Menaker's lab, which was working on the pineal gland in birds[7][10] and other chronobiology projects in vertebrates.[8] In graduate school at Stanford under Colin Pittendrigh, Johnson attempted to discover circadian rhythms in a variety of organism such as leeches and cockroaches. He also worked with earthworms to see whether they would completely recover circadian rhythms upon regeneration of lesioned parts of their brains. He also developed a method to measure the pH levels inside cells in search of rhythmic acid/base relationships.  However, only one of these projects ultimately resulted in a publication, namely a paper about the clock's control over the pH in the bread mould Neurospora crassa.[11] Johnson switched to David Epel's marine biology lab [12] in his fourth year of graduate school, because their work on the pH change in sea urchin and starfish eggs upon fertilization was an excellent system in which to apply the method he had developed earlier to measure the pH levels inside cells.[13][14] He successfully published a number of papers on this topic.[15][16] In his postdoctoral studies with Hastings, Johnson returned to the biological clocks field and worked mainly on rhythms in the bioluminescent alga Gonyaulax polyedra[17][18] and later in the algal model system for genetics, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.[19]/nPrior to the late 1980s, most chronobiologists believed that bacteria were too \"simple\" to express circadian rhythms.[20] Johnson did not accept this dogma, and as early as 1978, he was examining haloarchaea for the possible presence of biological clocks. While the studies of haloarchaea were not productive, when other studies suggested the possibility of circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria,[21][22] Johnson along with colleagues and collaborators used a luciferase reporter system to prove that Synechococcus elongatus, of the phylum cyanobacteria, showed evidence of daily bacterial circadian rhythms (with circa-24 hour cycles).[23] Synechococcus expressed free-running rhythms, temperature compensation, and ability to entrain, which are the defining properties of circadian rhythms.[1] These organisms also regulate cell division with forbidden and allowed phases.[24] Therefore, Johnson and coworkers challenged the original belief that bacteria do not have daily biological cycles. Moreover, they identified the central elements of the bacterial clock, namely the KaiABC gene cluster, and determined their structure.[25] Currently, the idea that bacterial circadian rhythms exist in at least some prokaryotes is well accepted by the chronobiology community, and prokaryotes are an important model system for studying rhythmicity.[26]/nIn 1999, Johnson and his team developed and patented a new method of studying the interaction of molecules based on F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), also known as Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).[27] They modified the existing technique of FRET so that instead of using light to activate fluorophores attached to the proteins of interest, they employed bioluminescent proteins with luciferase activity. BRET eliminates the need for light excitation and so avoids changes that light generally causes in circadian clocks, such as resetting the clock phase. Because it avoids light excitation (as in the case of FRET), BRET can also be helpful (1) when tissues are autofluorescent, (2) when light excitation causes phototoxicity, photoresponses (as in retina), or photobleaching, and (3) in partnership with optogenetics.[28] This new method for measuring protein-protein interactions gives researchers the ability to develop novel reporters for intracellular calcium and hydrogen ions. This method is projected to be extremely useful for researchers dealing with live cell cultures, cell extracts and purified proteins./nThe Johnson Lab is currently applying biophysical methods to explain how the central bacterial clock proteins (KaiA + KaiB + KaiC) oscillate in vitro.[26][29][30] Together with the laboratory of Dr. Martin Egli, Dr. Johnson's lab has led a concerted effort to apply structural biology techniques for insight into circadian clock mechanisms.[25][31] The lab has also used mutants and codon bias in cyanobacteria to provide the first rigorous evidence for the adaptive significance of biological clocks in fitness.[32][33][34] The Johnson lab is expanding the study of bacterial circadian rhythms from cyanobacteria to purple bacteria.[26][35] Currently the lab is also conducting studies on the circadian system of mammals in vivo and in vitro, by using luminescence as a tool to monitor circadian rhythms in the brain.[28] Finally, Johnson and his lab is studying circadian and sleep phenotypes of mouse models of the serious human neurodevelopmental disorder called Angelman syndrome.

Lindgren and other research associates, Gofman discovered and described three major classes of plasma lipoproteins, fat molecules that carry cholesterol in the blood. The team he led at the Donner Laboratory went on to demonstrate the role of lipoproteins in the causation of heart disease./nGofman was instrumental in inducing the health-physics scientific community both to acknowledge the cancer risks of ionizing radiation and to adopt the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model as a means of estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation and as the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection. However, his conclusions were that the dose-response relationship was not linear, but supra-linear.[3]/nGofman's earliest research was in nuclear physics and chemistry, in close connection with the Manhattan Project. He codiscovered several radioisotopes, notably uranium-233 and its fissionability; he was the third person ever to work with plutonium and, having devised an early process for separating plutonium from fission products at J. Robert Oppenheimer's request,[4] he was the first chemist ever to try and isolate milligram quantities of plutonium.[5]/nIn 1963 Gofman established the Biomedical Research Division for the Livermore National Laboratory, where he was on the cutting edge of research into the connection between chromosomal abnormalities and cancer./nLater in life, Gofman took on a role as an advocate warning of dangers involved with nuclear power. From 1971 on, he was Chairman of the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"his pioneering work in exposing the health effects of low-level radiation\" on the Chernobyl disaster's area population.[6]/nIn his 1996 book[3] Gofman claimed that exposure to medical x-rays was responsible for about 75 percent of breast cancers in the United States. This order of magnitude appears to correlate with the increase in breast-cancer incidence following mammography screening in the US and France.[7]/nJohn Gofman graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor's in chemistry in 1939, and received a doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry from Berkeley in 1943, where he worked as a graduate student under Glenn T. Seaborg, the discoverer of plutonium and later a chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. In his PhD dissertation, Gofman described the discovery of radioisotopes protactinium-232, uranium-232, protactinium-233, as well as uranium-233 and the characterization of its fissionability.[1] Seaborg had a very high opinion of Gofman\u00a0: he called Gofman one of his \"most brilliant students\" when, in 1963, he appointed him to head the Biomedical Research Division at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory;[8] he wrote that his PhD dissertation was \"very brilliant\".[9]/nGofman shared three patents with collaborators on their discoveries\u00a0:/nGofman later became the group co-leader of the Plutonium Project, an offshoot of the Manhattan Project.[11]/nDr. Gofman earned his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco, in 1946. After that, he and his collaborators investigated the body's lipoproteins, which contain both proteins and fats, and their circulation within the bloodstream. The researchers described low-density and high-density lipoproteins and their roles in metabolic disorders and coronary disease. This work continued throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s.[11]/nAt the request of Ernest Lawrence, Gofman established the Medical Department at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in early 1954 and acted as the medical director until 1957 roughly two days a week while teaching at Berkeley the rest of the time.[12]/nIn 1962, the US had resumed atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons at the Nevada test site in 1962. The State of Utah had set up its own network of monitoring facilities to test milk for radioiodine, since \"data pertaining to the safety of the citizens of Utah was not forthcoming from the AEC\",[13] and the levels of radioactivity were found to be close to the limits prescribed by the Federal Radiation Council. The Commissioners of the AEC were \"on the hot seat\" and announced \"a comprehensive, long-range program\" to explore the effects of man-made radioactivity \"upon plants, animals and human beings\".[14] At the request of the US Atomic Energy Commission and of LLNL's director John Foster, Gofman reluctantly accepted to establish the Biomedical Research Division for the LLNL in 1963. He served as the first director of the LLNL biomedical research division from 1963 to 1965 and as one of the nine associate directors of the entire lab until 1969.[15]/nThe AEC had acted too fast in response to public outcry\u00a0: one of the five Commissioners, James T. Ramey, had not been consulted before announcing the establishment of the Biomedical Research Division. Gofman reported that \"Apparently it would have been too embarrassing, with the extensive AEC publicity about the program, to cancel it outright. Instead, the budget was cut even from the low starting value and we were given to understand, in no uncertain terms, that the program was not going to be supported at the level required to do the tasks outlined originally.\" However, Gofman and colleagues \"accepted the reduced program, knowing that [they] could certainly still do much of the important work on radiation hazards.\"/nAfter the atmospheric test ban treaty was signed in June 1963 and the public pressure on AEC was released, \"[t]he Joint Committee on Atomic Energy struck from the AEC budget the funds that were to be used to construct a Bio-Medical complex at Livermore. This was tantamount to the JCAE stating that the Livermore Bio-Medical Program was unnecessary, for without facilities to work in it was hard to envision much of a program being possible.\" LLNL's director John Foster and Gofman had to struggle to obtain the initially promised funds.\n[16]/nIn 1959, the geneticist Edward B. Lewis computed that children exposed to fallout from nuclear tests may have received very high doses of radioactivity from iodine-131 in cow milk. His estimates prompted the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to request that the AEC produce a report on the risks of short-lived isotopes.[17] In 1960, Harold A. Knapp, a mathematician working within the AEC Division of Biology and Medicine's Fallout Studies Branch, authored this report,[18] but since it was finished during an international moratorium on atmospheric nuclear tests, it had no notable impact. Then, in 1962, while the USSR and the USA had resumed nuclear tests and the Limited Test Ban Treaty was being prepared in response to huge international pressure, Knapp took on the task of estimating the radioiodine exposure of Americans before 1958, at a time when milk was not monitored. Knapp conclusions were alarming, and blatantly departed from preceding AEC's reassurances that the public had never been exposed to harmful levels of radioactivity. He \"showed that, from just one 1953 test, infants who had been living in a radiation hotspot around St. George, Utah, might well have received I-131 doses anywhere from 150 to 750 times existing annual permissible doses.\"[19]/nBeginning in fall 1962, the AEC resorted to diverse pretexts to block the publication of Knapp's findings. In spring 1963, Gofman, was solicited to participate in a so-called \"Ad Hoc Working Group on Radioiodine and the Environment\" assembled by AEC's Division of Operational Safety's director, Gordon Dunning. Gofman reported that \"In essence, the message to [this] Committee [\u2026] was \u00ab\u00a0How can we stop this report - a report which will, in effect, make the AEC reports over the past 10 years look untrue?\u00a0\u00bb\".[20] In spite of AEC's Headquarters' objections, the committee recommended publication of Knapp's report, which was finally published by the AEC in June 1963,[21] followed by a summary in Nature.[22]/nIn 1964, Gofman raised questions about a lack of data on low-level radiation and also proposed a wide-ranging study of exposure in medicine and the workplace at a symposium for nuclear scientists and engineers. This helped start a national inquiry into the safety of atomic power. With his colleague Dr. Arthur R. Tamplin, Dr. Gofman then looked at health studies of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as other epidemiological studies, and conducted research on radiation's influences on human chromosomes. The two scientists suggested that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures be reduced by 90 percent in 1969. The Atomic Energy Commission contested the findings, and \"the furor made Dr. Gofman a reluctant figurehead of the anti-nuclear movement\" according to The New York Times.[11]  In 1970, he testified in favor of a bill to ban commercial nuclear reactors in New York City and told the City Council that a reactor in an urban environment would be \"equal in the opposite direction to all the medical advances put together in the last 25 years.\"[11]/nGofman and Tamplin were instrumental in inducing the health physics scientific community both to acknowledge the somatic (i.e. leukemia and cancer) risks of ionizing radiation, at a time when only the genetic risks were considered of significant concern, and to adopt the so-called Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model \"as a means of numerically estimating actual cancer risks from low-level radiation\", which \"was a watershed event in radiation-safety science and politics\".[23] The LNT model has since become the foundation of the international guidelines for radiation protection./nIndeed, it was Gofman and Tamplin's argumented opposition to the Federal Radiation Council (FRC) radiation-safety guidelines who prompted the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), on the recommendation made in December 1969 by Victor Bond, \"a prominent health physicist and chairman of the NAS-NRC Subcommittee on Radiobiology of the Committee on Nuclear Science\",[24] to gather its first BEIR (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) committee. According to an internal memo cited by Semendeferi, the BEIR I committee was to \"thoroughly digest and carefully analyze various pertinent controversial models (Gofman and Tamplin)\".[25]/nAfter two years of study, the BEIR I committee published its famous BEIR I report in November 1972. Although departing from Gofman and Tamplin's work on significant aspects, it nevertheless vindicated their arguments to a large extent. Semendeferi notes that \"[t]he report's long bibliography cited almost all of Gofman and Tamplin's work. Echoing Gofman and Tamplin, the BEIR I Committee emphasized that the cancer effects of low-level radiation were of much greater concern than leukemia or genetic effects. The current radiation limit was \"based on genetic considerations,\" and the committee concluded that the FRC limit was therefore \"unnecessarily high\" and could safely be much lower.\"[26]/nSemendeferi reports that, according to the radiobiologist and environmental health specialist Edward Radford, who was a member of the BEIR I committee and the chairman of the BEIR III committee, \"Gofman deserved credit for raising the issue of the somatic ris's of low-level radiation as early as he did\", but \"never received the recognition he deserved for his contributions to radiation-safety science\" because he was \"stigmatized as an extreme antinuclear scientist\".[23]/nGofman retired as a teaching professor in 1973 and became a professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology./nGofman testified on the behalf of Samuel Lovejoy at Lovejoy's 1974 trial. Lovejoy was charged with malicious destruction of property for toppling a weather tower in Montague, Massachusetts, owned by Northeast Utilities. Lovejoy's actions were an act of protest against a proposed nuclear power plant, Montague Nuclear Power Plant, to be built on Montague Plains. Lovejoy was inspired by Gofman's book, Poisoned Power./nGofman used his low-level radiation health model to predict 333 excess cancer or leukemia deaths from the 1979 Three Mile Island accident.[27] Studies of the health effects of the Three Mile Island accident have so far (by 2013) not observed any excess mortality. A retrospective study of Pennsylvania Cancer Registry found an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in counties south of TMI and in high-risk age groups.[28] The Talbott lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported finding only a few, small, mostly statistically non-significant, increased cancer risks within the TMI population. However, excess leukemia among males was observed.[29] The ongoing TMI epidemiological research has been accompanied by a discussion of epidemiological methodology, such as problems in dose and illness classifications.[30][31]/nThree months after the Chernobyl disaster, Gofman predicted that Chernobyl would cause \"475,000 fatal cancers plus about \nan equal number of additional non-fatal cases, occurring over time both inside and outside the ex-Soviet Union\".[32] In contrast, even some 19 years later in September 2005, an official UN IAEA report claimed 4,000 deaths as the final estimated toll from Chernobyl.[33]  In their 2006 book Alexey V. Yablokov and other Russian and East European researchers estimated that Chernobyl caused a million deaths through 2004, nearly 170,000 of them in North America.  The book's English translation Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment was published by the New York Academy of Sciences in 2009. The book cites \"5,000 mainly Slavic-language scientific papers the IAEA overlooked\", notwithstanding the fact that 13 of the authors of the Chernobyl Forum were from Ukraine, Russia or Belarus.[34][35] M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book.[35] M. I. Balonov criticized the methodology of the book's estimation of Chernobyl's excess deaths and radiation-induced health effects and claimed the numbers were exaggerations which \"could lead quite unnecessarily to a panic reaction\".[36] Rosalie Bertell has asserted the above estimates of Gofman (1986) and Yablokov (2006) are too conservative.[33]/nAfter a speech Gofman gave on nuclear waste at a national conference of activists in the summer of 1990, Charles Butler approached him for help. Butler was a retired physicist living in the Mojave Desert town of Needles, California, and was looking for help to stop the proposed low-level nuclear waste facility at Ward Valley. Gofman referred him to the Abalone Alliance Clearinghouse in San Francisco. With less than two weeks before the closure of the Environmental Impact Statement, the Alliance was able to mount a letter writing campaign that helped delay the EIS for an additional 90 days. This initial delay gave activists the time to form Don't Waste California and build a grassroots campaign that eventually stopped Ward Valley from opening./nGofman also did work on the Diablo Canyon Power Plant./nGofman considered that \"nuclear deterrence is important\", for he did not believe that comprehensive test bans were enforceable; thus he favored underground atomic bomb tests while acknowledging that \"They are harmful, a little will leak out. A small number of people will get hurt.\" He claimed \"I don't understand the disarmament movement\".[12] More precisely, he was of the opinion that if the US were to disarm unilaterally, \"the Soviet leaders may well try to make [the US] a slave state. [\u2026] There will surely never be a solution to human problems by any coercion or force. But there will also never be a solution through unarmed freedom as long as powerful bullies exist who will use force.\"[37]/nGofman was born in Cleveland, Ohio to Jewish parents, David and Sarah Gofman, who immigrated to the US from czarist Russia in about 1905.[38] His father had been \"involved in some of the early revolutionary activities against the Czar.\"[39] Gofman died of heart failure at age 88 on August 15, 2007, in his home in San Francisco.", "55501604": "Prof John Todd Morrison FRSE FRSSA (1863-1944) was a Scottish scientist and meteorologist who lived most of his professional life in South Africa.

The elder brother of the writer Veniamin Kaverin./nZilber was born on March 15 [O.S. March 27][1] 1894 in the family of the kapellmeister Abel Zilber and his wife, n\u00e9e Khana Girshevna (Anna Grigorievna) Desson, pianist and owner of music stores. Place of birth \u2013 the village of Medved, Medved volost, Novgorod Governorate. His sister Leya (married Elena Aleksandrovna Tynyanova, 1892\u20131944) is the wife of the writer and literary critic Yury Tynyanov, a classmate of Lev Zilber. His younger brothers: military doctor David Zilber (1897\u20131967), composer and conductor Alexander Ruchiov (1899\u20131970) and writer Veniamin Kaverin (1902\u20131989)./nIn 1912, Zilber graduated from the Pskov provincial gymnasium with a silver medal and entered the natural department of the Faculty of physics and mathematics of St. Petersburg Imperial University. In 1915 he transferred to the medical faculty of Moscow University, having received permission to attend classes at the natural department at the same time and graduated from it in 1919./nHaving left in 1919 as a volunteer for the front he served in the Red Army in various positions from a doctor to the head of the medical unit. He was taken prisoner by the whites, but successfully escaped. Since 1921, he worked at the Institute of microbiology of the People's Commissariat for Health in Moscow.[2]/nIn 1928 he married with Zinaida Yermolyeva. The first months after the wedding Zilber and Yermolyeva spent working at the Pasteur Institute in France and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany.[3] In 1929, he was sent by the People's Commissar for Health N. Semashko to suppress an outbreak of typhoid fever in the city of Dzerzhinsk near Nizhny Novgorod.[4]/nIn 1929, he accepted an offer to take the position of director of the Azerbaijan Institute of microbiology and head of the department of microbiology at the Medical University in Baku. He led the suppression of an outbreak of plague in the villages of Bulutan and Hadrut in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1930.[5] Upon his return to Baku, he was introduced to the Order of the Red Banner, but was soon arrested on charges of sabotage to infect the population of Azerbaijan with plague. He was released after 4 months (possibly, at the request of Maxim Gorky, who was approached by the younger brother of Lev Zilber, writer Veniamin Kaverin, perhaps due to the efforts of his ex-wife Zinaida Yermolyeva).[6] Upon his release, Zilber worked in Moscow heading the department of microbiology at the Central Institute for the Improvement of Doctors and head of the microbiological department of the State Scientific and Control Institute of the People's Commissariat for Health of the RSFSR named after Lev Tarasevich./nIn 1932, he led the elimination of an outbreak of smallpox in Kazakhstan[4] and in 1935 he also married with Valeria Petrovna Kiseleva./nIn 1935\u20131936 he achieved the creation of the Central Virus Laboratory under the People's Commissariat for Health of the RSFSR and the opening of a department of virology at the Institute of Microbiology of the USSR Academy of Sciences.[4][3]/nIn 1937, he led the Far Eastern expedition of the People's Commissariat for Health of the USSR to study an unknown infectious disease of the central nervous system. During the work of the expedition the nature of the disease \u2013 tick-borne encephalitis was clarified and methods of dealing with it were proposed.[6]/nImmediately upon his return, he was arrested on denunciations of an attempt to infect Moscow with encephalitis and concealment of the fact that encephalitis was brought into the USSR by Japanese saboteurs. In June 1939 he was released. Zilber participated in the struggle for his release. His brother Kaverin, Ermolyeva, colleagues on the Far Eastern expedition A. K. Shubladze, Mikhail Chumakov, V. D. Solovyov and many others participated in the struggle for his release.[4][7]/nIn 1939, he became the head of the virology department at the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology, which he led until his death in 1966 with a break during the third arrest (1940\u20131944).[2]/nIn 1940 Zilber was arrested for the third time. While imprisoned, he served part of his term in camps on the Pechora river, where in the conditions of the tundra he received a yeast preparation against pellagra from the reindeer moss and saved the lives of hundreds of prisoners who died from complete vitamin deficiency. He received a copyright certificate for the invention, the certificate was recorded in the name of the \"NKVD\".[4] He refused repeated offers to work on bacteriological weapons. Remembering Zilber's ability to get alcohol from reindeer moss, the authorities sent him to a chemical \"sharashka\", where he began carcinoma research.[8] For tobacco the prisoners caught mice and rats for Zilber for experiments. In the course of research, he formulated a new concept of the origin of cancerous tumors./nIn March 1944, on the eve of Zilber's 50th birthday, he was released thanks to a letter of innocence addressed to Joseph Stalin[8] and signed by chief surgeon of the Red Army Nikolai Burdenko, Vice President of the USSR Academy of Sciences Leon Orbeli, academician Nikolay Gamaleya, biochemist Vladimir Engelgardt and Zinaida Yermolyeva (the creator of Soviet penicillin and Zilber's ex-wife), who was the initiator of the appeal along with his other colleagues and students.[9][10]/nIn the summer of 1945, he found and took his family to the USSR \u2013 his wife, wife's sister and two sons who survived in German work camps, where they spent 3.5 years. In the same year, he was elected an academician of the newly created USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, appointed scientific director of the Institute of virology of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences and headed the Department of virology and tumor immunology of the Institute of epidemiology, microbiology and infectious diseases of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, where he worked all subsequent years./nHe was occupied with basing and elaborating a viral theory of the origin of cancer. Zilber received the State Prize of the USSR in 1946; in 1967 he was posthumously awarded the State Prize of the USSR for discovering the pathogenicity of the virus of Rous sarcoma of fowl for other classes of animals (cycle of works, 1957\u201366).

He was also the anonymous author of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which was so controversial that his authorship was not acknowledged until after his death.[3]/nChambers was born in Peebles in the Scottish Borders 10 July 1802 to Jean Gibson (c. 1781\u20131843) and James Chambers, a cotton manufacturer. He was their second son of six children.[1] The town had changed little in centuries. The town had old and new parts, each consisting of little more than a single street. Peebles was mainly inhabited by weavers and labourers living in thatched cottages.[4] His father, James Chambers, made his living as a cotton manufacturer. Their slate-roofed house was built by James Chambers' father as a wedding gift for his son, and the ground floor served as the family workshop.[5]/nA small circulating library in the town, run by Alexander Elder, introduced Robert to books and developed his literary interests when he was young. Occasionally his father would buy books for the family library, and one day Robert found a complete set of the fourth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica hidden away in a chest in the attic. He eagerly read this for many years. Near the end of his life, Chambers remembered feeling \"a profound thankfulness that such a convenient collection of human knowledge existed, and that here it was spread out like a well-plenished table before me.\"[6] Robert's older brother, William, later recalled that for Robert, \"the acquisition of knowledge was with him the highest of earthly enjoyments.\"[7]/nRobert was sent to local schools and showed unusual literary taste and ability,[2] though he found his schooling to be uninspiring. His education was typical for the day. The country school, directed by James Gray, taught the boys reading, writing, and, for an additional charge, arithmetic. In grammar school it was the classics\u2014Latin and Ancient Greek, with some English composition. Boys bullied one another and the teacher administered corporal punishment in the classroom for unruly behaviour. Although uninspired by the school, Robert made up for this at the bookseller./nBoth Robert and William were born with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Their parents attempted to correct this abnormality through operations, and while William's was successful Robert was left partially lame. So while other boys roughed it outside, Robert was content to stay indoors and study his books.[8]/nRobert surpassed his elder brother in his education, which he continued for several years beyond William's. Robert had been destined for the ministry, but at the age of fifteen he dropped this intended career. The arrival of the power loom suddenly threatened James Chambers' cotton business, forcing him to close it down and become a draper. During this time, James began to socialise with a number of French prisoners of war on parole who were stationed in Peebles. Unfortunately, James Chambers lent these exiles a large amount of credit, and when they were abruptly transferred away he was forced to declare bankruptcy. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1813. Robert continued his education at the High School,[9] and William became a bookseller's apprentice. In 1818 Robert, at sixteen years old, began his own business as a bookstall-keeper on Leith Walk. At first, his entire stock consisted of some old books belonging to his father, amounting to thirteen feet of shelf space and worth no more than a few pounds. By the end of the first year the value of his stock went up to twelve pounds, and modest success came gradually.[10]/nWhile Robert built up a business, his brother William expanded his own by purchasing a home-made printing press and publishing pamphlets as well as creating his own type. Soon afterwards, Robert and William decided to join forces\u2014with Robert writing and William printing. Their first joint venture was a magazine series called The Kaleidoscope, or Edinburgh Literary Amusement, sold for threepence. This was issued every two weeks between 6 October 1821 and 12 January 1822.[11] It was followed by Illustrations of the Author of Waverley (1822), which offered sketches of individuals believed to have been the inspirations for some of the characters in Walter Scott's works of fiction.[12] The last book to be printed on William's old press was Traditions of Edinburgh (1824), derived from Robert's enthusiastic interest in the history and antiquities of Edinburgh. He followed this with Walks in Edinburgh (1825), Popular Rhymes of Scotland (1826) and Picture of Scotland (1826). This was followed by five volumes of Scottish history to form part of Constable's Miscellany. In 1832 he compiled Gazetteer of Scotland.[13]/nThese books gained him the approval and personal friendship of Walter Scott. After Scott's death, Robert paid tribute to him by writing a Life of Sir Walter Scott (1832). Robert also wrote a History of the Rebellions in Scotland from 1638 to 1745 (5 vols, 1828) and numerous other works on Scotland and Scottish traditions./nOn 7 December 1829 Robert married Anne Kirkwood, the only child of Jane and John Kirkwood.[14] Together they had 14\u00a0children, three of whom died in infancy. Excluding these three, their children were Robert (Robert Chambers Jr.), Nina (Mrs. Frederick Lehmann, and mother of Rudolf Chambers Lehmann), Mary (Mrs. Alexander Mackenzie Edwards, mother of satirist Bob Edwards), Anne (Mrs. Dowie, mother of M\u00e9nie Muriel Dowie), Janet, Eliza (Mrs. William Overend Priestley), Amelia (Mrs. Rudolf Lehmann), James, William, Phoebe (Mrs. Zeigler), and Alice.[15]/nAt the beginning of 1832 Robert's brother William Chambers started a weekly publication entitled Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, which speedily gained a large circulation. Robert was at first only a contributor, but after 14\u00a0volumes had appeared, he became joint editor with his brother, and his collaboration contributed more perhaps than anything else to the success of the Journal. The two brothers eventually united as partners in the book publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers Publishers.[16]/nAt the same time Robert ran a bookshop and circulating library from 48 Hanover Street with his younger brother, James Chambers. Meanwhile, William ran his shop from 47 Broughton Street. Robert at this time was living close to the shop, at 27 Elder Street[17] (demolished in the 1960s to improve access to Edinburgh Bus Station)./nAmong the other numerous works of which Robert was in whole or in part the author, the Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen[18] (4 vols., Glasgow, 1832\u20131835), the Cyclop\u00e6dia of English Literature (1844), the Life and Works of Robert Burns (4 vols., 1851), Ancient Sea Margins (1848), the Domestic Annals of Scotland (1859\u20131861) and the Book of Days (2 vols., 1862\u20131864) were the most important.[19]/nChambers's Encyclopaedia (1859\u20131868), with Dr Andrew Findlater as editor, was carried out under the superintendence of the brothers. The Cyclop\u00e6dia of English Literature contains a series of admirably selected extracts from the best authors of every period, \"set in a biographical and critical history of the literature itself.\" For the Life of Burns he made diligent and laborious original investigations, gathering many hitherto unrecorded facts from the poet's sister, Mrs Begg, to whose benefit the whole profits of the work were generously devoted.[20][3]/nDuring the 1830s, Robert Chambers took a particularly keen interest in the then rapidly expanding field of geology, and he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1844. Prior to this, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1840, which connected him through correspondence to numerous scientific men. William later recalls that \"His mind had become occupied with speculative theories which brought him into communication with Sir Charles Bell, George Combe, his brother Dr. Andrew Combe, Dr. Neil Arnott, Professor Edward Forbes, Dr. Samuel Brown, and other thinkers on physiology and mental philosophy.\"[21] In 1848 Chambers published his first geological book on Ancient Sea Margins. Later, he toured Scandinavia and Canada for the purpose of geological exploration. The results of his travels were published in Tracings of the North of Europe (1851) and Tracings in Iceland and the Faroe Islands (1856).[3]/nHowever, his most popular book, influenced by his geological studies and interest in speculative theories, was a work to which he never openly attached his name. In 1844, Chambers completed the dictation of his Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation to his wife, Anne Kirkwood, as he recuperated from depression at his holiday home in St Andrews. The composition of Vestiges may have served a therapeutic purpose. Chambers had been an enthusiastic phrenologist in Edinburgh in the 1830s, and the anonymously authored Vestiges became an international bestseller and a powerful public influence, subsequent to Combe's Constitution of Man (1828), and anticipating the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859. In a strange parallel to Robert and Anne Chambers, Prince Albert read the Vestiges aloud to Queen Victoria over several days in 1845.[citation needed] The first edition of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was released in 1844 and published anonymously.[22] Literary anonymity was not uncommon at the time, especially in periodical journalism. However, in the science genre, anonymity was especially rare, due to the fact that science writers typically wanted to take credit for their work to claim priority for their findings./nThe reason for Chambers' anonymity was clear enough as soon as one began reading the text. The book was arguing for a developmental view of the cosmos combining stellar evolution with progressive transmutation of species in the same spirit as the late Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck had been discredited among intellectuals by this time, and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among political radicals, and materialists. Chambers, however, tried to explicitly distance his own theory from that of Lamarck's by denying Lamarck's evolutionary mechanism any plausibility. \"Now it is possible that wants and the exercise of faculties have entered in some manner into the production of the phenomena which we have been considering; but certainly not in the way suggested by Lamarck, whose whole notion is obviously so inadequate to account for the rise of the organic kingdoms, that we only can place it with pity among the follies of the wise.\"[23] Additionally, his work was far more sweeping in scope than any of his predecessors. \"The book, as far as I am aware,\" he writes in his concluding chapter, \"is the first attempt to connect the natural sciences in a history of creation.\"[24]/nRobert Chambers was certainly aware of the storm that would probably be raised at the time by his treatment of the subject, and most importantly he did not wish to get his and his brother's publishing firm involved in any kind of scandal that could potentially ruin or severely impact their business venture. The arrangements for publication, therefore, were made through a friend named Alexander Ireland, of Manchester.[3] To further prevent the possibility of any unwanted revelations, Chambers only disclosed the secret to four people: his wife, his brother William, Ireland, and George Combe's nephew, Robert Cox.[25] All correspondence to and from Chambers passed through Ireland's hands first, and all letters and manuscripts were dutifully transcribed in Mrs. Chamber's hand to prevent the possibility of anyone recognizing Robert's handwriting./nBy implying that God might not actively sustain the natural and social hierarchies, the book threatened the social order and could provide ammunition to Chartists and revolutionaries. Anglican clergymen and naturalists attacked the book, with the geologist Adam Sedgwick predicting \"ruin and confusion in such a creed\" which, if taken up by the working classes, \"will undermine the whole moral and social fabric\" bringing \"discord and deadly mischief in its train\". The book was liked by many Quakers and Unitarians. The Unitarian physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter called it \"a very beautiful and a very interesting book\", and helped Chambers with correcting later editions. Critics thanked God that the author began \"in ignorance and presumption\", for the revised versions \"would have been much more dangerous\". Nevertheless, the book caused a sensation and quickly went through a number of new editions. Vestiges brought widespread discussion of evolution out of the streets and gutter presses and into the drawing rooms of respectable men and women./nChambers gave a talk on ancient beaches at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Oxford in May 1847. An observer named Andrew Crombie Ramsay at the meeting reported that Chambers \"pushed his conclusions to a most unwarrantable length and got roughly handled on account of it by Buckland, De la Beche, Sedgwick, Murchison, and Lyell. The last told me afterwards that he did so purposely that [Chambers] might see that reasonings in the style of the author of the Vestiges would not be tolerated among scientific men.\" On the Sunday Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, used his sermon at St. Mary's Church on \"the wrong way of doing science\" to deliver a stinging attack obviously aimed at Chambers. The church, \"crowded to suffocation\" with geologists, astronomers and zoologists, heard jibes about the \"half-learned\" seduced by the \"foul temptation\" of speculation looking for a self-sustaining universe in a \"mocking spirit of unbelief\", showing a failure to understand the \"modes of the Creator's acting\" or to meet the responsibilities of a gentleman. Chambers denounced this as an attempt to stifle progressive opinion, but others thought he must have gone home \"with the feeling of a martyr\"./nNear the close of autumn 1848, Chambers allowed himself to be brought forward as a candidate for the administrative position of Lord Provost of Edinburgh. The timing was especially poor, with others seeking any means possible to try and discredit his character. His adversaries found the perfect opportunity to do so in the swirling allegations that he was the author of the much reviled Vestiges. William Chambers, in his Memoir of Robert Chambers, still sworn to secrecy despite his brother's recent passing, makes his only mention of Vestiges in connection with this affair: \"(Robert) might have been well assured that a rumor to the effect that he was the author of 'Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation' would be used to his disadvantage, and that anything he might say on the subject would be unavailing.\"[26] Robert withdrew his candidacy in disgust./nIn 1851 Chambers was one of a group of writers who joined the publisher John Chapman in reinvigorating the Westminster Review as a flagship of free thought and reform, spreading the ideas of evolutionism./nRobert Chambers was a golfer and was elected an honorary member of the Musselburgh Golf Club (now Royal Musselburgh Golf Club) on 14 September 1833.[27] His son, who followed him into the publishing business, was a renowned player and became Champion Golfer in 1858 as a member of Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society.[28]/nThe Book of Days was Chambers's last major publication, and perhaps his most elaborate. It was a miscellany of popular antiquities in connection with the calendar, and it is supposed that his excessive labour in connexion with this book hastened his death. Two years before, the University of St Andrews had conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, and he was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club in London.[3]/nRobert Chambers died on 17 March 1871 in St Andrews. He was buried in the Cathedral burial ground in the interior of the old Church of St. Regulus, according to his wishes.[29] The grave lies against the southern wall of the structure attaching the roofless section, east of the tower. A memorial window was also erected to Robert by his brother William in St Giles Cathedral next to a larger window to William himself, placed at the time of his restoration of the cathedral. The pair of windows lie in the northern transept./nA year after Robert's death, his brother William published a biography under the title Memoir of Robert Chambers; With Autobiographical Reminiscences of William Chambers. However, the book did not reveal Robert's authorship of the Vestiges. Milton Millhauser, in his 1959 book Just Before Darwin, wrote the following about William's memoir: \"The fraternal Memoir of Robert Chambers might have been an excellent biography had not the author been concerned to keep the Vestiges secret and one or two others. Despite the author's intelligence and sympathy, such omissions inevitably produced a distorted picture\" (p.\u00a0191, note 7). The book contains some reminiscences by Robert of his early life, with the rest of the narration filled in by William./nAlexander Ireland, in 1884, issued a 12th edition of Vestiges with Robert Chambers finally listed as the author and a preface giving an account of its authorship. Ireland felt that there was no longer any reason for concealing the author's name.[3]", "38167400": "Sir Ian Lamont Boyd, FRSE, FRSB, FRS (born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish zoologist, environmental and polar scientist, former Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)[2] and is a professor of biology at the University of St Andrews.

Defra was originally formed from the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and part of the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions both of which had Chief Scientific Advisers up until the merger./nHis appointment was non-political, but he served as scientific adviser to four different Secretaries of State including Owen Paterson, Liz Truss, Andrea Leadsom and Michael Gove./nIan Boyd has published over 180 peer reviewed scientific papers (H-index 52), 14 books and has been the author/co-author/editor of several major reports including a marine atlas of Scotland's coastal seas.[8] He has been an author of a number of publications about fisheries management both in connection with his native Scotland[9][10] and globally.[11]/nHis most significant discovery has been the functional relationship between the performance of marine predators and the state of their food supply, first published in a paper in the Journal of Animal Ecology in 2001.[12] This suggested that there was likely to be a surplus of marine production which could be exploited by fisheries before there were wider effects on marine ecosystems. Although Boyd had made this discovery in the krill-based ecosystems of the Southern Ocean, together with colleagues, he showed that this relationship was general for most marine ecosystems. They published a paper in the journal Science[13] making the point that fisheries needed to leave at least one-third of the biomass in the ocean for other predators like seabirds./nMuch of his research has focused on the studying the ecological economics of marine predators, mostly in Antarctica, and using their energy balances and behavioral and physiological responses to understand the distribution and abundance of marine resources.[13][14] He has developed methods of using heart rate as a proxy for measuring metabolic rates in free-ranging animals.[15][16][17][18] He then used these results to estimate the food consumption of whole populations of marine predators like seals and penguins.[19] Other interests have included behavioral optimisation within physiological constraints using diving physiology as an example[20][21] and the evolution of the economy of natural currency (e.g. energy) allocation under uncertainty.[22][23][24][25]/nHe has also authored many research papers and books about marine mammals.[26] He has studied controversial issues in marine environmental science including the interactions between marine mammals and fisheries in the Northern Gulf of Alaska[27] and the effects of anthropogenic noise on marine organisms.[28][29]/nTogether with his father, John Morton Boyd, he has written several books about the natural history of the Hebrides include one published in the Collins New Naturalist series.[30]/nIn a 2017 article in the journal Science, \"Toward pesticidovigilance\", he called for a new approach to the regulation of pesticides[31][32] and he made further reference to pesticides in an explanation for the decision made by the UK government in April 2018 to support further restriction by the EU on neonicotinoid pesticides.[33] He also published a recent article in Nature, \"Taking the long view\", which advocated taking a systems approach to understanding the problems which governments have to manage.[34]/nIn 2015, he wrote an oped in the New York Times titled \"Our deadened, carbon soaked seas\"[35] with Rick Spinrad who was then the Chief Scientist at NOAA to draw attention to the dangers of ocean acidification. Also in 2015, he wrote an article on environmental forensics[36] where he said \"We breathe, eat and drink other people's pollution. The 'tragedy of the commons' has a powerful presence across the environment. It has proved difficult to design market solutions to deal with these issues of equity.\"/nWith co-author Sir Mark Walport he produced a report in 2017 on waste and resource productivity.[37] When giving evidence to the UK Parliamentary Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee he said that it would be sensible to \"bury plastic in landfill until science progresses\" and that plastic waste should be stored in landfill sites until it can be mined.[38][39] In 2018, also with Sir Mark Walport, he co-edited a UK Government Foresight report[40] on the Future of the Sea.[41]/nHe has also provided commentary on the use of data in government saying \"Across government there may be just about as many definitions of data as there are people\".[42]/nHe also joined the UK's COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies SAGE in late April 2020 and took part in its meetings until August 2021. In August 2022, he wrote an opinion piece in The Observer defending the way science advice was provided during the pandemic.[43]/nHe is Chair of the UK Research Integrity Office and is a Trustee of the UK's National Oceanography Centre and the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

Until 2023, the trust owns the Treshnish Isleas in the Hebrides and has renovated the Skerryvore lighthouse supply station at Hynish on the island of Tiree to create an outdoor centre, holiday accommodation and affordable housing.[44]/nIn July 2013, Boyd opined that \"the scientific community needs to [be] avoiding suggesting that policies are either right or wrong; and being willing to make the voice of science heard by engaging with the mechanisms already available through science advisory committees, by working with embedded advisers (such as myself), and by being the voice of reason, rather than dissent, in the public arena.\"[45] The sentiment is seen as controversial by such people as Naomi Klein[46] and George Monbiot, the latter of which described the opinion as \"Shut up, speak through me, don't dissent \u2013 or your behaviour will ensure that science becomes irrelevant.\"[47][48]/nIn October 2013, Professor Boyd rebutted these opinions by Naomi Klein and George Monbiot.[49] Boyd stated that the point he was making in July was that \"it is not their (scientists) job to make politicians' decisions for them \u2013 when scientists start providing opinions about whether policies are right or wrong they risk becoming politicised. A politicised scientist cannot also be an independent scientist.\"/nHe was Chief Scientific Adviser at Defra through a period of controversy and change. Following the invasion of ash disease in to the UK in 2012, caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, he wrote a review of the effects of tree disease on ecosystems[50] and he also responded to criticism of some of Defra's methods used in badger culling.[51] In 2013, he called for higher standards in policy-relevant science.[52]/nIn 2007 and 2008, he was Chief Scientist for the US Navy Behavioral Response Study which examined the responses of whales to naval anti-submarine sonar.[53] This contributed to the case of Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council in the US Supreme Court./nBoyd has received numerous honours and awards recognising his contributions to science, including the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the W. S. Bruce Medal for his research in Polar Science and has been elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE) and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology (FRSB).[54] He has held an honorary professorship at the University of Birmingham and was awarded the Antarctic Service Medal of the United States in 1995.

King initially worked in the Diphtheria Laboratory but, in 1951, transferred to the newly created General Bacteriology Laboratory, which was established to study malaria and exotic diseases brought back by servicemen in World War II.[1] Her time in the General Bacteriology Laboratory sparked an interest in disease causing gram-negative bacillus bacteria that did not belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Her experience working in hospital laboratories made her aware of the challenges these poorly classified bacteria presented in a diagnostic setting, and she set out to organize these classifications.[1]/nKing worked in the General Bacteriology Laboratory until her death in 1966.[1]/nIn 1959, King identified a strain of bacilli bacteria that was responsible for an outbreak of meningitis among hospital newborns.[3] She gave the species the name Flavobacterium meningosepticum and linked it as the source of infection in the newborns. She reported her findings in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology with her paper Studies on a Group of Previously Unclassified Bacteria Associated with Meningitis in Infants.[4] In 1994 the species was reclassified as belonging to the Chryseobacterium genus. The species was reclassified again in 2005, this time, as part of a new genus of bacteria named Elizabethkingia in her honor.[5] Species of this genus are responsible for meningitis infections in newborns and meningitis, bloodstream, and respiratory infections in people with compromised immune systems.[6] Today the species first identified by King in 1959 is known as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica./nKing specialized in systematic identification of bacteria using known cultures collected from around the world, and she propagated, froze, and stored bacterial samples for future use in identification. The information from her collection was stored on laboratory data cards developed with Dr. Martha K. Ward.

In the 'White Terror' of 1920\u201321 he was imprisoned for 13 months for alleged statements against Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy. While in prison, he worked on his four volume work Die Flora der Juden (\u201cThe Flora of the Jews\u201d), on terminology of plants in Jewish sources./nLike his father, L\u00f6w was a great preacher in the Hungarian language, and several hundred of his sermons were published in four volumes between 1900 and 1939. On the occasion of his congregation's centenary he published (with Z. Kulinyi) the congregation's history (1885) and that of its \u1e25evra kaddisha (with S. Klein, 1887). In 1883 he published a prayer book (in Hungarian) for women, and rendered the Song of Songs and some psalms into the same language./nFrom 1927 he represented the Neolog (non-Orthodox) communities in the upper chamber of the Hungarian parliament and also was a member of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.

In Budapest, however, he was freed by Zionist workers. He died that year in Budapest./nL\u00f6w\u2019s fame as a scholar is based primarily on his pioneering work in the field of Talmud and rabbinic lexicography and in the study of plant names. This special interest is apparent in his doctoral thesis \"Aram\u00e4ische Pflanzennamen\" (\"Aramaic Plant Names\") (1879) as well as in \"Meleagros aus Gadara und die Flora Aramaea\" (1883). L\u00f6w systematically explored the basics of plant terminology in different periods of the Hebrew and Aramaic languages, dominated the latest scientific methods in this field, made himself familiar with literary sources of plant names, and made careful use of manuscript material.  With the help of Semitic languages, especially Syriac, he clarified many etymologies. He had great influence on future scholars, particularly Yehuda Feliks, who considered him one of the greatest scholars of Jewish botany./nL\u00f6w contributed to Wilhelm Gesenius' famous Bible dictionary (10th ed., 1886; 11th ed., 1890), and to Carl Brockelmann's \"Lexicon syriacum\" (1895).

He also contributed to the study of ancient Mesoamerican linguistics, in addition to work he had already completed in Europe./nRafinesque was an eccentric and erratic genius.[1] He was an autodidact, who excelled in various fields of knowledge, as a zoologist, botanist, writer and polyglot. He wrote prolifically on such diverse topics as anthropology, biology, geology, and linguistics, but was honored in none of these fields during his lifetime. Indeed, he was an outcast in the American scientific community and his submissions were automatically rejected by leading journals. Among his theories were that ancestors of Native Americans had migrated by the Bering Sea from Asia to North America,[2][3] and that the Americas were populated by black indigenous peoples at the time of European contact.[4]/nRafinesque was born on 22 October 1783,[5] in Galata, a suburb of Constantinople.[6][7] His father, F. G. Rafinesque, was a French merchant from Marseilles; his mother, M. Schmaltz, was of German descent and born in Constantinople.[6] His father died in Philadelphia about 1793.[8] Rafinesque spent his youth in Marseilles,[6] and was mostly self-educated; he never attended university.[9][10] By the age of 12, he had begun collecting plants for an herbarium.[11] By 14, he had taught himself Greek and Latin because he needed to follow footnotes in the books he was reading in his paternal grandmother's libraries. In 1802, at the age of 19, Rafinesque sailed to Philadelphia in the United States with his younger brother. They traveled through Pennsylvania and Delaware,[7] where he made the acquaintance of most of the young nation's few botanists.[12]/nIn 1805, Rafinesque returned to Europe with his collection of botanical specimens, and settled in Palermo, Sicily, where he learned Italian.[7][13] He became so successful in trade that he retired by age 25 and devoted his time entirely to natural history. For a time Rafinesque also worked as secretary to the American consul.[13] During his stay in Sicily, he studied plants and fishes,[5] naming many newly discovered species of each. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1808.[14]/nRafinesque had a common-law wife. After their son died in 1815, he left her and returned to the United States. When his ship Union foundered near the coast of Connecticut, he lost all his books (50 boxes) and all his specimens (including more than 60,000 shells).[15] Settling in New York, Rafinesque became a founding member of the newly established Lyceum of Natural History.[16] In 1817, his book Florula Ludoviciana\u00a0[es] or A Flora of the State of Louisiana was strongly criticized by fellow botanists, which caused his writings to be ignored. By 1818, he had collected and named more than 250 new species of plants and animals. Slowly, he was rebuilding his collection of objects from nature.[citation needed]/nIn the summer of 1818, in Henderson, Kentucky, Rafinesque made the acquaintance of  fellow naturalist John James Audubon, and stayed in Audubon's home for some three weeks. Audubon, although enjoying Rafinesque's company, took advantage of him by practical jokes involving fantastic, made-up species.[17]/nIn 1819, Rafinesque became professor of botany at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where he also gave private lessons in French, Italian, and Spanish.[18] He was loosely associated with John D. Clifford, a merchant who was also interested in the ancient earthworks that remained throughout the Ohio Valley. Clifford conducted archival research, seeking the origins of these mounds, and Rafinesque measured and mapped them. Some had already been lost to American development.[citation needed]/nHe was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820.[19]/nRafinesque started recording all the new species of plants and animals he encountered in travels throughout the state. He was considered an erratic student of higher plants. In the spring of 1826, he left the university[20] after quarreling with its president.[citation needed]/nHe traveled and lectured in various places, and endeavored to establish a magazine and a botanic garden, but without success. He moved to Philadelphia, a center of publishing and research, without employment. He published The Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge, a Cyclop\u00e6dic Journal and Review,[21] of which only eight issues were printed (1832\u20131833). He also gave public lectures and continued publishing, mostly at his own expense.[citation needed]/nRafinesque died of stomach and liver cancer in Philadelphia on 18 September 1840.[22] The cancer may have been induced by Rafinesque's self-medication years before with a mixture containing maidenhair fern.[23] He was buried in a plot in what is now Ronaldson's Cemetery.[22] In March 1924, what were thought to be his remains were transported to Transylvania University and reinterred in a tomb under a stone inscribed, \"Honor to whom honor is overdue.\"[24][25]/nRafinesque published 6,700 binomial names of plants, many of which have priority over more familiar names.[26] The quantity of new taxa he produced, both plants and animals, has made Rafinesque memorable or even notorious among biologists.[27][28]/nRafinesque applied to join the Lewis and Clark Expedition, but was twice turned down by Thomas Jefferson.[29] After studying the specimens collected by the expedition, he assigned scientific names to the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), and the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus'\u2019).[citation needed]/nRafinesque was one of the first to use the term \"evolution\" in the context of biological speciation.[30]/nRafinesque proposed a theory of evolution before Charles Darwin.[31][32] In a letter in 1832, Rafinesque wrote:/nThe truth is that Species and perhaps Genera also, are forming in organized beings by gradual deviations of shapes, forms and organs, taking place in the lapse of time. There is a tendency to deviations and mutations through plants and animals by gradual steps at remote irregular periods. This is a part of the great universal law of perpetual mutability in everything. Thus it is needless to dispute and differ about new genera, species and varieties. Every variety is a deviation which becomes a species as soon as it is permanent by reproduction. Deviations in essential organs may thus gradually become new genera.[33]/nIn the third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch that acknowledged the ideas of Rafinesque.[34][35]/nRafinesque's evolutionary theory appears in a two-page article in the 1833 spring issue of the Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge (a journal founded by himself).[36] Rafinesque held that species are not fixed; they gradually change through time. He used the term \"mutations\". He believed that evolution had occurred \"by gradual steps at remote irregular periods.\" This has been compared to the concept of punctuated equilibrium.[37] He also held that the same processes apply to humans.[38]/nIn 1836, Rafinesque published his first volume of The American Nations. This included Walam Olum, a purported migration and creation narrative of the Lenape (also known by English speakers as the Delaware Indians). It told of their migration to the lands around the Delaware River. Rafinesque claimed he had obtained wooden tablets engraved and painted with indigenous pictographs, together with a transcription in the Lenape language. Based on this, he produced an English translation of the tablets' contents. Rafinesque claimed the original tablets and transcription were later lost, leaving his notes and transcribed copy as the only record of evidence.[citation needed]/nFor over a century after Rafinesque's publication, the Walam Olum was widely accepted by ethnohistorians as authentically Native American in origin, but as early as 1849, when the document was republished by Ephraim G. Squier, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, an ethnologist who had worked extensively in Michigan and related territories, wrote to Squier saying that he believed the document might be fraudulent.[39] In the 1950s, the Indiana Historical Society published a \"retranslation\" of the Walam Olum, as \"a worthy subject for students of aboriginal culture\".[40]/nSince the late 20th century, studies especially in linguistic, ethnohistorical, archaeological, and textual analyses suggest that the Walam Olum account was largely or entirely a fabrication. Scholars have described its record of \"authentic Lenape traditional migration stories\" as spurious.[41] After the publication in 1995 of David Oestreicher's thesis, The Anatomy of the Walam Olum: A 19th Century Anthropological Hoax, many scholars concurred with his analysis. They concluded that Rafinesque had been either the perpetrator, or perhaps the victim, of a hoax.[41] Other scholars, writers, and some among the Lenape continue to find the account plausible and support its authenticity.[41]/nRafinesque made a notable contribution to North American prehistory with his studies of ancient earthworks of the Adena and Hopewell cultures, especially in the Ohio Valley. He was the first to identify these as the \"Ancient Monuments of America\". He listed more than 500 such archaeological sites in Ohio and Kentucky.[42] Rafinesque never excavated;[43] rather, he recorded the sites visited by careful measurements, sketches, and written descriptions. Only a few of his descriptions were published, with his friend John D. Clifford's series \"Indian Antiquities\", eight long letters in Lexington's short-lived Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine (1819\u20131820).[44] Clifford died suddenly in 1820, ending his contributions.[citation needed]/nRafinesque's work was used by others. For instance, he identified 148 ancient earthworks sites in Kentucky. All sites in Kentucky that were included by E. G. Squier and Davis in their notable Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley (1848), completed for the Smithsonian Institution, were first identified by Rafinesque in his manuscripts.[45]/nRafinesque also made contributions to Mesoamerican studies. The latter were based on linguistic data, which he extracted from printed sources, mostly those of travelers. He designated as Taino, the ancient language of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.[46] Others later also used the term to identify the ethnicity of indigenous Caribbean peoples.[citation needed]/nAlthough mistaken in his presumption that the ancient Maya script was alphabetical in nature, Rafinesque was probably first to insist that studying modern Mayan languages could lead to deciphering the ancient script. In 1832, he was the first to partly decipher ancient Maya. He explained that its bar-and-dot symbols represent fives and ones, respectively.[47][48][49]/nAccording to historian George Daniels, Rafinesque was a brilliant but erratic naturalist who roamed the American wilderness. His style was offputting to the emerging professionalization of science and achievements were controversial at the time and by historians ever since. By 1820 he was virtually an outcast in the scientific community as all the important publications rejected his submissions. The two leading American scientists of the day Benjamin Silliman and Asa Gray were harshly critical. Modern historians agree that Rafinesque was often hasty, and tried to claim credit properly due to other researchers. Scientists were troubled that his theory of evolution \u2013 long before Darwin \u2013 seemed to be based more on his speculation and exaggerations than on solid research. Despite all his faults, says Daniels, \"he made enormous contributions to the natural history phase of American science...with the establishment of 34 genera and 24 species of American fishes.\" He was also a brilliant teacher at Transylvania University.[50]/nJohn Jeremiah Sullivan's essay La-Hwi-Ne-Ski: Career of an Eccentric Naturalist, which appears in his 2011 collection, Pulphead, chronicles the life and times of Rafinesque.", "34661320": "\u00c9douard Dujardin-Beaumetz (1868 \u2013 27 October 1947) was a French biologist and physician.

Moore[1] is an American aquatic ecologist, whose area of expertise is the threat posed to lakes from manmade origins. She was awarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef Award for Excellence in Education in 2015 for an innovative teaching program she designed which combines cultural and scientific research to give students an interdisciplinary understanding of the impact of changes in lake habitat to organisms in the water, as well as the people who populate the shores surrounding the lake./nMarianne Voigt Moore, daughter of Marjorie and Max Moore and named after the poet Marianne Moore, was raised on her family farm in Mediapolis, Iowa.[2][3] From an early age, she had a fascination with animals and insects. After completing her primary education and graduating from Mediapolis High School, she enrolled in Colorado College.[2][4] During her second year of schooling, she participated in a summer research class on aquatic invertebrate zoology and became interested in the microorganisms which populated the lake on the Minnesota-Canada border, where the research facility was located.[2] Completing her bachelor's degree, cum laude, in biology in 1975,[2][5] she went on to work on a master's degree at Iowa State University. Under the tutelage of Roger W. Bachmann, Moore studied the effects of bi-products from a nearby meat processing plant on the Iowa River and earned her degree in limnology in 1977.[2] That year, winning a Fulbright-Hays fellowship, she began her doctoral research studying zooplankton in freshwater lakes in New Zealand at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch.[4]/nReturning from her year abroad, Moore worked as a research assistant to Bachmann at Iowa State University,[2] completing a survey of 115 of the public lakes in the state. The study became the baseline for lake restoration projects in Iowa.[6] The following year, she went to Hanover, New Hampshire and began work on her PhD at Dartmouth College,[2] where she also worked as a teaching assistant.[3] She completed her dissertation in 1986, under John J. Gilbert, graduating with her doctorate in aquatic ecology in 1986.[2] From 1986 to 1988, Moore worked at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, as a research fellow and instructor.[2][3]/nIn 1988, Moore was hired as an assistant professor at Wellesley College in the biology department,[3] moving to Wellesley, Massachusetts with her husband, Nick Rodenhouse, who was also accepted to teach at Wellesley. While he researched migratory birds and the effects of climate change upon them, Moore continued her research into zooplankton, studying nearby Lake Waban.[7] Her research encompassed analyzing the effect of light pollution on lake organisms.[8] In 1995, Moore met Thomas Hodge, a professor of Russian, and they conceived of an idea to develop a cross-cultural, interdisciplinary research program which would combine humanities students' cultural studies with biology students' research activities focused on Lake Baikal in Siberia.[7] In 1997, Moore became an associate professor[2] and three years later, she and Hodge drew up a syllabus for their course proposal.[7] She received the Anna and Samuel Pinanski Prize for teaching excellence from Wellesley in 1998 and the following year was honored with the Apgar Award for Innovation in Teaching.[9]/nIn 2000, Moore and Hodge went to Lake Baikal and discovered that Irkutsk State University owned a small derelict research station in the village of Bolshiye Koty. With plans for a Russian team to rehabilitate the building, the duo prepared their course and took the first students to the site in 2001. At that time, she heard about a data record which had been kept on the lake water for around sixty years,[7] but thinking there had been an error in translation, she ignored the report. Two years later, when she and student returned to the site, she learned that Mikhail M. Kozhov began collecting weekly samples from the lake in 1945. Later assisted by his daughter, Olga M. Kozhova and granddaughter, Lyubov Izmest'eva, the data had been collected in a year-round effort. Moore made contact with Stephanie E. Hampton,[10] a colleague working at the University of Idaho.[7] Hampton arranged for the University of California, Santa Barbara\u2019s National Center for Ecological Analysis, to assist with analyzing the data on the World Heritage Site and finance the collaborative work.[10] Surmounting logistical, language and cultural challenges, the team produced unique findings on the warming of the lake and the changes in species which inhabit the lake due to increased temperatures.[7]/nExpanding the program in 2011 with a grant from the National Science Foundation, scientists from Irkutsk State University began working with fifteen US scientists from five universities.[7] The goal of the expanded project is to determine if native plankton species in the lake will adapt and thrive with climatic change, or whether warm-water species will replace them, recognizing that shifts in the plankton will impact higher species which feed from plankton and ultimately the entire ecosystem of the lake.[9] Though Moore headed the team which evaluated zooplankton, she was also involved in analyzing[7] \"the world's only exclusively freshwater seal\", pusa sibirica. When she and her graduate student, Ted Ozersky, discovered a collection of 400 seal skulls in a lab in Irkutsk, which had been collected since the 1960s, they sought permission to study them. Extracting teeth and analyzing the metal content with a mass spectrometer they discovered high levels of mercury and cadmium had jeopardized the health of the seals in the 1960s and 1970s.[7] Endangering the seals, which are a primary food source for the indigenous Buryats, with toxic emissions from coal combustion, mining, and nuclear testing posed risks to the health of the entire food chain in and along the lake.[7][11]/nIn 2012, Moore became a full professor at Wellesley and in 2014 was named the Camilla Chandler Frost Professor of Environmental Studies.[12] Along with her students, she has studied algae growth along the coastline of the lake to determine the origin of nutrients for the algae. Initial studies determined that sewage in the streams feeding the lake were not a significant contributor, but later studies indicate that groundwater may be the source.[7] In 2015, Moore was honored by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, who conferred upon her their Ram\u00f3n Margalef Award for Excellence in Education, for her development of the interdisciplinary, multi-institutional and multinational research project at Lake Baikal, which has allowed students learn research techniques while simultaneously developing their ability to critically analyze and create solutions for logistical problems, cultural sensitivity, and language obstacles.[9] Moore retired from Wellesley in 2017.[7]", "16966620": "Carl Fredrik Christoffer Schander (21 May 1960 \u2013 21 February 2012) was a professor in marine biology at the University of Bergen, Norway.

He became the Division Director in 1975 and organized a multidisciplinary research program,[14] which became one of the nation's major federally sponsored research groups in reproductive toxicology. For the next five years, he directed the teratology and developmental toxicology research programs of the National Toxicology Program (NTP), which focused on biochemical and physiological causes of birth defects, pharmacokinetics, postnatal functional evaluations, and mechanistic studies. While at NCTR, Holson also was instrumental in developing the FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and organized and wrote the first FDA training program for GLP inspectors./nDuring his tenure at NCTR, he also served as Assistant Professor of Physiology in the Interdisciplinary Toxicology Training Program at the University of Arkansas School of Medicine in Little Rock, Arkansas. In this capacity, he developed and taught the first graduate-level regulatory toxicology course in the country, served on PhD student committees, and was a member of the admissions committee and policy council./nDr. Holson joined Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) in La Jolla, California during March 1980 to establish research and development and chemical testing programs in toxicology.

From 1980-1986, he also served as a member of the Board of Directors and Secretary for the San Diego Biomedical Research Institute./nIn March 1987, Dr. Holson was appointed Vice President and Director of Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology at WIL Research Laboratories, Inc., in Ashland, Ohio. In August 1988, he was promoted to President and Director of WIL Research. During the next 20 years, he was responsible for all fiduciary and scientific aspects of the company\u2019s operations.[15] He remained scientifically active by serving as a study director upon special request, selectively reviewing data and reports, advising sponsors regarding toxicologic and product development issues, serving as a consultant to federal agencies, publishing scientific papers, giving presentations to various community and scientific organizations, and lecturing at Ashland University.

This success was attributed to the internationally recognized scientific prowess of WIL's staff, the company's study director-centric business model (which viewed each study director as an individual business unit with scientific, project management, and marketing responsibilities), and internally developed innovations such as the industry's first protocol-driven toxicology data management software system.[16] Holson emphasized direct scientist-to-scientist interaction as much as possible across the entire scope of each project, which gained WIL Research numerous accolades from its clients.[17]/nAfter nearly two decades of sustained organic growth, Holson led WIL Research through a period of private capital-financed expansion, beginning with a management buyout (in partnership with Behrman Capital[18]) and formation of a holding company (WRH) in 2004. The expansion continued with acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe,[19] culminating in the $500 million sale of WRH to American Capital, Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACAS) in 2007. After the sale to ACAS, he served as Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the global entity while continuing to serve as President and Director of WIL Research Laboratories in Ashland, Ohio until his retirement from active management duties in November 2008. He served on the Board of Directors of WRH from its inception in 2004 until February 2009./nJoe Holson's research career has spanned a diverse range of test agents using a variety of experimental animal models and human studies.  Building upon the foundational principles of teratology expounded upon by his doctoral advisor, James G. Wilson, his work has emphasized comparative and holistic approaches to problem-solving in the field of developmental and reproductive toxicology. These approaches included extensive collaboration between experimental toxicologists and epidemiologists, advancements in experimental design (e.g., use of replicates and unbalanced study designs) and biostatistics (e.g., use of statistical power calculations), and robust assessments of reliability and animal-human concordance of experimental toxicity findings.[8]/nEarly in Holson's career, while at NCTR, he led studies that assessed the developmental toxicity of FD&C Red No. 2,[20][21][22] an amaranth dye, and the herbicide 2,4,5\u2010T (a component of Agent Orange).[23][24][25] The FD&C Red No. 2 study was a multi-laboratory collaborative effort between industry, U.S. FDA, and NCTR, while the 2,4,5-T study was a large-scale multireplicated study in various strains/stocks of mice that included replicated test groups, at least four dose levels per replicate, use of multiple stocks/strains of animals to obtain an estimate of the range in sensitivities due to genotype, complete maternal pathology, and fetal histopathology and teratological evaluation. In a follow-up statistical analysis of these data, it was calculated that 805 litters per dose group would be necessary to detect a 5% increase in embryo resorption, suggesting that no standard regulatory study is adequately capable of evaluating the dose-response threshold at low response rates.[26][27] Based on these results, Holson recommended that U.S. FDA include a similar approach to standardize the statistical resolving power of tests relative to known interlaboratory and interspecies endpoint variability and variances.[26]/nHolson was also among the first developmental toxicologists to quantitatively evaluate the \"litter effect\" of studies in which fetal endpoints were assessed after the maternal animal was dosed.[28] Although litter-based statistical analyses had been conducted for body weight and survival parameters, Holson insisted that litter-based corrections should also be used for fetal malformations and variations.[1]/nBased on his early work, Holson was among the first teratology researchers to assert that the various endpoints of developmental toxicity studies (intrauterine growth retardation, malformations [birth defects], functional impairment, and death) in fact constituted a continuum of responses rather than discrete outcomes, which led him to conclude that human manifestations of teratogenicity across exposure levels were most commonly multiple outcomes.[1][7] Throughout his career Holson argued consistently that developmental toxicity must be viewed holistically, not simply as a group of disparate anatomical, functional, and postnatal defects, before such data can be effectively used to derive a complete estimate of human risks./nHolson was among the first to recognize that more emphasis needed to be placed on pharmacokinetic evaluations within developmental and reproductive toxicity studies in order to quantify the internal exposure to xenobiotics.[7] His team at NCTR conducted the first series of studies designed to assess the feasibility of using pharmacokinetics to improve the design, interpretation, and extrapolation of developmental toxicity studies, in an attempt to develop methods for predicting the magnitude of endpoints in teratology and to show how interlitter variability and inter-strain and inter-species differences could be better interpreted and accounted for based on differences in the handling of a compound. Throughout his career he emphasized the use of pharmacokinetic determinations as a necessary component of developmental, reproductive, and nonclinical juvenile toxicity studies.[1][5]/nHolson was also the first to apply the principle of comparative ontogeny of development (physiologic age) between organ systems in various species to the interpretation of developmental, reproductive, and pediatric toxicology data.[1][5]/nThroughout his career, Holson served as a key advisor to numerous product development programs (INDs, NDAs, TCSA consent orders, FIFRA registrations and international product registrations) and was the principal investigator in more than 600 safety assessment studies. In these studies he emphasized his longstanding principles of holistic evaluation of data, inclusion of pharmacokinetic endpoints where possible, robust and creative experimental designs, determination of the statistical power of the study relative to known variability in endpoints, and cognizance of comparative ontogeny of development.[1][5] In addition to LSD, FD&C Red No. 2, and 2,4,5-T, he was instrumental in significant developmental, reproductive, and/or nonclinical juvenile toxicity assessments of mirex,[2][29] inorganic arsenic,[4][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] nelfinavir (Viracept, an antiretroviral drug used to treat AIDS),[38][39] fluoxetine (Prozac),[40][41] two silicon-based ingredients found in breast implants and numerous personal care products (D4 and D5),[42][43][44] methyl iodide,[45][46] and HBOC-201 (a bovine hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier).[47][48][49]/nAfter retiring from active duties at WIL Research, Dr. Holson focused on conservation efforts on his 90-acre farm outside Ashland, Ohio. Since 1994, when he began to plant native prairie grasses and several thousand trees, he allowed the bulk of the property to gradually return to a natural state as a conservation habitat supported by Ohio's Conservation Reserve Program, including development of a 10-acre wildflower area designated as a pollinator habitat. He also maintains 45 acres of mature hardwood forest. This overall effort has facilitated Holson's personal study of conservation and animal behavior, including various flora and fauna./nFelony Drug & Sex Offender Charges/nIn August 2009, Dr. Holson plead guilty to the \"possession of cocaine and complicity involving the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance\",[50] which required him to register as a Tier I sex offender.

Several characters joined the organisation, seeking to prevent Voldemort from taking over the Wizarding World and establishing a tyrannical new world order. During this period, before the events of the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the Order sustained heavy losses, including the murders of minor characters such as the Prewetts, the Bones and the McKinnons. The Longbottoms were also tortured to insanity at the hands of Bellatrix Lestrange./nVoldemort's first reign of terror ended after the murders of James and Lily Potter, and the unsuccessful attempt to murder their son, Harry Potter, at the beginning of the series. The spell rebounded on to him and severely diminished Voldemort's powers and as a result the Order was temporarily disbanded due to the lack of any further threat./nWhen Harry reported that Voldemort had returned, towards the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore reactivated the Order.

Later in the novel, after Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry had succeeded, some Order members hosted \"Potterwatch\", a secret pirate radio programme providing news on the Wizarding World that Voldemort's regime did not want the general population to know. During the climax of the book, most of the Order, aided by Dumbledore's Army, the Hogwarts staff and the older students, Slytherin house members included,[1] fought against the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts, in which several Order members and other allies lost their lives./nThe following characters were members of the Order of the Phoenix during Lord Voldemort's initial rise to power and several years prior to the main events of the Harry Potter series. Many of these characters later served as members of the revived Order./nThese new members joined the Order when Dumbledore reactivated it after Lord Voldemort's return at the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire./nThis is a list of notable members of the Order of the Phoenix. Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape,  Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Fred and George Weasley have their own pages, and Peter Pettigrew is listed under Death Eater./nFleur Isabelle Delacour is a student of Beauxbatons Academy in France, and is selected as a champion in the prestigious Triwizard Tournament. Her maternal grandmother is a Veela, from whom Fleur inherited her silvery-blonde hair, pale eyes, good looks, and ability to enchant men. It is revealed in the Tournament wand inspection that the core of Fleur's wand is a Veela hair from her grandmother./nDuring the Triwizard Tournament, Fleur is initially aloof and unfriendly despite receiving much admiration from the boys, especially Ron. During the second task of the Tournament, she attempts to rescue her sister Gabrielle Delacour from the lake but fails, hindered by the Grindylows. When Harry rescues Gabrielle instead, Fleur is extremely grateful, despite her sister being in no real danger, and becomes much warmer towards both Harry and Hogwarts. Fleur finishes in 4th place in the Triwizard Tournament due to being Stunned during the last task./nIn the following year, Fleur works at Gringotts with Bill Weasley, whom she already met during the Tournament, and the pair become engaged. Bill is attacked and permanently scarred by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and severely mauled near the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. However, since Greyback is in his human form at the time of the attack, Bill suffers only partial lycanthropic contamination. Molly Weasley, who largely disapproves of Fleur, assumes that she will no longer wish to marry Bill, but Fleur is adamant that their wedding plans go unchanged and proudly declares Bill's wounds to be a sign of bravery, adding, \"I am good looking enough for the both of us anyway\". Her fierce, loving loyalty to her fianc\u00e9 earns her much respect from most of Bill's erstwhile disapproving family, especially Molly, who is finally forced to admit that their love is genuine./nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Fleur and Bill take part in the operation to escort Harry safely to the Burrow, and they witness Mad-Eye Moody being killed by Voldemort. The couple has their wedding and reception at the Burrow, but the event is interrupted when Death Eaters attack after the fall of the Ministry of Magic./nThey begin married life in a house on a beach in Wales called Shell Cottage. Fleur and Bill allow Ron to stay with them after he walks out on Harry and Hermione during their hunt for Horcruxes. The newlyweds later provide a safe haven for the trio and others rescued from Malfoy Manor at Shell Cottage. Both Bill and Fleur are combatants for the Order during the Battle of Hogwarts and manage to survive it. The couple go on to have three children: Victoire, Dominique and Louis.[3]/nFrench actress and model Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy portrays Fleur in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and both parts of the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows film adaptation./nAberforth Dumbledore is Albus Dumbledore's brother. He is his younger brother by some three years and the less skilled of the two; as such, he is usually left in the background while his brother basks in the glory of his comparative success. His first appearance is in the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. After his parents' deaths and Albus' return home to look after their unstable sister Ariana, Aberforth quarrels with his brother and his brother's friend, Gellert Grindelwald, over their plans to start a new order, neglecting Ariana. Grindelwald began torturing him, leading to the three dueling. This argument results in Ariana's accidental death at the hands of one of them. At Ariana's funeral, Aberforth publicly confronts Albus and strikes him, breaking his nose. Eventually, Aberforth becomes the owner and barman of the Hog's Head inn. He is known for his strong affinity with goats. His Patronus takes the form of a goat, and he recounts to the trio that as a boy he fed the goats in company with his sister, Ariana. Aberforth was also tried before the Wizengamot (the Wizard High Court), for performing inappropriate charms on a goat. His tavern also, according to Harry's description in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, has a faint smell of goats. In the film adaptation, a bleating goat can be seen shuffling about in the back of the pub./nIt is not until Deathly Hallows that Aberforth plays an important role in the series by taking Harry, Ron, and Hermione into his bar before the Death Eaters can capture them. Aberforth later reveals to the trio some facts they did not know about the history of the Dumbledore family. While being held prisoner in Malfoy Manor, Harry briefly glimpses Aberforth's eye in the remaining shard of the two-way mirror he was given by Sirius and calls for Aberforth's help. Aberforth bought its counterpart from Mundungus Fletcher. Using the mirror to watch over the trio, Aberforth sends Dobby to rescue them and the other prisoners from the Manor. He liked Dobby and was upset to hear Bellatrix Lestrange killed him./nAberforth allows the resistance fighters to use a secure passageway from the Hog's Head to the Room of Requirement through Ariana's portrait, it being the only unguarded entrance into Hogwarts. This passage is used to evacuate underage students from Hogwarts and, according to Neville, it was also used by members of Dumbledore's Army to get food when they were living in the Room of Requirement because that is one thing the Room of Requirement would not do. Aberforth leaves the Order, believing the war against Voldemort is lost. However, he quickly joins the Battle of Hogwarts and is last seen Stunning Augustus Rookwood. According to Rowling, Aberforth survives the battle, and is still \"at the Hog's Head, playing with his goats\".[4] He also appears in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore in which it is revealed that he has an illegitimate son named Aurelius Dumbledore as he had an affair with a woman who also lived in Godric's Hollow. She gave birth to Aurelius but, after sailing on a ship, the child was switched with Corvus Lestrange V by Leta Lestrange. Corvus and Aurelius's mother drowned, but Aurelius was adopted by Mary Lou Barebone who named him Credence Barebone. Years later, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and joins Gellert Grindelwald as he reveals his true identity to him. Credence returns to home with Aberforth when Grindelwald tried to kill him as he foils the latter's plan./nJim McManus appeared briefly as Aberforth in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[5] Ciar\u00e1n Hinds plays Aberforth in a larger role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2. Richard Coyle plays the middle-aged version of the character in the third Fantastic Beasts film, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore./nArabella Doreen Figg, better known simply as Mrs. Figg, is a Squib living undercover as a Muggle and on Dumbledore's orders surreptitiously watches over Harry while he is at home with the Dursleys. She is a Chekhov gun, first mentioned as a seemingly insignificant neighbour in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and not revealed as a member of the magical community until Order of the Phoenix. She has a lifelong love of cats and does \"a roaring trade\" in crossbred cats and Kneazles, their magical variant.[6] Within the Order of the Phoenix, she functions as one of Dumbledore's liaisons between the magical and Muggle worlds. In Order of the Phoenix, she aids Harry after he and his cousin Dudley Dursley are attacked by two Dementors, and chooses to reveal herself to him. She explains to Harry that she deliberately made Harry's stays with her unpleasant so that the Dursleys would continue to send him to her, though she would have preferred to do otherwise. When the Ministry of Magic tries to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts for underage use of magic (after he cast a Patronus charm to protect himself and his cousin), her testimony before the Wizengamot is crucial in allowing Harry to stay at Hogwarts. However, according to Rowling, Squibs are incapable of seeing Dementors,[6] and it is suggested by her manner during the trial that she has been prompted what to say with regard to the Dementors.[7] In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, she attends Dumbledore's funeral at Hogwarts./nMrs. Figg was portrayed by Kathryn Hunter in the film adaptation of Order of the Phoenix./nMundungus \"Dung\" Fletcher is mentioned in passing in some of the earlier books in the series, but it is not until the second chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he makes his first appearance. Mundungus is described as a \"squat, unshaven man\" with \"short, bandy legs\", \"long, straggly ginger hair\", and \"bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound\". He is involved in many illegal activities, yet he seems confined to relatively minor crimes, such as theft and trading stolen goods on the black market. Many members of the Order have mixed feelings about him, but he is very loyal to Dumbledore, who once got him out of serious trouble. His connections enable him to hear rumours and information rolling around the shadier segments of the Wizarding population, which could potentially prove instrumental in the fight against Voldemort./nHe is briefly mentioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire where following the Death Eaters attack at the Quidditch World Cup, Mundungus put in an insurance claim to the Ministry of Magic for a twelve-bedroomed tent with an en-suite jacuzzi, while in reality, he had been sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks. As a member of both the original and the newly reformed Order of the Phoenix, he is assigned guard duty to protect Harry, but abandons his position to conduct a shady cauldron-trading deal, leaving a critical opening through which Dementors manage to attack Harry. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry catches Mundungus outside the Three Broomsticks trying to sell what had been Sirius' property (which now belongs to Harry after Sirius' death) to Aberforth, and the boy confronts him. Mundungus goes into hiding but is later jailed in Azkaban for impersonating an Inferius during a botched robbery./nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Mundungus has managed to get out of prison, but the circumstances are unclear. He is Confunded by Snape, and gives the idea of using the Polyjuice Potion and six Potter decoys to the Order and helps with the escort of Harry from Privet Drive. He travels with Mad-Eye Moody on a broomstick as one of the Potter decoys. During the flight from Privet Drive, he flees when Voldemort himself shows up. It is later revealed by Kreacher that, included in the property he stole from 12 Grimmauld Place in the previous book was a heavy locket from the drawing room. That locket was the Slytherin's locket Horcrux. Then Kreacher is sent by Harry to capture Mundungus, who reveals that Umbridge took the locket from him under threat of arrest./nAndy Linden plays Mundungus Fletcher in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1./nAlastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody is perhaps the most famous Auror in the modern times of the Wizarding World, single-handedly responsible for capturing numerous wizard criminals. He is also said never to have killed his quarry, even when permitted to do so, unless he had no other choice. Moody's face is badly scarred; he has lost several body parts while fighting Dark wizards, including his left eye, lower left leg, and part of his nose; and he is cautious \u2013 some characters might say paranoid \u2013 in that he refuses to eat or drink anything which he himself did not prepare. He has replaced his missing eye with a magical one that can rotate 360 degrees and see through almost everything (including walls, doors, Invisibility Cloaks, and the back of his own head). He walks with a pronounced limp due to his prosthetic leg and uses a walking staff. He frequently exclaims \"Constant vigilance!\" to encourage wizards to be on their guard against the dark arts, and keeps a number of devices in his office to alert him to the presence of potential enemies. Before his retirement from the Aurors' Office, he was Nymphadora Tonks' mentor, and still regards her as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e./nIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Moody is appointed as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, coming out of retirement as a favour to Dumbledore. Shortly before the school year begins, however, Moody is attacked by Barty Crouch, Jr., who subdues him with the Imperius Curse and takes Polyjuice Potion to assume his appearance. He keeps the real Moody alive as a source both of Polyjuice potion ingredients and of personal information helpful in putting the impersonation over and takes Moody's place at Hogwarts. Moody's well-known habit of carrying around his own drinks in a private hip flask allows Crouch to take the Polyjuice Potion as needed to sustain the masquerade without raising suspicion./nCrouch/Moody becomes noted for teaching and demonstrating normally higher-level topics to Harry's fourth-year class (such as the Unforgivable Curses). He is a demanding teacher who expects students to work. He puts up with very little, for example punishing Draco Malfoy by transforming him into a ferret to stick up for Harry when Malfoy was tormenting him./nAfter Harry unexpectedly returns alive from the graveyard battle with Voldemort, Crouch/Moody takes Harry back to his office, questions him about Voldemort and what happened in the graveyard, and reveals that he is working for Voldemort. He then prepares to kill Harry, but Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape stop him. Having neglected to take his hourly dose of Polyjuice potion, Crouch transforms back to his own appearance and, under the influence of Veritaserum, confesses everything. Dumbledore then rescues the real Moody from his magic trunk.[8]/nIn Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the real Moody has joined the newly re-formed Order and leads the party transferring Harry from 4 Privet Drive to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He appears at the climax of that book, arriving at the battle at the Department of Mysteries after being tipped off by Snape. He also appears with Lupin and Tonks at the very end, when they give the Dursleys a warning concerning their treatment of Harry.[9] Moody only features briefly in Half-Blood Prince. In Deathly Hallows he is killed by Voldemort after being abandoned by Mundungus Fletcher, who was acting as a Potter decoy. The Order is unable to recover his body, but later his magical eye is found by Harry mounted on Dolores Umbridge's office door to spy on Ministry of Magic employees. Harry retrieves the eye, disgusted that it would be used in such a way, and buries it at the base of an old tree in Mad-Eye's memory./nMoody is portrayed by Brendan Gleeson in the film series./nJames Potter, nicknamed Prongs, is the father of Harry Potter and husband of Lily Potter (n\u00e9e Evans). James met Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew when they entered Hogwarts. When James, Sirius, and Peter discovered that Remus is, in fact, a werewolf, the three of them illegally learned to become Animagi to accompany Remus safely during his transformations and keep him under control. It is during this time that they discovered almost all the secret passageways of Hogwarts and designed the Marauder's Map.  At school, James is said to have been a talented player on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. In the film version of Philosopher's Stone, Harry and his friends find James' name listed on a plaque as a Seeker on his Quidditch team; however, Rowling stated in an interview that she intended him to be a Chaser.[10]/nRowling describes James and Harry as having similar attributes: the same thin face, the same hands, the same untidy black hair sticking up at the back, and about the same height at school age. However, Rowling also describes James as having hazel eyes and a slightly longer nose than Harry does. Like Harry, James is generally described to be a good, loyal friend who \"regarded it as the height of dishonour to mistrust his friends\".[11] Characters in the books sometimes comment negatively on James' personality, about which Rowling comments that \"there was a lot of good in James\".[12] The Hogwarts student population seems to have admired James back in his day, and teachers respected his talent, though not his behaviour; he was quite the prankster along with his fellow marauders./nHis popularity, however, was not universal, as a mutual hatred sprang up between him and Snape. Snape constantly tells Harry that James was \"exceedingly arrogant\",[13] and on one occasion, Sirius admits that he and James could sometimes be \"arrogant little berks\" but that \"James grew out of it\" (which Lily is said to have noted by their seventh year). He became Head Boy in his seventh year along with Lily as Head Girl.[14]/nIn Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, after seeing a scene from Snape's memories within a Pensieve of a fifteen-year-old James and Sirius bullying Snape, Harry agrees with Snape's assessment of his father's arrogance. According to Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, however, James and Snape shared a rivalry, not unlike that of Draco and Harry. In addition, Lupin tells Harry that Snape \"never lost an opportunity to curse James\".[14] According to an interview with Rowling, \"James always suspected Snape harboured deeper feelings for Lily, which was a factor in James' behaviour to Snape.\"[2] However, when Sirius attempts to lure Snape into the Shrieking Shack where Lupin stays during his werewolf transformations, James prevents him from entering the tunnel under the Whomping Willow, thus saving Snape's life; although \u2013 as Snape points out \u2013 this also saved James from expulsion./nAfter graduating from Hogwarts, James \u2013 along with Lily and his friends \u2013 become \"full-time fighters\" for the Order, and do not hold regular jobs, supporting his family and Lupin, whose status as a werewolf made him unemployable, on family gold.[15] In an interview, Rowling revealed that James and Lily were asked by Voldemort to join the Death Eaters, but refused, making it \"one strike against them before they were even out of their teens\".[16] When his son Harry becomes Voldemort's target, the Potters go into hiding and name Pettigrew as their secret keeper. However, on 31 October 1981, the Potters' whereabouts are betrayed by Pettigrew, and they are attacked by Voldemort without warning at their home in Godric's Hollow. James urges his wife to take Harry and run while he holds Voldemort off. Wandless, he is killed./nHe briefly appears in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as a result of Priori Incantatem, when Harry's wand and Voldemort's meet, showing the most recent spells cast by each \u2013 in the case of Voldemort's wand, the most recent lives taken. He makes a final appearance at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows through the use of the Resurrection Stone./nJames and Sirius are the heroes of the Harry Potter prequel, an 800-word story set three years before Harry's birth.[17] The two friends are riding Sirius' motorbike and are chased by two Muggle policemen for breaking the speed limit. The policemen attempt to arrest them when three Death Eaters on broomsticks fly down towards them. James and Sirius use the police car as a barrier and the Death Eaters crash into it. In the end, they escape from the policemen by flying away on the motorbike./nIn the film series, James is portrayed by Adrian Rawlins as an adult, Robbie Jarvis as a teenager and Alfie McIlwain as a child.[18]/nLily J. Potter (n\u00e9e Evans) is the mother of Harry Potter. She is described as being very pretty,[19] with startlingly green almond-shaped eyes and thick, long, dark auburn hair. She is one of the \"all-time favorite students\" of star collector Horace Slughorn, who describes her as \"vivacious\", \"charming\", \"cheeky\", and \"very funny\" and recalls that he \"often told her she should have been in Slytherin\". In addition, Slughorn says Lily is one of the brightest students he ever taught, with a natural and intuitive ability at Potions.[20][21] Rowling describes Lily as being \"a bit of a catch\"; she was a popular girl for whom many boys had romantic feelings.[22] Although Lily is Muggle-born, she is an extremely gifted witch at the top of her class. She became Head Girl in her seventh year. Lily's sister Petunia Dursley despised her for being a witch and viewed her as a \"freak\", although Petunia is later revealed to have been envious of her abilities. Rowling stated that Lily did receive warning letters for testing the limits of the Statute of Secrecy.[23] Lily's Patronus is a doe, presumably to pair with James' Animagus shape of a stag (also the form of Harry's Patronus).[2]/nAfter witnessing a memory from Snape about Lily's and James' time as Hogwarts students, Harry gathers the impression that Lily hated James, but Sirius and Lupin assure him that she did not; they \"simply got off on the wrong foot\", because Snape and James hated each other, and Snape was Lily's best friend at the time, despite him sorting into Slytherin.[14] Rowling confirmed this view when asked how Lily and James had fallen in love if Lily hated him.[22] Lupin tells Harry that after James matured, Lily started seeing him in their seventh year.[14] Rowling later echoed Lupin's words, describing it as James having to \"[tone] down some of his more 'bombastic' behavior\".[12] They married soon after leaving Hogwarts, with Sirius as best man at their wedding./nThe old, pre-Hogwarts friendship between Lily and Snape is fully revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, along with the fact that Snape harboured unrequited romantic feelings for Lily from childhood. Rowling states that while Lily loved Snape as a friend, she might have returned those romantic feelings if Snape had not become so seriously involved in the Dark Arts.[24] Their relationship ends in their fifth year at Hogwarts, when Snape, in his anger and humiliation at being jinxed by James and Sirius, unthinkingly calls Lily a \"Mudblood\" after she defended him./nAfter leaving Hogwarts, Snape becomes a Death Eater and informs Voldemort of half of an overheard prophecy, which Voldemort takes to refer to Lily and her son, Harry. Fearing for Lily's life, Snape joins the Order as a spy for Dumbledore, in exchange for what he hopes will be Dumbledore's protection of Lily. Voldemort offers Lily the chance to step aside before he kills Harry because of Snape's request to spare Lily's life, but Lily refuses and Voldemort kills her.[25] The result of her selfless act of love manifests itself two ways: when Voldemort attempted to kill Harry with the Killing Curse the spell backfired, rendering Voldemort non-corporeal. The lingering protection afforded to Harry by Lily's sacrifice rendered Voldemort unable to touch him physically. The second way in which Harry is protected by Lily's sacrifice occurs when Petunia takes Harry in. Dumbledore tells Harry that Lily's protection was extended to Privet Drive because Lily and Petunia are related by blood. This protection ends when Harry comes of age at 17./nThough Harry bears a great resemblance to his father, it is often noted that he has Lily's eyes. Dumbledore has said that Harry's deepest nature is much more similar to his mother's.[26] In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that \"he has his mother's eyes, and that's very important in a future book\".[27] That future book was Deathly Hallows. In Snape's death scene in that novel, after having passed on his memories to Harry, he whispers to Harry: \"Look... at... me...\" In one of Snape's memories, it is revealed that Dumbledore persuades Snape to protect Harry after Lily's death by mentioning the fact that he has \"precisely\" the same eyes as his mother. His last words to Harry were simply a desire to see Lily's eyes before he died./nHarry's dead parents are seen five times in the books (not counting their appearances in numerous magical photographs). Firstly in Philosopher's Stone, Harry sees James and Lily in the Mirror of Erised. Secondly during Harry's struggle with Voldemort in Goblet of Fire, they appear momentarily, along with other victims killed by Voldemort's wand. They appear in Snape's memories in both Order of the Phoenix and Deathly Hallows, and finally in Deathly Hallows when Harry makes his self-sacrificing walk into the Forbidden Forest, determined to let Voldemort kill him without offering resistance, Harry's parents walk at his side and Lily tells him how proud they are of him./nIn an interview[28] conducted by Daniel Radcliffe, Rowling revealed that Lily Potter's maiden name, Evans, was based on the real name of the author George Eliot, Mary Anne Evans./nLily is portrayed by Geraldine Somerville as an adult in the film series, and by Susie Shinner as a teenager and Ellie Darcey-Alden as a child./nKingsley Shacklebolt is a senior Auror who acts as informer for the Order within the Ministry of Magic. He is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, when he volunteers to be one of the members of the Advance Guard that escorted Harry from the Dursleys' home to Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Kingsley is in charge of the search for Sirius in the Ministry; however, knowing Sirius is innocent, he is supplying the Ministry false information that Sirius is in Tibet. He is present in the scene of the fifth book when Harry is confronted about Dumbledore's Army, after Marietta Edgecombe betrays it to Dolores Umbridge. Kingsley swiftly modifies Marietta's memory, but to avoid suspicion from the Ministry, Dumbledore is forced to hex him too as he flees./nKingsley takes part in the battle at the Department of Mysteries and appears to be very skilled at duelling as he is seen fighting two Death Eaters at once. However, after Sirius is killed, he continues the duel with Bellatrix Lestrange, during which Kingsley is hit by a spell that causes a \"loud bang\" and he hits the ground \"yelling in pain\". In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, appoints Kingsley to the Muggle Prime Minister's office, posing as a secretary, but being the Prime Minister's guard./nIt is revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that Kingsley is one of the few wizards that the Dursleys seem to like, due to his skill at blending in well with Muggles and his calm, collected demeanour. In that book, Kingsley first appears with other Order members to move Harry from the Dursleys' home to safety in the Burrow. Later in the book, he manages to send a timely warning to Bill and Fleur's wedding using his Patronus, a lynx, when Voldemort overthrows the Ministry of Magic, giving the guests a chance to escape. He continues to guard the Prime Minister but is eventually forced to flee. He later is heard preaching equal rights for Muggles and Wizards on the pirate radio programme \"Potterwatch\" under the pseudonym \"Royal\". In the Battle of Hogwarts, he is first seen organising those who remained to fight. He is later seen dueling an unnamed Death Eater, and ends up duelling Voldemort himself, alongside Minerva McGonagall and Horace Slughorn, but after Bellatrix's death, Voldemort's anger erupts; Kingsley and the two others are defeated (although not killed). Kingsley is appointed temporary Minister for Magic following the death of Voldemort and the deposition of Voldemort's puppet ruler, Pius Thicknesse. However, it was later revealed by Rowling in an interview that Kingsley did become the new Minister permanently, revolutionising the Ministry itself.[2]/nGeorge Harris appeared as Kingsley in the movies Order of the Phoenix and both parts of Deathly Hallows./nNymphadora Tonks is a Metamorphmagus and an Auror. Her name means \"Gift of the Nymphs\". She despises her first name and prefers to be called by her surname alone. She is still referred to as \"Tonks\" by her peers even after her marriage./nShe is described as having \"a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes\", and is usually depicted with different hair colours, which she can change at will. Tonks is seen to be notoriously clumsy and unskilled at household spells. Nymphadora is the only daughter of Ted and Andromeda Tonks, the latter being sister to Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy; Nymphadora is therefore Draco Malfoy's first cousin yet she never addresses him as family, alluding to him simply as \"the Malfoy boy\". Tonks is sorted into Hufflepuff,[29] and graduates from Hogwarts one year before Harry enters, after which she begins three years of Auror training; under Moody's tutelage, she qualifies as an Auror one year before her first appearance in Order of the Phoenix./nTonks and Kingsley act as spies for the Order in the Ministry. She helps to escort Harry first from the Dursleys' house to Order headquarters, and later to the Hogwarts Express. Tonks later fights the Death Eaters at the Department of Mysteries, in which she is injured by Bellatrix, and has to be taken to St Mungo's. During Half-Blood Prince, Tonks is stationed at Hogsmeade and assigned to guard Hogwarts. Harry observes she is constantly depressed and rarely smiles. Also, he sees her hair is a mousy brown instead of its usual bright bubble-gum pink. After Dumbledore's death, it is revealed that Tonks has fallen in love with Lupin, and her Patronus has, as a result, changed to the form of a wolf. Lupin is reluctant to return her affections arguing that he is \"too old, too poor, and too dangerous\" for her. Because of this, she falls into a depression that disturbs her magical abilities including her ability to change her appearance at will./nHowever, early in Deathly Hallows, Tonks announces that she has recently married Remus Lupin. Tonks accompanies twelve Order members to take Harry from the Dursleys' home to The Burrow. She flies with Ron, who impersonates Harry using Polyjuice Potion to throw the Death Eaters off the real Harry's trail. During the aerial battle, Tonks fights Bellatrix again and injures Bellatrix's husband, Rodolphus. Later in the book, Remus reveals Tonks is pregnant. He leaves her for a brief period, believing that he, through their marriage, has caused her to become an outcast and their unborn child would be better off without him, but changes his mind and returns to her side after a heated argument with Harry. In April of the seventh book, Tonks gives birth to Teddy Remus Lupin, named after her father and husband. Towards the end of the book, Tonks and Lupin join the Battle of Hogwarts. During the battle, Tonks is killed by Bellatrix, and Lupin is killed by Antonin Dolohov, leaving Teddy an orphan to be raised by his maternal grandmother, Andromeda.[2] In an interview shortly after the release of Deathly Hallows, Rowling confessed that she had originally intended for Tonks and Lupin to survive the series ending, but felt that she had to kill them after she spared Arthur Weasley in Order of the Phoenix.[30][31]/nNatalia Tena played Tonks in the film versions of Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and both parts of Deathly Hallows./nArthur Weasley is the patriarch of the Weasleys, a family of wizards who are considered \"blood traitors\" by Death Eaters for their interest in the Muggle world. He is married to Molly Weasley, with whom he has seven children, including Ron, Harry's best friend. During his time at Hogwarts, Arthur belonged to the house of Gryffindor. Arthur is described as being tall and thin, and as having a receding hairline and horn-rimmed glasses. An affable, light-hearted man, he tends not to be the authority figure in the family; his wife Molly handles that area. Arthur works for the Ministry of Magic, initially in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. He is obsessed with learning about Muggle customs and inventions and owns a large collection of mostly Muggle used items. His department lacks funding, and his salary is only just able to provide for a vast family, leaving his family finances precarious./nMr. Weasley first appears in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, when Harry stays with the Weasley family at The Burrow during the summer before the first term of Hogwarts begins. In this book, Lucius Malfoy tries to discredit Arthur when Harry and Ron are seen flying his enchanted car and by placing Tom Riddle's diary in Ginny's cauldron so that she can open the Chamber of Secrets and take the blame for the attacks on Muggle-borns. However, Lucius fails to fulfil his objective and the diary is destroyed./nAt the start of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Arthur wins a large cash prize in a sweepstake and uses it to take the whole family on a holiday to Egypt. After they return, Arthur thinks that Harry should know (what Arthur then believes to be) the truth about Sirius Black. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it seems that Arthur does not fully believe the stories of Harry's abuse at the hands of the Dursleys until he witnesses what they think about Harry and the Wizarding World and is stunned to see them so eager to say goodbye to him, before taking him to the Quidditch World Cup. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Mr. Weasley is a member of the Order and accompanies Harry to his visit to the Ministry. During one of his shifts in the Ministry guarding Sybill Trelawney's prophecy, Voldemort's pet snake Nagini attacks him. Harry, who is mentally connected with Voldemort, manages to see this in a vision and is able to warn the Hogwarts authorities. Arthur is subsequently saved just in time and sent to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, where he fully recovers.[32] Rowling has revealed that in the original draft for Order of the Phoenix she planned to kill Arthur.[33] She changed her mind, however, saying that she could not kill Arthur as he is one of the few good fathers in the series. However, as she \"wanted to kill parents\", she spared Arthur's life in exchange for Lupin's and Tonks'.[31] In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Arthur has been promoted to Head of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects./nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Arthur is part of the group that moves Harry from Privet Drive for the last time, accompanied by his son Fred who acted as one of the seven Potters. Arthur continues to work in the Ministry but all his movements are tracked. When it is discovered that Ron is travelling with Harry and not sick at home, the Weasleys are forced to hide. Arthur reappears in the Battle of Hogwarts, in which he loses his son Fred, and is joined by Percy Weasley in defeating Pius Thicknesse./nArthur Weasley appears in every film except the first and is portrayed by Mark Williams./nWilliam Arthur \"Bill\" Weasley  is the eldest born son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. He is described to be \"hard-working\" and \"down-to-earth\", but possesses a fondness for \"a bit of adventure, a bit of glamour\".[34] During his time at Hogwarts, Bill becomes both a prefect and Head Boy, with 12 OWLs to his credit. Later, he works for Gringotts Bank in Egypt as a Curse-Breaker./nHe makes his first full appearance in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where he is described as being a good-looking young man, sporting long red hair tied back in a ponytail and a single fang earring. When he and Mrs Weasley pay a visit to Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament, Fleur eyes him with \"great interest\". Bill returns to Britain to work with the Order in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He meets Fleur at Gringotts head office in London where she is employed at the time, giving her lessons to improve her English. After a year-long relationship, the couple gets engaged, and Bill brings his fianc\u00e9e home to get to know his family, who disapprove of her./nBill fights against the Death Eaters' attack at Hogwarts near the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, where he is attacked by werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who disfigures him. As Greyback was in human form at the time of the attack, Bill suffers only partial lycanthropy contamination\u2014permanent scarring of his face, and an acquired liking for very rare beef. Fleur, who regards his wounds as a proud sign of his bravery, is adamant that their wedding proceed as scheduled, impressing Bill's family about the match's strength. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Fleur and Bill take part in getting Harry escorted safely from the Dursleys' house, and they witness Mad-Eye Moody being killed by Voldemort himself, which they announce upon their return to the Burrow. The couple have their wedding there and later provide a safe haven for the trio and several others in their home, Shell Cottage. Both Bill and Fleur were combatants during the Battle of Hogwarts, and both survived the battle. Bill and Fleur later have three children: Victoire, Dominique and Louis.[3]/nRichard Fish appeared as Bill briefly in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Domhnall Gleeson, the son of actor Brendan Gleeson (Alastor Moody in the series), plays Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and the roller coaster ride Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter \u2013 Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida./nCharlie  Weasley is the second son of Arthur and Molly Weasley and is described as having a build like that of his brothers Fred and George: shorter and stockier than Bill, Percy and Ron. He has a broad, good-natured face, which is slightly weather-beaten and very freckly. His arms are muscly, and one of them has a long shiny burn. While at Hogwarts, he was a prefect,[35] a Quidditch Captain, and a legendary Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. His skills as a Seeker were so good that it was said, \"He could have been capped for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\"/nAfter school, Charlie chooses to go to Romania to work with dragons as a Dragon Keeper. At Harry, Ron and Hermione's request, he takes Hagrid's baby dragon, Norbert, an illegally hatched Norwegian Ridgeback, into his care in Harry's first year, and he is part of a team of Dragon Keepers that brings four dragons of different breeds to Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament./nDuring the second rise of Voldemort, Charlie's task in the Order is to try to rally support abroad. Charlie returns to the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to participate in his brother Bill's wedding as best man. He enters the later part of the Battle of Hogwarts, alongside Horace Slughorn, at the head of reinforcements for the defenders, and survives the battle without serious injury. He does not marry or have children, since he \"preferred dragons to women\", according to Rowling.[3]/nAlex Crockford appeared briefly as Charlie in the film adaptation of Prisoner of Azkaban./nMolly Weasley (n\u00e9e Prewett)[36] is the wife of Arthur Weasley and the matriarch of the Weasley family. She is the mother of seven children, including Ron Weasley, who becomes Harry Potter's best friend. Molly is born into the pure-blood Prewett family, being the sister of Gideon and Fabian Prewett. The character is first introduced in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she kindly tells Harry how to cross the barrier through to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she is furious with Fred, George, and Ron after she discovers that they flew their parents' enchanted car to rescue Harry from his aunt and uncle who had imprisoned him in his room. At the beginning of the school year, Molly sends Ron a Howler, expressing her anger and shock at him for flying the car again, this time to Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Weasleys win the Daily Prophet draw and use the gold on a trip to Egypt to visit Bill. They return to Britain and stay at The Leaky Cauldron with Harry and Hermione. Harry overhears Mr and Mrs Weasley arguing one night about telling Harry the truth about the supposed connection between Sirius Black and Harry; Arthur feels Harry should know the truth but Molly, feeling the truth would terrify him, assures him Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts with Dumbledore's protection, and orders Percy Weasley to keep an eye on Harry at the school./nWhen Harry arrives at the Burrow in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Molly finds out about Fred and George's experimentation with dangerous sweets they were manufacturing and tells them off before leaving for the Quidditch World Cup; however, after the Dark Mark appears over the sky at the World Cup campsite, Molly is upset for yelling at Fred and George, worried that something might have happened to them after she treated them so horribly. Towards the climax of that book, Molly and Bill arrive at Hogwarts to see the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, acting as family guests to Harry. After the return of Voldemort, Dumbledore asks Molly and Bill to join the Order and fight in the impending Second War. Molly comforts Harry and, for the first time in his life, he has someone to be there for him, like a mother./nMolly and the Weasleys are staying at the Order headquarters, Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she and Sirius fight over how much to tell Harry about the Order's operations. Days later, Molly is found in the drawing room, with a boggart that transforms into her dead family members and Harry, and confesses her nightmares of losing more family members to Voldemort and the Death Eaters. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Molly clashes with Bill's fianc\u00e9e, Fleur Delacour; however, at the end of the novel, when Molly rushes to Hogwarts with her husband and Fleur to tend to her son Bill, who had been ferociously attacked by Fenrir Greyback, Fleur is greatly offended when Molly jumps to the conclusion she will break up with Bill due to his scarring, letting her know in no uncertain terms that his scars are a reminder of the courage that Bill displayed.[37] Fleur and Molly unexpectedly hug and begin to see each other in a much more positive light./nAt the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Molly and Arthur offer the Burrow as Order headquarters when Grimmauld Place is no longer safe. She feels immensely uncomfortable with the trio's decision to drop out of Hogwarts and initially attempts to dissuade them from doing so. As the novel progresses, the family is forced to head for safety at Auntie Muriel's home. At the end of the book, Molly and her entire family fight in the Battle of Hogwarts. She is devastated by the death of her son Fred and is pushed to the edge when Bellatrix Lestrange almost strikes Ginny with the Killing Curse. Enraged, she engages Bellatrix in an intense duel, killing her with a curse that hits her in the chest.[38] Rowling has stated that the reason she had Molly kill Bellatrix was to show Molly's great powers as a witch and to provide a contrast between Molly's consumption with \"maternal love\" and Bellatrix's with \"obsessive love\".[39]/nThe Chicago Tribune's Courtney Crowder lists Molly Weasley as her favourite literary mother, describing her as the \"original Mama Grizzly\", citing her many touching moments with Harry as well as the final book in the series, where \"her feelings jumped off the page\" as testament to her strong personality. Crowder summarises Molly's character as \"levelheaded, yet willing to fight, intelligent, welcoming, and above all, extremely loving\".[40] In a Mother's Day article Molly was also voted the third greatest celebrity mother by The Flowers and Plants association who see the character as \"formidable, practical, creative and resourceful\".[41] Bob Smietana of Christianity Today links Molly's defence of Ginny in the final book into a wider theme in the series about the strength of parental love, which he feels to carry considerable emotional weight.[42] Empire listed Molly Weasley 24th on their Top 30 Harry Potter characters.[43] Novelist Stephen King notes that when Molly called Bellatrix a \"bitch\" after she sees the Death Eater trying to kill Ginny, it was \"the most shocking bitch in recent fiction\", and that it shows how adult the books had become.[44]/nJulie Walters portrays Molly Weasley in every film except Goblet of Fire, in which her role in the novel is cut out. In 2003, BBC voted her portrayal of Molly as the second-\"best screen mother\", behind Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich.[45]", "43705341": "Maria Illarionovna Prokhorova (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, IPA: [m\u0250\u02c8rij\u0259 \u026al(\u02d0)\u0259r\u02b2\u026a\u02c8on\u0259vn\u0259 \u02c8prox\u0259r\u0259v\u0259]; July 20, 1903 \u2013 1993) was a Russian scientist, biologist, the Head of Molotov University,[1] the Dean of Faculty of Biology and Soil Studies[2][3] at Leningrad State University; also she was the Head of A.A.

The stress of misfolded and damaged proteins influences neuronal function and lifespan at the level of the organism. Consequently, these studies provide a molecular basis to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and Alzheimer's disease.

Riehl was to head up a uranium production group at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal\u2019 (\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c[6]).[7][8]/nFrom 1945 to 1950, Riehl was in charge of uranium production at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'.  When Riehl learned that H. J. Born and Karl Zimmer were being held in Krasnogorsk, in the main PoW camp for Germans with scientific degrees, Riehl arranged though Zavenyagin to have them sent to Ehlektrostal\u2019. Catsch, who had been taken prisoner with Zimmer, was also sent to the Ehlektrostal\u2019 Plant No. 12.[9] At Ehlektrostal\u2019, Riehl had a hard time incorporating Born, Catsch, and Zimmer into his tasking on uranium production, as Born was a radiochemist, Catsch was a physician and radiation biologist, and Zimmer was a physicist and radiation biologist.[10][11][12]/nAfter the detonation of the Russian uranium bomb, uranium production was going smoothly and Riehl's oversight was no longer necessary at Plant No. 12. Riehl then went, in 1950, to head an institute in Sungul', where he stayed until 1952. Essentially the remaining personnel in his group were assigned elsewhere, with the exception of H. E. Ortmann, A. Baroni (PoW), and Herbert Schmitz (PoW), who went with Riehl. However, Riehl had already sent Born, Catsch, and Zimmer to the institute in December 1947. The institute in Sungul\u2019 was responsible for the handling, treatment, and use of radioactive products generated in reactors, as well as radiation biology, dosimetry, and radiochemistry. The institute was known as Laboratory B, and it was overseen by the 9th Chief Directorate of the NKVD (MVD after 1946), the same organization which oversaw the Russian Alsos operation. The scientific staff of Laboratory B \u2013 a ShARAShKA \u2013 was both Soviet and German, the former being mostly political prisoners or exiles, although some of the service staff were criminals.[13][14] (Laboratory V, in Obninsk, headed by Heinz Pose, was also a sharashka and working on the Soviet atomic bomb project. Other notable Germans at the facility were Werner Czulius, Hans J\u00fcrgen von Oertzen, Ernst Rexer, and Carl Friedrich Weiss.[15])/nLaboratory B was known under another cover name[16] as \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442 0211 (Ob\u2019ekt 0211, Object 0211), as well as Object B.[17][18][19][20] (In 1955, Laboratory B was closed. Some of its personnel were transferred elsewhere, but most of them were assimilated into a new, second nuclear weapons institute, Scientific Research Institute-1011, NII-1011, today known as the Russian Federal Nuclear Center All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics, RFYaTs\u2013VNIITF. NII-1011 had the designation \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043f/\u044f 0215, i.e., enterprise post office box 0215 and \u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442 0215; the latter designation has also been used in reference to Laboratory B after its closure and assimilation into NII-1011.[21][22][23][24])/nOne of the political prisoners in Laboratory B was Riehls\u2019 colleague from the KWIH, N. V. Timofeev-Resovskij, who, as a Soviet citizen, was arrested by the Soviet forces in Berlin at the conclusion of the war, and he was sentenced to 10 years in the Gulag. In 1947, Timofeev-Resovskij was rescued out of a harsh Gulag prison camp, nursed back to health, and sent to Sungul' to complete his sentence, but still make a contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Laboratory B, Timofeev-Resovskij headed a biophysics research department, in which Born, Catsch, and Zimmer were able to conduct work similar to that which they had done in Germany, and all three became section heads in Timofeev-Resovskij's department. In fact, in Sungul', Catsch began his work on developing methods to extract radionucleotides from various organs, which he would continue when he left Russia.[13][14][24]/nIn preparation for release from the Soviet Union, it was standard practice to put personnel into quarantine for a few years if they worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project, as was the case for Catsch. Additionally, in 1954, the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) and the Soviet Union prepared a list of scientists they wished to keep in the DDR, due to their having worked on projects related to the Soviet atomic bomb project; this list was known as the \u201cA-list\u201d. On this A-list were the names of 18 scientists. Nine, possibly 10, of the names were associated with the Riehl group which worked at Plant No. 12 in Ehlektrostal'. Born, Catsch, Riehl, and Zimmer were on the list.[25][26][27]/nIn Russia, Catsch was given a patronymic and his last name was transliterated from German into Russian; transliterated into English his name became Aleksandr Sergeevich Katsch.[1][28]/nCatsch returned to the DDR in the mid-1950s and fled West. Riehl arrived in the DDR on 4 April 1955, and by early June he was in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).

Many of his past students are notable biologists, including Nobel Laureate Sidney Altman, as well as Mark Ptashne, Susan Lindquist, Stephen F. Heinemann, and Richard I. Morimoto./nMeselson was born in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1930, and attended elementary and high school in Los Angeles, California. While a young child he was interested in chemistry and physics, and conducted many experiments in the natural sciences at home. During World War II, Meselson attended summer school during summer vacations and received enough high school credits to graduate a year and a half ahead of time. When he attempted to acquire his diploma from the registrar at his high school, however, he was informed that in order to receive his high school diploma, he needed three full years of physical education, which he lacked. After searching for options, he enrolled at the University of Chicago at the age of 16 in 1946 intending to study chemistry, since it did not require a high school diploma to attend.[2]/nAt the University of Chicago, Meselson studied liberal arts including history and classics as an undergraduate from 1946 to 1949 after realizing upon arriving that the university had abolished bachelor's degrees in specialized field such as chemistry and physics. After completing his studies, Meselson spent half a year traveling in Europe. where he spend most of his time reading and making friends. The devastation of the war was still evident in Europe in 1949, as were the beginning tensions of the Cold War. The following year, Meselson returned to Caltech to begin freshman studies again, but disliked the pedagogical approach in most of the courses he took. He enrolled, however, in Linus Pauling's freshman chemistry course, which he loved, and worked on a project for Pauling the same year on hemoglobin structure.[3]/nMeselson subsequently returned to the University of Chicago for a year to enroll in courses in chemistry, physics, and math, though he did not receive another degree. The following year, he was accepted into a graduate physics program at the University of California at Berkeley where he remained for a year. In the summer of 1953, Meselson was at a swimming pool party at the Pauling home in Sierra Madre (he was friends with Pauling's son Peter and with his daughter Linda), and Pauling asked him what he intended to do the following year. Upon hearing Meselson respond that he intended to return to the University of Chicago, Pauling immediately asked him to come to Caltech to begin graduate studies with him, to which Meselson agreed. As a graduate student of Linus Pauling in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology (1953-1957), Meselson's doctoral dissertation was on equilibrium density gradient centrifugation and on x-ray crystallography.  Besides Pauling, Meselson's dissertation committee also included Jerome Vinograd, Richard Feynman, and Harden M. McConnell.[4]  Meselson then served as Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry and then Senior Research Fellow at Caltech until he joined the Harvard faculty in 1960./nIn 1957, Meselson and Franklin Stahl (as part of the phage group) showed that DNA replicates semi-conservatively.[5] In order to test hypotheses for how DNA replicates, Meselson and Stahl, together with Jerome Vinograd, invented a method that separates macromolecules according to their buoyant density.[6] The method, equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, was sufficiently sensitive that Meselson and Stahl were able to separate DNA containing the heavy isotope of nitrogen, 15N, from DNA made of the lighter isotope, 14N. In their classic experiment, described and analyzed in a book by science historian Frederic L. Holmes,[7] they grew the bacterium Escherichia coli for many generations in medium containing 15N as the only nitrogen source and then switched the bacteria to growth medium containing 14N instead. They extracted DNA from bacteria prior to switching and, at intervals, for several generations thereafter. After one generation of growth, all the DNA was seen to have a density halfway between that of 15N DNA and 14N DNA. In successive generations, the fraction of DNA that was \"half-heavy\" fell by a factor of \u00bd, as the total amount of DNA increased two-fold. When the half-heavy DNA was made single stranded by heating, it separated into two density species, one heavy (containing only 15N) and one light (containing only 14N). The experiment implied that, upon replication, the two complementary strands of the bacterial DNA separate, and that each of the single strands directs the synthesis of a new, complementary strand, a result that verified the suggestion for DNA replication put forward five years earlier by James Watson and Francis Crick[8]  and lent important early support for the Watson-Crick model of the DNA molecule./nIn collaboration with Jean Weigle, Meselson then applied the density gradient method to studies of genetic recombination in the bacteriophage Lambda.[9] The question was whether such recombination involved breakage of the recombining DNA molecules or cooperative synthesis of new molecules. The question could be answered by examining phage particles derived from co-infection of bacteria with genetically marked Lambda phages that were labeled with heavy isotopes (13C and 15N).  The density-gradient method allowed individual progeny phages to be characterized for their inheritance of parental DNA and of parental genetic makers.  Meselson's initial demonstration of breakage-associated, replication-independent recombination was later found to reflect the activity of a special system that can recombine Lambda DNA at only one spot, normally used by the phage to insert itself into the chromosome of a host cell. Subsequently, variations of the experiment by Franklin Stahl revealed reciprocal dependencies between DNA replication and most genetic recombination.[10] With Charles Radding, Meselson developed a model for recombination between DNA duplexes that guided research in the field for the decade from 1973 to 1983.[11]/nIn 1961, Sydney Brenner, Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Meselson used the density-gradient method to demonstrate the existence of messenger RNA.[12][13] In subsequent work, Meselson and his students demonstrated the enzymatic basis of host-directed restriction,[14] a process by which cells recognize and destroy foreign DNA and then predicted and demonstrated methyl-directed mismatch repair,[15][16][17] a process that enables cells to correct mistakes in replicating DNA.  Meselson's current research is aimed at understanding the advantage of sexual reproduction in evolution.  Meselson and his colleagues have recently demonstrated that Bdelloid rotifers do, in fact, engage in sexual reproduction employing meiosis of an atypical sort.[18]/nWhen two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky,[19] but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect. In sexual organisms, the processes of recombination and independent assortment allow both of the alleles within an individual to descend from a recent single ancestral allele. Without recombination or independent assortment, alleles cannot descend from a recent ancestral allele. Instead the alleles share a last common allelic ancestor at or just preceding the loss of meiotic recombination.[20] A striking example of this effect was described in bdelloid rotifers, in which the two alleles of the lea gene have diverged into two different genes which work together to preserve the organism during periods of dehydration.[21] The Meselson effect should cause entire copies of an organism's genome to diverge from each other, effectively reducing all anciently asexual organisms to a haploid state, in a process similar to the diploidization following whole genome duplication./nHowever, gene conversion, a form of recombination common in asexual organisms, may prevent the Meselson effect from occurring in young asexual organisms[22] and may limit the effect in Bdelloid rotifers.[23] Moreover, a number of putative examples of the Meselson effect remain controversial because other biological process, such as hybridation, can mimic the Meselson effect.[24][25][26][27][28]/nIn 1963 Meselson served as a resident consultant in the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, where he became interested in chemical and biological weapons programs and policies. Since then he has been involved in chemical and biological weapons defense and disarmament matters as a consultant to various US government agencies and through the Harvard Sussex Program, an academic research organization based at Harvard and at the University of Sussex in the UK of which he and Julian Perry Robinson in the UK are co-directors./nConcluding that biological weapons served no substantial military purpose for the US and that their proliferation would pose a serious threat and that, in years ahead, the exploitation of advanced biology for hostile purposes would be inimical to society generally, he worked to persuade members of the Executive Branch, the Congress and the public that the US had no need for such weapons and that there would be benefits in renouncing them and working for worldwide prohibition. After President Richard Nixon in 1969 canceled the US BW offensive program and endorsed a UK proposal for an international ban, Meselson was among those who successfully advocated international agreements to ban biological and then chemical weapons, leading to the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993./nMeselson and his colleagues have undertaken three on-site investigations with implications for chemical and biological weapons arms control. During August and September 1970, on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Meselson led a team in the Republic of Vietnam in a pilot study of the ecological and health effects of the military use of herbicides.[29][30][31] Upon returning to Harvard, he and Robert Baughman developed an advanced mass-spectrometric method for analysis of the toxic herbicide contaminant dioxin and applied it to environmental and biomedical samples from the Vietnam and the US. In December 1970, President Richard Nixon ordered a \"rapid but orderly\" phase-out of herbicide operations in Vietnam.[32]/nDuring the 1980s, Meselson investigated allegations that \"yellow rain\" was a Soviet toxin weapon being used against Hmong tribespeople in Laos. Citing the physical appearance and high pollen content of samples of the alleged agent; the resemblance of the alleged attacks to showers of feces from swarms of honeybees that he and entomologist Thomas Seeley documented during a 1983 field study in Thailand; the inability of US and UK government laboratories to corroborate initial reports of the presence of trichothecene mycotoxins in samples of the alleged agent and in biomedical samples from alleged victims; the lack of any supporting evidence from extensive interviews with Vietnamese military defectors and prisoners; and other considerations, Meselson and his colleagues argued that the allegations were mistaken.[33][34][35][36]/nIn April 1980 Meselson served as a resident consultant to the CIA investigating a major outbreak of anthrax among people in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk. He concluded that on the basis of available evidence the official Soviet explanation that the outbreak was caused by consumption of meat from infected cattle was plausible but that there should be an independent on-site investigation. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was allowed to bring a team to Sverdlovsk in 1992 and again in 1993.  Their reports conclusively showed that the official Soviet explanation was wrong and that the outbreak was caused by the release of an anthrax aerosol at a military biological facility in the city.[37][38]/nMeselson is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Paris), the Royal Society (London) and the Russian Academy of Sciences and has received numerous awards and honors in the field of science and in public affairs.

A major strand of his early research concerned the effect of temperature on the development of fertilized sea urchin eggs. In this work he used a micromanipulator, which was developed by Robert Chambers, an American biologist./nDuring Ephrussi's time, writing a second dissertation was standard practice in France. Ephrussi's involved culturing tissues.[1] Ephrussi ran into difficulties typically associated with early tissue culture techniques, but despite these obstacles Ephrussi managed to conclude from studies of brachyury in mice that intrinsic factors (i.e. genes) play a key role in development./nAs the next phase of his career, Ephrussi coupled his embryological concerns with a firm conviction that one must understand the role of genes in order to decipher embryological processes. He moved to Caltech in 1934 and stayed until 1935 to learn genetics within the intellectual empire of T.H. Morgan. This move was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. During this period he conducted important work with George Beadle, who joined him in Paris in the autumn of 1935.

Following this he began work in France on yeast and cytoplasmic genetics. He began working at the Institut de Biologie Physicochimique (the Rothschild Institute) in Paris, and later worked at the CNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette, where he studied the contribution of cytoplasm to the cell phenotype and pursued the interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic endowments necessary to the yielding of an intact, functioning (albeit single-celled) organism.[4] Boris Ephrussi was a pioneer in questioning the consensus at the time that heredity could be accounted for exclusively by nuclear genes.[5][6] Ephrussi famously said, \"we cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it.\"[7]/nEphrussi was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1958),[8] the United States National Academy of Sciences (1961),[9] and the American Philosophical Society in 1970.[10]/nEphrussi continued to work on the topics he was primarily interested until the late 1970s.

Parodi (born March 16, 1942) is an Argentine glycobiologist. He did his initial education at the School of Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. His PhD work was done under Luis Federico Leloir, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work involving the finding of sugar nucleotides and how they play a role in the making of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. He also pursued postdoc work at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France and Duke University in Durham, NC, USA./nAlthough his father was a physician who worked more in academia than in a clinic, the lack of strong science teachers in secondary school led him to become more interested in politics. However, when he graduated high school, Parodi attended the School of Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. The reason for this, was his interest in Chemistry that developed as a result of having a Chemistry teacher in secondary school that excited him about the subject. Due to the restructuring of the Higher Education system as a result of Juan Per\u00f3n\u2019s dictatorship, many of his professors were younger and recent graduates of post-doctoral programs in the US and Europe. During his final year at the University of Buenos Aires, his father suggested that he should pursue his PhD at the Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto Leloir, and so he enrolled in the Biochemistry course there. While working under Luis F. Leloir, Parodi saw that Leloir was able to synthesize particulate glycogen in vitro and that influenced the direction of his future research.[1]/nParodi also completed a 2 year postdoctoral fellowship at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France.[2]/nWhile working under Luis F. Leloir, Parodi\u2019s research was involved with the synthesis of particulate glycogen de novo using UDP-Glc and rat livers for glycogen synthase. In 1970, he joined Leloir and Nicolas Behrens in their research that was involved with the incubation of dolichol-P-Glc using liver microsomes to transfer glucose to a dolichol-P-P-linked glycan known as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol.[1]/nAfter completing his fellowship in Paris, and returning to Buenos Aires, between the years of 1975 and 1978, he conducted research involved with demonstrating the presence of a dolichol-P-dependent pathway of N-glycosylation in yeast. However, a paper in 1980 that stated the lack of free or sugar-bound dolichol-P in trypanosomatid protozoa meant that the pathway he discovered was not in the organism. This lead him to do his own research with trypanosomatids and using 14C Glucose he found that the synthesis of dolichol-P-P-glycans in protozoa was possible but glucose was lacking in the formed glycans.[2]/nFurther research into glycans in trypanosomes, specifically Trypanosoma cruzi, was conducted by Parodi. Using short pulses of 14C, three protein glycans were produced and they were known as Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man8GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2. These were then replaced by Man9GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2, and Man6GlcNAc2 in the mature versions of the glycoproteins. This led to the conclusion that the transfer of a glucose to the Man9GlcNAc2 was the only way that Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 could have been made.[3]/nParodi also looked into how glucosylation/deglucosylation in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum were involved with the correct folding of N-linked glycoproteins. His research led him to find that misfolding allowed for conformations that would allow for glycoproteins to act as glucose acceptors. He was able to find this using UDP-Glc: glycoprotein GT that worked as ways of sensing the various conformations of the glycoproteins. The sensitive of GT was very helpful as it was able to detect formations that were undetectable via other methods. This work was crucial in discovering how protein folding was controlled. By looking at how GT encouraged proper folding, the enzyme was found as a stress protein and there was increased synthesis of it during periods of stress for the endoplasmic reticulum.[4]/nRecent work by Parodi has looked at how Glucosidase I removes glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. He has looked at how glycosylation MOGS-CDG leads to Glucosidase 1 encoding gene mutations. Absence of this GI has been linked to death in certain yeasts, specifically, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

Using specific monoclonal antibodies, LBPA/BMP was shown to be enriched in intralumenal vesicles of late endosomes[46] and to regulate the intracellular transport and homeostasis of cholesterol.[47][31] LBPA/BMP is also directly involved in the formation of intracellular vesicles within multivesicular endosomes and endosome-mimicking liposomes.[37]", "38659255": "Erich Hoyt (born 28 September 1950) is a whale and dolphin (cetacean) researcher, conservationist, lecturer and author of 26 books and more than 700 reports, articles and papers.[1][2][3][4] His book Marine Protected Areas for Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises (Earthscan, Taylor & Francis, 2005; 2nd edition, 2011), has been widely reviewed as the \"definitive reference of the current extent of cetacean ecosystems-based management\"[5] and as \"a unique and essential book for anybody interested in the conservation and protection of cetaceans.

He founded China's salt industry, as well as banks, factories, pharmacies, and tea shops around the country.[2] Both her grandfather and father were also talented painters and calligraphers.[2][3] Convinced of the importance of education, Yan Zijun hired university teachers to tutor the children from a young age in English and Chinese before they attended primary school in Shanghai.[2][4]/nIn 1908, Yan entered McTyeire School, a private girls' school. In 1913, the family moved to Tianjin,[1] where Yan and two of her sisters, Lianyun\u00a0[zh] and Youyun prepared for the entrance exams of the Chinese and Western Girls' High School.[2]  She passed the examination and enrolled in the middle of 1914, completing her studies there in June 1917.[1][2] She was admitted to Nanjing Jinling Women's University (later renamed Ginling College), earning a bachelor's degree with honours in 1921. As Yan was keen to continue her education, her father allowed her to go abroad to study in the United States.[1] She enrolled in chemistry studies at Smith College in 1922, and began using the English name \"Daisy Yen\".[1][5] Over the summer break, she took courses at the University of Chicago in chemistry, nutrition, and physics and the next fall enrolled in biochemistry courses at Teachers College, Columbia University. She studied nutrition, a field which at the time was in its infancy, under Henry Clapp Sherman and Mary Swartz Rose, taking particular interest in the analysis of vitamin content in food. She received her master's degree in May 1923.[1]/nYen was hired by the China Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation as an assistant professor in biochemistry at Peking Union Medical College and contracted for a year from September 1923. The biochemistry department had just been founded and Yen was its second employee. She lectured and worked as an assistant to Hsien Wu, whose research initially focused on blood chemistry. She assisted in his research on protein denaturation and published several papers with him: \u5173\u4e8e\u7a00\u9178\u3001\u7a00\u78b1\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u89c2\u5bdf (Some New Observations on the Effects of Dilute Acids and Bases on Proteins, 1924), \u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0cI\uff0e\u7a00\u9178\u548c\u7a00\u78b1\u5bf9\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd (Research on Protein Denaturation, I: The Effect of Dilute Acid and Alkali on Protein, 1924), \u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7684\u70ed\u53d8\u6027 (Thermal Denaturation of Protein, 1925), and \u4e73\u80f6\u4f53\u5bf9\u6709\u8272\u6eb6\u6db2\u7684\u4f5c\u7528 (The Effect of Latex on Colored Solution, 1926). These studies would later become the basis for Hsien Wu's theory on protein denaturation first presented in 1931.[1][6]/nDespite her contract being renewed for another year, when Yen and Wu decided to marry, she knew her position would be terminated, as there was a policy that spouses could not work together. The couple married on 20 December 1924 in Shanghai and Yen Wu resigned. They honeymooned in the United States and Yen Wu made plans to resume her studies and complete her doctoral work under Sherman at Columbia. She accompanied Hsien Wu to Europe and discovered she was pregnant, which put an end to her pursuit for further education, and she returned to China. Working as unpaid staff in Hsien Wu's lab, she continued to assist in research, but papers published rarely listed her name as the primary researcher. She also temporarily taught organic chemistry for students at the Xiehe Nursing School.[1]/nYen Wu conducted her own research on nutrition for the biochemistry department, believed to be the first such studies carried out by a woman in China.[1] She analyzed the chemical composition of many types of Chinese foods. Vitamin research was still in its infancy, but she determined the amount of carbohydrates, fat, fiber, protein, and water in various foods. Together with Hsien Wu, she began researching vegetarianism, the predominant Chinese diet at the time, using white mice as subjects, a technique Yen had learned from Sherman. By feeding one set of mice a typical diet based on grains such as corn, rice, sorghum, and wheat combined with peas, soybeans, and other vegetables; and another mouse group a diet of grain and meat, they discovered significant growth differentials and problems with rickets in the vegetarian group. Altering the vegetarian diet by adding bell peppers, cabbage, mustard greens, or rapeseed they found that growth rates were similar to the meat-eating mice and the animals had no signs of vitamin deficiencies.[1]/nHer next joint project with Hsien Wu was to conduct research on the diet of people in Beijing. The Department of Public Health and Sanitation collected materials from various groups throughout the country, including businesses, factories, farms, households, restaurants, and schools and presented their survey results to Yen and Hsien. They analyzed the survey, determining daily consumption rates of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins finding that the diet of people in Beijing was fairly representative of a typical diet throughout the country. They noted that compared to a Western diet, there were deficiencies in high-quality protein, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins A and D. Their conclusions were that malnutrition was the cause of the high rates of disease and mortality, as well as intellectual disabilities and short stature, prevalent among Chinese children at the time.[1] Their collaboration produced \u8425\u517b\u6982\u8bba (Introduction to Nutrition, 1929) the first textbook on nutrition in China.[1][7][8] Hsien Wu also published \u4e2d\u56fd\u98df\u7269\u4e4b\u8425\u517b\u4ef7\u503c (The Nutritional Value of Chinese Food, 1928) incorporating Yen's research.[1]/nIn 1928, after the birth of her third child, Yen Wu withdrew from active work in the laboratory and focused on raising her children while compiling the research notes of her husband and assisting him in the development of his career. Within seven years of marrying, she had given birth to five children and was concerned about the level of educational opportunities available for them. She founded the Mingming School (Chinese: \u660e\u660e\u5b66\u6821) in 1934 with the aim of providing a modern comprehensive education and hired Wang Suyi, an alumnus of Columbia, as principal and a full-time teacher. The private school was operated by a board of her friends upon which she served as treasurer. Yen Wu was a member of various civic improvement clubs and worked with her sisters to raise funds in 1936 to build a school hospital for their alma mater, the Jinling Women's College. She returned to school, studying French at the Sino-French University\u00a0[zh] and graduating in 1944.[1] In 1947, Hsien Wu went to the United States to work as a visiting professor at Columbia University, but was unable to return because of the Chinese Communist Revolution.[1][9] When the communists took over their home in Beijing in 1949, Yen Wu decided to join him abroad.[1][10]/nYen Wu brought the children to Birmingham, Alabama, where Hsien Wu had become chair of the biochemistry department at the University of Alabama.[7] In 1950, she was hired to work as a biochemical researcher for the Medical College of Alabama.[11] As before, she conducted research jointly with her husband, until he suffered a heart attack in 1953 and retired. They moved to Boston, where Yen Wu cared for Hsien Wu and compiled their research.[1][9] Between 1949 and 1959, they published four papers and wrote three abstracts for presentation at academic conferences, mostly about amino acid metabolism. After Hsien Wu died on 8 August 1959, Yen Wu published her husband's biography and in 1960, moved to New York City, to be near her children.[1]/nIn the spring of 1960, Yen Wu was hired as a researcher by the Food Conservation Division of the United Nations Children's Fund. She was tasked with testing various foods and making recommendations to improve nutritional standards for children.[1] In 1961, she established the Yen Tse-King Memorial Scholarship, in honor of her father, and the Wu Hsien Memorial Scholarship, in honor of her husband, at the Tunghai University in Taichung, Taiwan. The scholarships were intended to be awarded annually to assist women students in become physicians or any student of biological chemistry in completing their education.[12] In August 1964, Yen Wu went to work at the Institute of Human Nutrition at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she built a reference library and organized finding aids for the materials for the staff and students of the college.[1]/nIn 1971, she retired but began working three days a week as a consultant in nutrition and metabolism for St. Luke's Hospital Center. Her work there was to establish the library for the New York Obesity Research Center.[1] She also lectured on public health and nutrition at Columbia University.[11] In addition to her employment, Yen Wu began editing and updating the publication \u8425\u517b\u6982\u8bba (Introduction to Nutrition). She wrote eight supplemental chapters and a new edition of the book was published in Taiwan in 1974,[1][13] and remained in print until the 1990s.[7][Notes 1]/nAfter a thaw in the cold war relations between China and the US leading to normalization in the 1970s, Yen Wu returned to China. She visited relatives in 1980 and 1984. In 1983, she attended the celebration for the 70th anniversary of the founding of Jinling Women's University with family and former classmates. That year, she established a scholarship fund named after her husband to be awarded by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to fund the research of professors who have contributed to the development of Chinese biochemistry and molecular biology. She retired in 1987 and lived alone until 1992, when she moved to the home of her eldest son in Ithaca, New York. In 1993, to honor her husband's 100th birthday, she donated funds to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to establish a biochemical library and purchase books, and created a scholarship at Harvard Medical School, both bearing his name.[1]/nYen Wu died on 27 May 1993 at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, after a heart attack, and was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery, in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.[1][14] The Wus' research papers on metabolism, diet, and nutrition were foundational to the development of later ideas on modern Chinese health and nutrition. At the time their work was completed, it was one of the most influential in China and led the biochemical department at Peking Union Medical College to prioritize studying nutrition.[1] The papers they produced have become a prerequisite to any discussion of the historical development of nutritional study in China.[1]/nThe couple's son, Ray Wu, became a noted molecular biologist at Cornell University, having \"developed the first method for sequencing DNA\" and was \"widely recognized as one of the fathers of plant genetic engineering.\"[15] In addition to the scholarships she founded, the Hsien and Daisy Yen Wu Scholarship was founded at Cornell to assist graduate students in completing their education. Harvard has an endowed chair, the Hsien Wu and Daisy Yen Wu Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, named in their honor.[16][17]", "67790020": "Christiana Ruhrberg is a German-British cell biologist who is Professor of Neuronal and Vascular Biology, University College London.

In 2011, he proposed the \"Biodiversity-related Niches Differentiation Theory (BNDT)\"[11] in which he argued that the number of niches in an ecosystem depends on the number of species present in a particular moment and that the species themselves allow the enhancement of niches in terms of space and number. He found that using a three-dimensional model as an ecological hypervolume and testing the theory on different ecosystems it is possible to demonstrate that each species plays a fundamental role in facilitating the colonization by other species by simply modifying the environment and exponentially increasing the available niches. The BNDT stresses the evidence that the process of niche differentiation is strictly addressed by species. This approach has various consequences, first in the reconsideration of the patterns of species coexistence and second in terms of a better understanding of the actual importance of cooperation and competition in the evolution of biological diversity.[12]\nMore recently, he published a scientific paper on the evolution of cooperation[13] in which he argued that the assumption of the 5 main rules for the evolution of cooperation that payoffs are known by the parties and do not change during the time is a limitation because following each rule blindly, there is a risk for individuals to get stuck in an unfavourable situation. Therefore, he proposed that individuals in nature employ a multi-armed bandit (MAB) model, the \u03b5-greedy algorithm, to opt for the best choice most of the time and cooperation evolves as a process nested in the hierarchical levels that exist among the five rules. This reinforcement learning model provides a powerful tool to better understand and even probabilistically quantify the chances of cooperation evolution./nIn 2013, he wrote the novel-essay \"The paradox of civilization\" (in Italian: \"Il paradosso della civilt\u00e0\"). The book is inspired by his journeys in tropical areas, the encounters with African Pygmies and the life in the wild and narrates the abuses of civilised societies over the environment and indigenous people.[14]/nIn 2017, for the centenary of the \"biodiversity\" concept proposal, he published a comprehensive review on open questions and some answers about biodiversity to address the future of the research on this topic.[15]/nIn 2018, in a paper entitled \"Is Gaia alive? The future of a symbiotic planet\"[16] \u2013 published in the scientific journal \"Futures\" \u2013 he described different situations according to which \"Gaia\", the Earth, would be able to reproduce and to transfer her planetary genome to other uninhabited or inhabited planets. Prof. Cazzolla Gatti argued that our species could act as a germinal cell carrying a specific planetary genome, but it is unlikely for Homo sapiens sapiens to reproduce (or survive disconnected from Earth) on another Gaian system. In what is considered a breakthrough in astrobiology,[17] the Italian scientist hypothesised that human beings will reproduce Earth's biosphere in the universe. \"However\u2014he said\u2014as a spermatozoon, which loses its flagellum and acrosome while entering into the egg of another body, therefore changing its identity, a human being can be considered just as a carrier of its body's (i.e., Gaia's) genetic information, not of himself: a means more than an aim\".[18]/nHe worked on several aspects of theoretical, conservation and climate change biology such as the emergence of ecological and economic niches,[19] a new index to estimate and compare biodiversity with a single universal metric,[20] the effects of climate change in accelerating the upward shift of the treeline in the Altai Mountains during the last-century[21] and in inducing the melting of the Maliy Aktru glacier (Altai Mountains, Russia) as revealed studying a primary ecological succession,[22] and the role of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) in the storage, emission and deposition of carbon in lakes and rivers of the River Ob flood plain, western Siberia.[23]/nHe also developed interests in the ability to learn from the environment of invertebrates and how predation changes the behaviour of some species of terrestrial isopods.[24]/nIn 2019 and 2020, he coordinated two studies on environmental sustainability[25][26] that show how the certifications of palm oil are not reducing deforestation in Southeast Asia, taking place of endangered Bornean and Sumatran large mammals habitat, and this could represent a catastrophe for the biodiversity of this region.[27]/nIn 2020 and 2021, after the first COVID-19 global outbreak, he published several studies on the relationships between the environment and the pandemic, suggesting that coronavirus outbreak is a symptom of Gaia's sickness,[28] discussing the global consequences for wildlife conservation after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,[29] providing evidence to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 did not emerge from a lab but from wildlife exploitation,[30] and proving\u2014by the use of artificial intelligence\u2014that prolonged exposure to air pollution is associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality and infectivity.[31]/nIn 2022, he led an international research, showing that our planet might be hosting approximately 9,000 tree species yet to be discovered. A third of these are rare species with a population that is restricted both in terms of numbers and areas. This was one of the main results of the first-ever estimate of tree species richness at the global level published in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Science of the United States (PNAS).[32]/nIn 2018, he was interviewed by Vice magazine among 105 other \"interdisciplinary thinkers\".[33]", "69067989": "Louise Hoyt Gregory (July 21, 1880 \u2013 November 1, 1954) was an American zoologist and college professor.

He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was Professor for Public Understanding of Science in the University of Oxford from 1995 to 2008. His 1976 book The Selfish Gene popularised the gene-centred view of evolution, as well as coining the term meme. Dawkins has won several academic and writing awards.[4]/nDawkins is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design as well as for being a vocal atheist.[5] Dawkins wrote The Blind Watchmaker in 1986, arguing against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker, in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any sentient designer. In 2006, Dawkins published The God Delusion, contending that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science in 2006.[6][7] Dawkins has published two volumes of memoirs, An Appetite for Wonder (2013) and Brief Candle in the Dark (2015)./nDawkins was born Clinton Richard Dawkins on 26 March 1941 in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya during British colonial rule.[8] He later dropped Clinton from his name by deed poll.[3] He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (n\u00e9e Ladner; 1916\u20132019)[9][10] and Clinton John Dawkins (1915\u20132010), an agricultural civil servant in the British Colonial Service in Nyasaland (present-day Malawi), of an Oxfordshire landed gentry family.[8][11][12] His father was called up into the King's African Rifles during the Second World War[13][14] and returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he farmed commercially.[12] Dawkins lives in Oxford, England.[15] He has a younger sister, Sarah.[16]/nHis parents were interested in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins's questions in scientific terms.[17] Dawkins describes his childhood as \"a normal Anglican upbringing\".[18] He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that the theory of evolution alone was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god.[16] He states: \"The main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing.\"[16] This understanding of atheism combined with his western cultural background, informs Dawkins as he describes himself in several interviews as a \"cultural Christian\" and a \"cultural Anglican\".[19][20][21]/nOn his return to England from Nyasaland in 1949, at the age of eight, Dawkins joined Chafyn Grove School, in Wiltshire,[22] and after that from 1954 to 1959 attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English public school with a Church of England ethos,[16] where he was in Laundimer House.[23] While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian for the first time.[24] He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He graduated with upper-second class honours.[25]/nDawkins continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his Doctor of Philosophy[26] degree by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year.[27][28] Tinbergen was a pioneer in the study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning, and choice;[29] Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.[30]/nFrom 1967 to 1969, Dawkins was an assistant professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War, and Dawkins became involved in the anti-war demonstrations and activities.[31] He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970 as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a reader in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by Charles Simonyi with the express intention that the holder \"be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field\",[32] and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins.[33] He held that professorship from 1995 until 2008.[34]/nSince 1970, he has been a fellow of New College, Oxford, and he is now an emeritus fellow.[35][36] He has delivered many lectures, including the Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture (1989), the first Erasmus Darwin Memorial Lecture (1990), the Michael Faraday Lecture (1991), the T. H. Huxley Memorial Lecture (1992), the Irvine Memorial Lecture (1997), the Tinbergen Lecture (2004), and the Tanner Lectures (2003).[27] In 1991, he gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for Children on Growing Up in the Universe. He also has edited several journals and has acted as an editorial advisor to the Encarta Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia of Evolution. He is listed as a senior editor and a columnist of the Council for Secular Humanism's Free Inquiry magazine and has been a member of the editorial board of Skeptic magazine since its foundation.[37]/nDawkins has sat on judging panels for awards as diverse as the Royal Society's Faraday Award and the British Academy Television Awards,[27] and has been president of the Biological Sciences section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2004, Balliol College, Oxford, instituted the Dawkins Prize, awarded for \"outstanding research into the ecology and behaviour of animals whose welfare and survival may be endangered by human activities\".[38] In September 2008, he retired from his professorship, announcing plans to \"write a book aimed at youngsters in which he will warn them against believing in 'anti-scientific' fairytales.\"[39]/nIn 2011, Dawkins joined the professoriate of the New College of the Humanities, a private university in London established by A. C. Grayling, which opened in September 2012.[40]/nDawkins is best known for his popularisation of the gene as the principal unit of selection in evolution; this view is most clearly set out in two of his books:[41][42]/nDawkins has consistently been sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as spandrels, described by Gould and Lewontin)[45] and about selection at levels \"above\" that of the gene.[46] He is particularly sceptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism.[47]/nAltruism appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own chances for survival, or \"fitness\". Previously, many had interpreted altruism as an aspect of group selection, suggesting that individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism, including close relatives.[48][a] Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation.[49] Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work.[50]/nIn June 2012, Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E. O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection.[51][52] Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.[53][54][55]/nCritics of Dawkins's biological approach suggest that taking the gene as the unit of selection (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading. The gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of evolution (the long-term changes in allele frequencies in a population).[56] In The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains that he is using George C. Williams's definition of the gene as \"that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency\".[57] Another common objection is that a gene cannot survive alone, but must cooperate with other genes to build an individual, and therefore a gene cannot be an independent \"unit\".[58] In The Extended Phenotype, Dawkins suggests that from an individual gene's viewpoint, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted./nAdvocates for higher levels of selection (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene,[59][60] has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist;[61] she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.[62] Besides, other, more recent views and analysis on his popular science works also exist.[63]/nIn a set of controversies over the mechanisms and interpretation of evolution (what has been called 'The Darwin Wars'),[64][65] one faction is often named after Dawkins, while the other faction is named after the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, reflecting the pre-eminence of each as a populariser of the pertinent ideas.[66][67] In particular, Dawkins and Gould have been prominent commentators in the controversy over sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, with Dawkins generally approving and Gould generally being critical.[68] A typical example of Dawkins's position is his scathing review of Not in Our Genes by Steven Rose, Leon J. Kamin, and Richard C. Lewontin.[69] Two other thinkers who are often considered to be allied with Dawkins on the subject are Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett; Dennett has promoted a gene-centred view of evolution and defended reductionism in biology.[70] Despite their academic disagreements, Dawkins and Gould did not have a hostile personal relationship, and Dawkins dedicated a large portion of his 2003 book A Devil's Chaplain posthumously to Gould, who had died the previous year./nWhen asked if Darwinism informs his everyday apprehension of life, Dawkins says, \"In one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide open to the extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That's never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand, I certainly don't allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life\", implying that he feels that individual human beings can opt out of the survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.[15]/nIn his book The Selfish Gene, Dawkins coined the word meme (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes.[71] It was intended as an extension of his \"replicators\" argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors, such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. These popularisations then led to the emergence of memetics, a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.[72]/nDawkins's meme refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.[73]/nAlthough Dawkins invented the term meme, he has not claimed that the idea was entirely novel,[74] and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon.[75] Semon regarded \"mneme\" as the collective set of neural memory traces (conscious or subconscious) that were inherited, although such view would be considered as Lamarckian by modern biologists.[76] Laurent also found the use of the term mneme in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and Maeterlinck himself stated that he obtained the phrase from Semon's work.[75] In his own work, Maeterlinck tried to explain memory in termites and ants by claiming that neural memory traces were added \"upon the individual mneme\".[76] Nonetheless, James Gleick describes Dawkins's concept of the meme as \"his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytising against religiosity\".[77]/nIn 2006, Dawkins founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS), a non-profit organisation. RDFRS financed research on the psychology of belief and religion, financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported charitable organisations that are secular in nature.[78] In January 2016, it was announced that the foundation was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with Dawkins becoming a member of the new organization's board of directors.[79]/nDawkins was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilised world could still be so uneducated in biology,[80] and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins says that some physicists use 'God' as a metaphor for the general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which he claims causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being who forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die.[81]/nHe disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA)[82] and suggests that the existence of God should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other.[83] Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence.[84] He considers faith\u2014belief that is not based on evidence\u2014as \"one of the world's great evils\".[85]/nOn his spectrum of theistic probability, which ranges from 1 (100% certainty that a God or gods exist) to 7 (100% certainty that a God or gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he is a 6.9, which represents a \"de facto atheist\" who thinks \"I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.\" When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, \"I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden.\"[86][87] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion.[88] In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized religious beliefs as irrational, such as that Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.[96]/nDawkins has risen to prominence in public debates concerning science and religion since the publication of his most popular book, The God Delusion, in 2006, which became an international bestseller.[97] As of 2015, more than three million copies have been sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages.[98] Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism.[99] In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion\u2014\"a fixed false belief\".[100] In his February 2002 TED talk entitled \"Militant atheism\", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science.[101] On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens's residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and entitled \"The Four Horsemen\".[102]/nDawkins sees education and consciousness-raising as the primary tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination.[31][103][104] These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term bright as a way of associating positive public connotations with those who possess a naturalistic worldview.[104] He has given support to the idea of a free-thinking school,[105] which would not \"indoctrinate children\" but would instead teach children to ask for evidence and be skeptical, critical, and open-minded. Such a school, says Dawkins, should \"teach comparative religion, and teach it properly without any bias towards particular religions, and including historically important but dead religions, such as those of ancient Greece and the Norse gods, if only because these, like the Abrahamic scriptures, are important for understanding English literature and European history.\"[106][107] Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of feminists in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of \"he\" instead of \"she\", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as \"Catholic child\" and \"Muslim child\" should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, \"Marxist child\", as he believes that children should not be classified based on the ideological or religious beliefs of their parents.[104]/nWhile some critics, such as writer Christopher Hitchens, psychologist Steven Pinker and Nobel laureates Sir Harold Kroto, James D. Watson, and Steven Weinberg have defended Dawkins's stance on religion and praised his work,[108] others, including Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, astrophysicist Martin Rees, philosopher of science Michael Ruse, literary critic Terry Eagleton, philosopher Roger Scruton, academic and social critic Camille Paglia, atheist philosopher Daniel Came and theologian Alister McGrath,[115] have criticised Dawkins on various grounds, including the assertion that his work simply serves as an atheist counterpart to religious fundamentalism rather than a productive critique of it, and that he has fundamentally misapprehended the foundations of the theological positions he claims to refute. Rees and Higgs, in particular, have both rejected Dawkins's confrontational stance toward religion as narrow and \"embarrassing\", with Higgs going as far as to equate Dawkins with the religious fundamentalists he criticises.[116][117][118][119] Atheist philosopher John Gray has denounced Dawkins as an \"anti-religious missionary\", whose assertions are \"in no sense novel or original\", suggesting that \"transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind, Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings.\" Gray has also criticised Dawkins's perceived allegiance to Darwin, stating that if \"science, for Darwin, was a method of inquiry that enabled him to edge tentatively and humbly toward the truth, for Dawkins, science is an unquestioned view of the world.\"[120] A 2016 study found that many British scientists held an unfavourable view of Dawkins and his attitude towards religion.[121]\nIn response to his critics, Dawkins maintains that theologians are no better than scientists in addressing deep cosmological questions and that he is not a fundamentalist, as he is willing to change his mind in the face of new evidence.[122][123][124]/nDawkins has faced backlash over some of his public comments about Islam. In 2013, Dawkins tweeted that \"All the world's Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the Middle Ages, though.\"[125] In 2016, Dawkins' invitation to speak at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism was withdrawn over his sharing of what was characterized as a \"highly offensive video\" satirically showing cartoon feminist and Islamist characters singing about the things they hold in common. In issuing the tweet, Dawkins stated that it \"Obviously doesn't apply to vast majority of feminists, among whom I count myself. But the minority are pernicious.\"[126]/nDawkins is a prominent critic of creationism, a religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity[127] without recourse to evolution.[128] He has described the young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as \"a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood\".[129] His 1986 book, The Blind Watchmaker, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the eighteenth-century English theologian William Paley via his book Natural Theology, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things\u2014with their far greater complexity\u2014be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, blind watchmaker.[130]/nIn 1986, Dawkins and biologist John Maynard Smith participated in an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society).[b] In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because \"what they seek is the oxygen of respectability\", and doing so would \"give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all\". He suggests that creationists \"don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.\"[131] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that \"among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.\" When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word theory, Dawkins stated that \"evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening.\" He added that \"it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English.\"[132]/nDawkins has opposed the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, describing it as \"not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one\".[133] He has been referred to in the media as \"Darwin's Rottweiler\",[134][135] a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as \"Darwin's Bulldog\" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's evolutionary ideas. He has been a strong critic of the British organisation Truth in Science, which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and whose work Dawkins has described as an \"educational scandal\". He plans to subsidise schools through the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work.[136]/nDawkins is an outspoken atheist[137] and a supporter of various atheist, secular,[138][139] and humanist organisations,[140][141][142][143] including Humanists UK and the Brights movement.[101] Dawkins suggests that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, stressing that atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind.[144] He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware of just how many people are nonbelievers, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority.[145] Inspired by the gay rights movement, he endorsed the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly.[146] He supported a UK atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008 and 2009, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.[147]/nDawkins has expressed concern about the growth of the human population and about the matter of overpopulation.[148] In The Selfish Gene, he briefly mentions population growth, giving the example of Latin America, whose population, at the time the book was written, was doubling every 40\u00a0years. He is critical of Roman Catholic attitudes to family planning and population control, stating that leaders who forbid contraception and \"express a preference for 'natural' methods of population limitation\" will get just such a method in the form of starvation.[149]/nAs a supporter of the Great Ape Project\u2014a movement to extend certain moral and legal rights to all great apes\u2014Dawkins contributed the article 'Gaps in the Mind' to the Great Ape Project book edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer. In this essay, he criticises contemporary society's moral attitudes as being based on a \"discontinuous, speciesist imperative\".[150]/nDawkins also regularly comments in newspapers and blogs on contemporary political questions and is a frequent contributor to the online science and culture digest 3 Quarks Daily.[151] His opinions include opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq,[152] the British nuclear deterrent, the actions of then-US President George W. Bush,[153] and the ethics of designer babies.[154] Several such articles were included in A Devil's Chaplain, an anthology of writings about science, religion, and politics. He is also a supporter of Republic's campaign to replace the British monarchy with a democratically elected president.[155] Dawkins has described himself as a Labour voter in the 1970s[156] and voter for the Liberal Democrats since the party's creation. In 2009, he spoke at the party's conference in opposition to blasphemy laws, alternative medicine, and faith schools. In the UK general election of 2010, Dawkins officially endorsed the Liberal Democrats, in support of their campaign for electoral reform and for their \"refusal to pander to 'faith'\".[157] In the run up to the 2017 general election, Dawkins once again endorsed the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to join the party./nIn April 2021, Dawkins said on Twitter that \"In 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as Black. Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss.\" After receiving criticism for this tweet, Dawkins responded by saying that \"I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic \"Discuss\" question has been misconstrued as such and I deplore this. It was also not my intent to ally in any way with Republican bigots in US now exploiting this issue.\"[158] The American Humanist Association retracted Dawkins' 1996 Humanist of the Year Award in response to these comments.[159] Robby Soave of Reason magazine criticized the retraction, saying that \"The drive to punish dissenters from various orthodoxies is itself illiberal.\"[160]/nDawkins has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation that campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.[161]/nDawkins identifies as a feminist.[162] He has said that feminism is \"enormously important\".[163] Dawkins has been accused by writers such as Amanda Marcotte, Caitlin Dickson, and Adam Lee of misogyny, criticizing those who speak about sexual harassment and abuse while ignoring sexism within the New Atheist movement.[164][165][166]/nIn 1998, in a book review published in Nature, Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books connected with the Sokal affair, Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt and Intellectual Impostures by Sokal and Jean Bricmont. These books are famous for their criticism of postmodernism in U.S. universities (namely in the departments of literary studies, anthropology, and other cultural studies).[167]/nEchoing many critics, Dawkins holds that postmodernism uses obscurantist language to hide its lack of meaningful content. As an example he quotes the psychoanalyst F\u00e9lix Guattari: \"We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis.\" This is explained, Dawkins maintains, by certain intellectuals' academic ambitions. Figures like Guattari or Lacan, according to Dawkins, have nothing to say but want to reap the benefits of reputation and fame that derive from a successful academic career: \"Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content.\"[167]/nIn his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book Unweaving the Rainbow considers John Keats's accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life's evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do \"myths\" and \"pseudoscience\".[168] For John Diamond's posthumously published Snake Oil, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes.[169] Dawkins states that \"There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work.\"[170] In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film The Enemies of Reason, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by \"an epidemic of superstitious thinking\".[171]/nContinuing a long-standing partnership with Channel 4, Dawkins participated in a five-part television series, Genius of Britain, along with fellow scientists Stephen Hawking, James Dyson, Paul Nurse, and Jim Al-Khalili. The series was first broadcast in June 2010, and focuses on major, British, scientific achievements throughout history.[172]/nIn 2014, he joined the global awareness movement Asteroid Day as a \"100x Signatory\".[173]/nHe holds honorary doctorates in science from the University of Huddersfield, University of Westminster, Durham University,[174] the University of Hull, the University of Antwerp, the University of Oslo, the University of Aberdeen,[175] Open University, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel,[27] and the University of Valencia.[176] He also holds honorary doctorates of letters from the University of St Andrews and the Australian National University (HonLittD, 1996), and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997 and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001.[1][27] He is one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society./nIn 1987, Dawkins received a Royal Society of Literature award and a Los Angeles Times Literary Prize for his book The Blind Watchmaker. In the same year, he received a Sci. Tech Prize for Best Television Documentary Science Programme of the Year for his work on the BBC's Horizon episode The Blind Watchmaker.[27]/nIn 1996, the American Humanist Association gave him their Humanist of the Year Award, but the award was withdrawn in 2021, with the statement that he \"demean[ed] marginalized groups\", including transgender people, using \"the guise of scientific discourse\".[177][158]/nOther awards include the Zoological Society of London's Silver Medal (1989), the Finlay Innovation Award (1990), the Michael Faraday Award (1990), the Nakayama Prize (1994), the fifth International Cosmos Prize (1997), the Kistler Prize (2001), the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic (2001), the 2001 and 2012 Emperor Has No Clothes Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Bicentennial Kelvin Medal of The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow (2002),[27] the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2006),[178] and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest (2009).[179] He was awarded the Deschner Award, named after German anti-clerical author Karlheinz Deschner.[180] The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) has awarded Dawkins their highest award In Praise of Reason (1992).[181]/nDawkins topped Prospect magazine's 2004 list of the top 100 public British intellectuals, as decided by the readers, receiving twice as many votes as the runner-up.[182][183] He was shortlisted as a candidate in their 2008 follow-up poll.[184] In a poll held by Prospect in 2013, Dawkins was voted the world's top thinker based on 65 names chosen by a largely US and UK-based expert panel.[185]/nIn 2005, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded him its Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his \"concise and accessible presentation of scientific knowledge\". He won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science for 2006, as well as the Galaxy British Book Awards's Author of the Year Award for 2007.[186] In the same year, he was listed by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007,[187] and was ranked 20th in The Daily Telegraph's 2007 list of 100 greatest living geniuses.[188]/nSince 2003, the Atheist Alliance International has awarded a prize during its annual conference, honouring an outstanding atheist whose work has done the most to raise public awareness of atheism during that year; it is known as the Richard Dawkins Award, in honour of Dawkins's own efforts.[189] In February 2010, Dawkins was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers.[190]/nIn 2012, a Sri Lankan team of ichthyologists headed by Rohan Pethiyagoda named a new genus of freshwater fish Dawkinsia in Dawkins's honor.

On 19 August 1967, Dawkins married ethologist Marian Stamp in the Protestant church in Annestown, County Waterford, Ireland;[192] they divorced in 1984. On 1 June 1984, he married Eve Barham (1951\u20131999) in Oxford. They had a daughter. Dawkins and Barham divorced.[193] In 1992, he married actress Lalla Ward[193] in Kensington and Chelsea, London. Dawkins met her through their mutual friend Douglas Adams,[194] who had worked with her on the BBC's Doctor Who. Dawkins and Ward separated in 2016 and they later described the separation as \"entirely amicable\".[195] He identifies as an atheist who is a \"cultural Anglican\", associated with the Church of England, and a \"secular Christian\".[196][197][198][199] On 6 February 2016, Dawkins suffered a minor haemorrhagic stroke while at home.[200][201] Dawkins reported later that same year that he had almost completely recovered.[202][203]/nDawkins has made many television appearances on news shows providing his political opinions and especially his views as an atheist. He has been interviewed on the radio, often as part of his book tours. He has debated many religious figures. He has made many university speaking appearances, again often in coordination with his book tours. As of 2016, he has over 60 credits in the Internet Movie Database where he appeared as himself:/na. ^ W. D.

This was a problem they had experienced since the company's founding in 1822. William Lyman decided late that year to visit MIT for assistance with this problem./nUnderwood approached William Thompson Sedgwick, the chair of the biology department at MIT about the concerns he had with the recent product swells and explosion of clams. Sedgwick then summoned his assistant Samuel Cate Prescott and apprised him on the issue. From late 1895 to late 1896, Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon, focusing on canned clams. They first discovered that the clams contained some heat-resistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment; and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250\u02daF (121\u02daC) for ten minutes in a retort./nThese studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster, sardines, peas, tomatoes, corn, and spinach.

This research, though important to the growth of food technology, was never patented./nDuring the research process, Underwood provided photomicrographic images of the bacteria that were involved in the research, which were magnified 650 times in 1896. A later research article in 1898 showed photography of bacteria magnified 1,000 times./nThis research proved beneficial to the William Underwood Company, the canning industry, the food industry, and food technology itself. Underwood retired from the William Underwood Company in 1899 to devote himself entirely to bacteriology studies at MIT. He would work at MIT without pay. This research and friendship with Prescott would continue until Underwood's death in 1929./nIn the late 1950s, the new president of the William Underwood Company, George Seybolt, was brought over by his predecessor, W.

Hunter Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Jones holds an adjunct position at University of California, San Diego.[4] She has worked extensively on understanding the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).[5] She investigated several proteins that interact with HIV-Tat (Tat).[6] Tat is a protein created by HIV, which has been described as an \"engine for HIV replication\".[7] Jones identified several proteins (including Cyclin T1, CycT1, and SSu72) that are required for HIV gene expression.[8] SSu72 is a phosphatase that binds to Tat and speeds up the transcription process that replicates the virus.[6] Unfortunately, CycT1 is needed for normal cell function, so is not an ideal target for antivirals.[6]/nJones looks to create small molecule inhibitors that restrict these proteins.[1] She identified that the small molecule JIB-04 is particularly effective in destroying Tat. She used DIFFpop to identify the protein targets of JIB-04. DIFFpop revealed that JIB-04 decreases the levels of Tat because it binds together two enzymes in the host cell, SHMT2 and BRCC36, which subsequently enable the cells to destroy Tat.[9] At present JIB-04 is too toxic to primary T-cells, but Jones and colleagues are working on investigations of other small molecules that can still inhibit Tat expression.[9]/nJones demonstrated that in colon cancer, the mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) regulates the expression of genes which control cancer growth.[10] She demonstrated that APC cannot turn off growth control genes as it cannot bind to a protein that presents metastasis.[11] She has gone on to show that transcription elongation is involved with the differentiation of stem cells. It is well known that wnt and activin pathways are needed for stem cell growth, but it was unclear how they work together. Jones showed how they work together to activate transcription. She also demonstrated that activation of the wnt signaling pathway can result in colon cancer.[12] During their investigations of embryonic stem cells, Jones identified a third pathway, YAP, which slows the activin pathway and stops stem cells from specialising.[13] She used CRISPR-cas9 to remove the genes that make the YAP protein, reducing the number of steps to convert embryonic stem cells into functional heart cells.[13][14]/nShe has also studied the CDK12 gene, which is mutated in 3 - 5% of prostate, ovarian and breast cancers.[15] The majority of cancers that contain a mutated CDK12 gene are not responsive to immunotherapy, so creating inhibitors of CDK12 could make cancers more treatable.[15] When CDK12 is inhibited cells cannot repair DNA and the cells are more likely to die during chemotherapy.[15]/nIn 2017 Jones filed a lawsuit against the Salk Institute for Biological Studies for gender discrimination, citing that their work had not been recognised their labs were small and they received less funding.[16][17] She claimed that imagery of women faculty members was used in Salk Institute promotional material to secure funding from donors.[16] Jones settled her case in August 2018.[18][19]", "1664375": "Nettie Maria Stevens (July 7, 1861 \u2013 May 4, 1912)[1] was an American geneticist who discovered sex chromosomes.

She continued there as reader in experimental morphology for another year and worked at Bryn Mawr as an associate in experimental morphology from 1905 until her death.[5]  She was offered the position she had long sought, as research professor at Bryn Mawr College, just before cancer took her life. She was unable to accept the offer due to her ill health.[2][5]/nAfter receiving her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr, Stevens was awarded a research assistantship at the Carnegie Institute of Washington in 1904\u20131905. Stevens' post-doctoral year of work at the Carnegie Institution required fellowship support, and both Wilson and Morgan wrote recommendations on her behalf.  She applied for funding for research on heredity related to Mendel's laws,[2]  specifically sex determination.  After receiving the grant, she used germ cells of aphids to examine possible differences in chromosome sets between the two sexes. One paper, written in 1905,[6]  won Stevens an award of $1,000 [2] for the best scientific paper written by a woman. Her major sex determination work was published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the two part monograph, \"Studies in Spermatogenesis,\" [7]  which highlighted her increasingly promising focus of sex-determination studies and chromosomal inheritance.[2]  In 1908, Stevens received the Alice Freeman Palmer Fellowship from the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, now the American Association of University Women.[8]  During that fellowship year, Stevens again conducted research at the Naples Zoological Station and the University of W\u00fcrzburg, in addition to visiting laboratories throughout Europe.[9]/nStevens was one of the first American women to be recognized for her contribution to science. Most of her research was completed at Bryn Mawr College. The highest rank she attained was Associate in Experimental Morphology (1905\u20131912).[5] At Bryn Mawr, she expanded the fields of genetics, cytology, and embryology.[2]/nAlthough Stevens did not have a university position, she made a career for herself by conducting research at leading marine stations and laboratories. Her record of 38 publications includes several major contributions that further the emerging concepts of chromosomal heredity. By experimenting on germ cells, Stevens interpreted her data to conclude that chromosomes have a role in sex determination during development. As a result of her research, Stevens provided critical evidence for Mendelian and chromosomal theories of inheritance.[2]/nUsing observations of insect chromosomes, Stevens discovered that, in some species, chromosomes are different between the sexes and when chromosome segregation occurs in sperm formation, this difference leads to outcomes of female versus male progeny. Her discovery was the first time that observable differences of chromosomes could be linked to an observable difference in phenotype or physical attributes (i.e., whether an individual is male or female). This work was published in 1905.[6] Her continuing experiments used a range of insects.[7] She identified the small chromosome currently known as the Y chromosome in the mealworm Tenebrio. She deduced that the chromosomal basis of sex depended on the smaller Y chromosome carried by the male. An egg fertilized by a sperm that carries the small chromosome becomes a male while an egg fertilized by a sperm with the larger chromosome becomes female.[7]  Studying egg tissue and the fertilization process in aphids, mealworms, beetles, and flies, Stevens saw that there were chromosomes that existed in small-large pairs (now known as XY chromosome pairs) and she also saw chromosomes that were unpaired, XO.[2][7] Hermann Henking had studied firebug chromosomes earlier and noticed the chromosome now called X, but didn't find the small chromosome now called Y.  Stevens realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the small (Y) chromosome.[2][10][11] Stevens did not name the chromosomes X or Y. Their current names came later.[12][13]  Edmund Wilson worked on spermatogenesis preparations simultaneously with Stevens' studies.[14]  He performed cytological examination only on the testes, that is he did not examine the female germ cells (eggs) but only the male germ cells (sperm) in his studies.  His paper stated that eggs were too fatty for his staining procedures. After reading the papers describing Stevens' discoveries, Wilson reissued his original paper and in a footnote acknowledged Stevens for the finding of sex chromosomes.[2]/nAt Bryn Mawr, following her 1905\u201306 publications, Stevens bred and studied Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies in the laboratory.  She worked with these as subjects of her research for some years before Morgan adopted them as his model organism.[15]/nAlthough Stevens and Wilson both worked on chromosomal sex determination, many authors have credited Wilson alone for the discovery.[2] Additionally, Thomas Hunt Morgan has been credited with the discovery of sex chromosomes although at the time of these cytological discoveries, he argued against Wilson's and Stevens' interpretations.  Morgan's recognition came in part from his work on sex linkage of the white mutant gene of fruit flies and was especially heightened by his Nobel Prize award in 1933. Stevens was not even recognized immediately after her discovery.  For example, Morgan and Wilson were invited to speak at a conference to present their theories on sex determination in 1906 but Stevens was not invited to speak.[2]/nFollowing Nettie Stevens' death, Thomas Hunt Morgan wrote an extensive obituary for the journal Science.[16] In that article, Morgan said she had \"a share in a discovery of importance.\u201d [16] He continued in the obituary to describe in some detail the implications of this work. However, Morgan also claimed that she had confirmed McClung's hypothesis about sex chromosomes [16] when she actually refuted his main claim that the larger (X) chromosome determined sex.[7] Morgan recognized Wilson's parallel but less complete and convincing studies [14] as producing a \"joint discovery\" with Stevens.[16] But Wilson said in a later footnote that she made the discovery.[9][12]  Also, Morgan claimed Stevens seemed to \"appear at times wanting in that sort of inspiration that utilizes the plain fact of discovery for wider vision.\u201d [16]  Apparently, Morgan was forgetting the fact that she was often excluded from scientific dialogue, for example she was not invited to speak at the meetings where he and Wilson expounded the theory of sex chromosomes.[2] In his textbook, The Mechanism of Genetics, published in 1915, he did not credit either Stevens or Wilson with the discovery of sex chromosomes.[17]  He described sex linkage of the white gene in the chapter immediately before the one in which he described Stevens' results without mentioning her name, implying that his own laboratory's sex linkage analysis was the basis on which one should understand sex determination. In an earlier letter of recommendation he wrote, \"Of the graduate students that I have had during the last twelve years I have had no-one that was as capable and independent in research as Miss Stevens.\"[10]/nAt 50 years old, and only 9 years after completing her Ph.D., Stevens died of breast cancer on May 4, 1912, in Baltimore, Maryland. Her career span was short, but she published approximately 40 papers.[15] She never married and had no children.[18] She was buried in the Westford, Massachusetts cemetery alongside the graves of her father, Ephraim, and her sister, Emma.[11][19]/nHer single-mindedness and devotion, combined with keen powers of observation; her thoughtfulness and patience, united to a well-balanced judgment, account, in part, for her remarkable accomplishment./nModern cytological work involves an intricacy of detail, the significance of which can be appreciated by the specialist alone; but Miss Stevens had a share in a discovery of importance, and her work will be remembered for this, when the minutiae of detailed investigations that she carried out have become incorporated in the general body of the subject./nIn 1994, Stevens was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[21]/nTo celebrate her 155th birthday, on July 7, 2016, Google created a doodle showing Stevens peering through a microscope at XY chromosomes./nOn May 5, 2017, Westfield State University honored Stevens through the naming ceremony of the Dr. Nettie Maria Stevens Science and Innovation Center. The center is where the university's STEM-related degree programs in Nursing and Allied Health, Chemical and Physical Sciences, Biology, Environmental Science and the then soon-to-be launched master's degree program in Physician Assistant Studies are all based.[22]", "51930500": "Kalappa Muniyappa (born 8 September 1952) is an Indian molecular biologist and geneticist, known for his researches on the chromatization of DNA and gene targeting.[1] He is a professor and chairman of the department of biochemistry of the Indian Institute of Science[2] and an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, India.[3] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1995, for his contributions to biological sciences.[4]/nBorn on 2 February 1951 in the South Indian state of Karnataka, Kalappa Muniyappa, after graduating in science from Mysore University in 1974, secured his master's degree in 1976 from the same university with first rank.[3] His doctoral degree came from the Indian Institute of Science in 1980 after which he did his post-doctoral studies (1981\u201386) at the University of Georgia and at Yale University School of Medicine[5] and returned to India in 1987 to join the Indian Institute of Science the next year as a member of faculty.

Hall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1999.[1]/nHall was born in Barnsley in Yorkshire. He earned his BA in chemistry from Oxford University. He began his studies for a PhD at Oxford, but after two months he followed his major professor Jeremy R. Knowles to Harvard University, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry in 1977.[2] He then took postdoctoral fellowships in molecular biology at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Zurich.[3]/nHall's PhD was on the enzymology of B-lactamase, which led to his first paper being published in Nature in 1976. He used strains of E. Coli with mutated B-lactamase, an antibiotic resistance enzyme, and assayed their activity in the presence of Benzylpenicillin and Cephalosporin C. Direct selection on these mutants allowed catalytic properties of B-lactamase to be identified and allowed structure-function relationships of the enzyme to be further researched.[4]/nIn 1981 he went to work at Institute for Cancer Research in London, where he stayed for 12 years. His work, in collaboration with his colleague and close friend Christopher Marshall, made seminal contributions to our understanding of cell signalling in animal cells, in particular the role of Rho and Ras small GTPases in regulating a variety of cellular functions such as proliferation, morphology and migration. In 1982, Hall helped identify transforming sequences in human sarcoma cells lines at the Institute for Cancer Research in London. DNA from a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and a fibrosarcoma cell line transformed a NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line. After injection into mice, tumors started to form in as little as 10 days. Next, the transforming activities of the rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines were measured after being digested with an array of endonucleases. Further DNA testing showed that the transforming sequences in the two cancer cell lines were the same, and the gene was later characterised as N-ras, a member of the Ras gene family.[5]/nIn 1986, Hall helped uncover properties of the human p21 protein, which is encoded by N-ras. GTPase activity of different mutant forms of p21, one cloned from a patient with myeloblastic leukaemia and one derived from in vitro mutagenesis, was measured. Results showed no correlation between the wild-type or mutant N-ras p21's GTPase activity and transforming potential. These findings were published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB).[6]/nAlan Hall showed the specificity of Rho in the stimulation of focal adhesions and stress fibres formation in fibroblasts in the presence of extracellular factors in 1992. He first realised that the addition of bovine fetal calf serum (FCS) to Swiss 3T3 cells increased the polymerisation of actin and assembly of stress fibres. The immunofluorescence following the increase of vinculin and talin, two cytoskeletal proteins, at the intracellular face of the plasma membrane with Val14rhoA microinjection showed the association of focal adhesions with the end of the new stress fibres. After size fractionation of FCS and analysis of the lipids that bound to serum albumin, the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was found to be responsible for the serum activity that induced stress fibre formation. The inhibition of Rho by C3 transferase ribosylation resulted in an inhibition of focal adhesion and stress fibre assembly, but had no effect on membrane ruffling. These findings were published in Cell and cited over 4000 times.[7] In parallel with this experiment, Hall showed that the presence of Rac, another Ras-related GTP-binding protein, is implicated in the regulation of the actin organisation in presence of extracellular growth factors. Immunofluorescence and antibody techniques were used to localise the mutant V12rac1 protein after being microinjected into the cytoplasm of confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. The comparison with the normal cells showed that Rac1 stimulates actin filament production at the membrane, pinocytosis, and membrane ruffling. The inhibition of endogenous Rac function by mutants N17rac and V12rac1 prevented growth factor-induced membrane ruffling. In addition, the inactivation of Rho protein by ADP-ribosylation in Rac1 microinjection reduced the formation of actin stress fibres. Hall concluded that Rac and Rho are complementary for polymerised actin organisation. Indeed, Rho-dependent response is stimulated by the action of growth factors on Rac protein.[8]/nIn 1993 he moved to University College London, where he helped to create a new MRC centre for molecular cell biology. In 2000, he became director of that program./nIn 2002, Alan Hall discerned the role of Gaq in Rho signalling pathways. Prior to this publication, there were conflicting reports as to the role of Gaq in cell signalling via Rho; some said that it was not able to induce Rho activation, and some said that it could. Using immunoblotting techniques, Hall showed that activation of endogenous Gaq via G protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs) could in fact induce activation of Rho, and had similar results when directly expressing activated Gaq. It was already known that other Ga proteins could induce Rho activation (i.e. Ga13 activates p115 Rho GEF, which in turn activates Rho), but it was also known that Gaq does not activate p115 Rho GEF, and therefore must act via an alternate, unknown mechanism.[9] Two years later, he moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as chair of the cell biology program.[3]/nIn 2005, there was an abundance of activators and targets of the Rho pathway that had been identified, yet very little investigation into the way in which specificity of the pathway is maintained. It was known at this point that several identified Rho targets were structurally similar to scaffold proteins, which have been shown in the past to mediate interaction specificity in other pathways. Hall used immunoprecipitation assays to show that CNK1, a scaffold protein-like target of Rho, interacts with two Rho-specific GEFs (Net1 and p115RhoGEF) and two kinases of the JNK MAP kinase pathway (MLK2 and MKK7). He then determined that CNK1 acts together with these four targets to activate the JNK MAP kinase pathway, but not other Rho-activated pathways. This led to the conclusion that CNK1 couples specific Rho exchange factors to the JNK MAP kinase pathway, providing specificity.[10] In the same year, Hall investigated the role of the small GTPase Ral in neurite branching. After microinjection of cortical and sympathetic neurons with active and dominant-negative Ral, the staining of the cells with antibodies showed that the increases in neurite branching was directly linked to the presence of active Ral. Further evidence of the importance of Ral was provided when cortical neurons were depleted of endogenous RalA and RalB isoforms by RNA interference (RNAi) and showed a decrease in the branching. By plating SCG on plastic dishes in presence of different substrates, Hall realised that Ral was activated by laminin to induce this branching. In fact, Ral-dependent branching implicated the phosphorylation of growth-associated protein GAP-43. Finally, Ral mutants unable to bind to their specific effector proteins showed that RalA and RalB isoforms promote branching through exocyst complex and phospholipase D respectively.[11]/nIn 2010, Hall analysed a number of Rho signalling pathways, which regulate the formation of apical junctions in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. Downregulation of RhoA in the HBE cell lines using siRNAs showed a lack of apical junction formation in contrast with the controls. The siRNAs that targeted RhoA had no effect on other members of the Rho family. Further analysis showed that PRK2, a direct target of Rho, is required for the formation of apical junctions. Mutational variants of PRK2 were used to discover that although initial formation of pre-apical junctions isn't blocked, the maturation process into true apical junctions is prevented.[12]/nHall's research has had wide implications across human health and disease, particularly cancer. In addition, a generation of cell biologists was educated and trained under his supervision across two continents./nIn 1993, Alan Hall was awarded the Feldberg Foundation Prize for his work on the role GTP-binding proteins played on signal transduction pathways.[13] His work in 2005 on the regulation of adhesion, migration and polarity of the cell cytoskeleton was awarded the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine.[14] Later that year he won the Novartis Medal[15] for his work with Rho GTPases role in cell behaviour.[16] The Canada Gairdner International Award (2006) was awarded to him for the discovery of Rho GTPases that play a role in cytoskeleton arrangement and cell migration and its application to cancerous cells.[17]", "48555398": "Hildred Mary Butler (9 October 1906 \u2013 8 April 1975) was an Australian microbiologist.[1]/nThe daughter of Archie Butler, a farmer, and Rose Josephine Hancock, his wife, she was born in Elsternwick, Melbourne and was educated at Lauriston Girls' School, going on to earn a BSc and DSc from the University of Melbourne.[2] From 1928 to 1938, she was bacteriologist for the Baker Medical Research Institute.

identification of lice as the transmitter of epidemic typhus./nNicolle was born to Aline Louvrier and Eug\u00e8ne Nicolle in Rouen, France and was raised as part of a middle-class family that valued education.[2] He had two other siblings \u2013 his older brother, Maurice Nicolle (a medical microbiologist, professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Director of the Bacteriological Institute of Constantinople), and his younger brother, Marcel Nicolle (an art critic).[2][1][3]/nNicole later married Alice Avice in 1895 and had two children, Marcelle (b. 1896) and Pierre (b. 1898), both of whom also went on to enter the medical field.[1][3]/nThe earliest educational influences on Nicolle were from his father, a doctor at a Rouen hospital.[2][1] Nicolle later received his education from the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille in Rouen, followed by his medical degree from the Pasteur Institute of Paris in 1893.[3][4] At this point he returned to Rouen, as a member of the Medical Faculty until 1896 and then as Director of the Bacteriological Laboratory from 1896 to 1902.[1][3] Around this time, Nicolle also became deaf in one ear, which both limited his ability to continue clinical practice and simultaneously encouraged him to pursue academic research as an alternate career.[2][1] He did just that in 1903, when he became Director of the Pasteur Institute in Tunis and conducted his Nobel Prize-winning work on typhus, bringing H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Sparrow with him as laboratory chief.[3][5] He was still director of the Institute when he died in 1936.[3]/nBefore Nicolle took on the position of leading the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, the Pasteur Institute in Paris remained the predominant centre for research in France as it aimed to combine medical research, teaching, and public service (treatment of diseases) under Pastorian missionary principles.[6] However, under Nicolle\u2019s guidance over the next 33 years, the 'sister' Institute in Tunis quickly became an international centre of its own for the production of vaccines used against infectious diseases and for medical research.[3][6]/nNicolle\u2019s success in expanding the Pasteur Institute in Tunis lies primarily in his deviation from the traditional pastorian ideology that mandated that medical aid and research be done in a nonprofit manner.[6] Nicolle instead actively sought to build relations with the local Tunisian and French healthcare officials and organized the Institute such that other medical functions (such as caring for sick patients) would monetarily support the Institute's ongoing laboratory research.[6] Doing so gave him autonomy to run the Institute without relying on public or governmental funds.[6] As the Institute grew more financially stable, Nicolle tackled the diseases and public health concerns that were prevalent in the local region, shared research findings and resources with the Paris Institute, and expanded his scientific writings into a journal called the Archives de l\u2019Institut de Tunis.[6] He also became a key point of contact for the French government when new epidemics arose that required his intervention \u2013 such as in the malaria epidemic of 1906 and the cholera outbreak of 1907.[6]/nDuring this time, Nicolle also undertook two major projects that would come to define his role in the scientific community\u00a0\u2013 the discovery of the mode of transmission of typhus (an infectious disease prevalent throughout North Africa and the Mediterranean Basin at that time) and the production of vaccines.[2][6]/nNicolle's discovery came about first from his observation that, while epidemic typhus patients were able to infect other patients inside and outside the hospital, and their very clothes seemed to spread the disease, they were no longer infectious when they had had a hot bath and a change of clothes.[6] Once he realized this, he reasoned that it was most likely that lice were the vector for epidemic typhus.[6]/nBecause studying the transmission of typhus required that the parasite be alive (needed a human host), scientists were only able to study it during epidemic times.[6] However, Nicolle found that the chimpanzee served as a suitable alternate host for this study since it was genetically similar to humans, and in June 1909, Nicolle tested his theory by infecting a chimpanzee with typhus, retrieving the lice from it, and placing it on a healthy chimpanzee.[3][6][7] Within 10 days, the second chimpanzee had typhus as well.[3][6][8] After repeating his experiment, he was sure of it: lice were the carriers.[3][6] As Nicolle continued his ongoing research on the disease, he later switched to using guinea pigs as his model organism instead of chimpanzees as they were just as susceptible to infection and were also smaller and cheaper.[3][6]/nAn important finding from further research showed that the major transmission method was not louse bites but excrement: lice infected with typhus turn red and die after a couple of weeks, but in the meantime, they excrete a large number of microbes.[3][8] When a small quantity of this is rubbed on the skin or eye, an infection occurs.[3]/nNicolle\u2019s work was not only influential in containing the typhus epidemics that occurred in the region but also helped scientists distinguish the typhus fever caused by lice from murine typhus, which is transmitted by fleas.[3]/nNicolle surmised that he could make a simple vaccine by crushing up the lice and mixing it with blood serum from recovered patients.[8] He first tried this vaccine on himself, and when he stayed healthy he tried it on a few children (because of their better immune systems), who developed typhus but recovered.[8]/nHe did not succeed in his effort to develop a practical vaccine. The next step would be taken by Rudolf Weigl in 1930.[8]/nDespite being unable to develop a vaccination against typhus, Nicolle did make several other key discoveries in the field of vaccination.[6] He was the first to determine that sodium fluoride was a good reagent to sterilize parasites (so that they are no longer infectious) while also preserving their structure (to use in vaccines).[6] Using this method, he developed vaccines for gonorrhea, some staphylococcal infections, and cholera.[6] These vaccines were not only used throughout France but were also sent worldwide.[6]/nNicolle's major accomplishments in bacteriology and parasitology were:/nDuring his life Nicolle wrote a number of non-fiction and bacteriology books, including:/nHe also wrote fiction and philosophy throughout his life, including:/nBaptized a Catholic, Nicolle left the faith when he was twelve. Starting in 1934, he felt spiritual anxiety, and he was reconciled with the Church in August 1935 after communicating with a Jesuit priest.[1][9]", "69330348": "David Harris Cohen is an American neuroscientist, physiologist, and academic administrator.

He was good friends with Stanford University professor of entomology Vernon Lyman Kellogg who also lived in Carmel.[23][24]/nIn 1899, Jordan delivered an essay at Stanford on behalf of racial segregation and racial purity.[25] In the essay, Jordan claimed that \"For a race of men or a herd of cattle are governed by the same laws of selection.\" Jordan expressed great fears and phobias for \"race degeneration\" that would result unless great endeavors were put forward to maintain \"racial unity\"./nOne of Jordan's main theses in the essay was that his goals for an ideal society are better engendered by peace than war. His argument against warfare contended that it is detrimental because it removes the strongest men from the gene pool.[26][27][28] Jordan asserted, \"Future war is impossible because the nations cannot afford it.\"[29] As one commentator put it, \"Though he found meager evidence to support his preconceptions, he still confidently asserted that 'always and everywhere, war means the reversal of natural selection.'\"[3]:\u200a79/nJordan was president of the World Peace Foundation from 1910 to 1914 and president of the World Peace Conference in 1915 and initially opposed American entry into World War I[18] although he changed his position in 1917 after he became convinced that a German victory would threaten democracy.[3]/nSoon after it was first delivered, the essay was published by the American Unitarian Association (copyright 1902) under the main title of \"The Blood of the Nation\" and a subtitle of \"A Study of the Decay of Races Through the Survival of the Unfit\". Multiple editions of that version followed over the next few years.[30]/nAn expanded version of the essay was delivered in Philadelphia at the 200th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's birth in 1906 and printed by the American Philosophical Society. The following year, an expanded version of the original essay with an embossed cover was published by Beacon Press in Boston under the new main title \"The Human Harvest\" and the same subtitle.[31] This new version was dedicated to Jordan's older brother Rufus, who had volunteered to fight in the American Civil War and, according to Jordan, was part of the \"'Human Harvest' of 1862\".  Jordan's eugenic and anti-war views may have been in part shaped by the death of his brother in 1862 from a 'camp fever', likely typhoid, immediately after enlisting to fight in the American civil war.[32]/nIn 1910, the original and slimmer version of the essay was again published by the American Unitarian Association in a \"present less expensive form to insure the widest possible distribution.\"[33]/nIn 1915, Jordan published an \"extended treatise on the same subject\" titled War and Breed and again through the Beacon Press in Boston.[34] Here Jordan defines and begins to employ the relatively recent term \"eugenics\" and its opposite \"dysgenics\".[35]/nIn 1928 Jordan served on the initial board of trustees of the Human Betterment Foundation, a eugenics organization that advocated compulsory sterilization legislation in the United States.[36][37] He then chaired the first Committee on Eugenics of the American Breeder's Association from which the California program of forced deportation and sterilization emerged.[38] Jordan then went on to help found the Human Betterment Foundation as a trustee. The foundation published Sterilization for Human Betterment./nIn 1905, Jordan launched an apparent coverup of the murder of Jane Stanford. While vacationing in Oahu, Stanford had suddenly died of strychnine poisoning according to the local coroner's jury. Jordan then sailed to Hawaii, hired a physician to investigate the case, and declared she had in fact died of heart failure, a condition whose symptoms bear no relationship to those that were actually observed.[39][40] His motive for doing this has been a subject of speculation. One possibility is that he was simply acting to protect the reputation of the university[39][41] since its finances were precarious, and a scandal might have damaged fundraising. He had written the president of Stanford's board of trustees, offered several alternate explanations for Mrs. Stanford's death, and suggested to select whichever would be most suitable.[39] Since Mrs. Stanford had a difficult relationship with him and reportedly planned to remove him from his position at the university, he might also have had a personal motive to eliminate suspicions that might have swirled around an unsolved crime.[42] Jordan's version of Mrs. Stanford's demise[43] was largely accepted until the appearance of several publications in 2003 that emphasized the evidence that she was murdered.[39][41][42][44]/nIn retirement, Jordan remained active, writing on ichthyology, world relations, peace, and his autobiography.[18]/nAlthough a proponent of eugenics, Jordan was skeptical of certain other pseudoscientific claims. He coined the term \"sciosophy\" to describe the \"systematized ignorance\" of the pseudoscientist.[50][51] His later work, The Higher Foolishness, inspired the philosopher Martin Gardner to write his treatise on scientific skepticism, Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science.[50] However, Gardner noted that \"the book is infuriating because although Jordan mentions the titles of dozens of crank works, from which he quotes extensively, he seldom tells you the names of the authors.\"[50]/nHis daughters Thora (1884\u20131886) and Barbara (1891\u20131900) died in childhood.[52]/nHis son, Eric Knight Jordan (1903\u20131926), died at 22 in a traffic accident near Gilroy, California.[53][54] Eric had participated in a paleontological expedition to the Revillagigedo Islands and was considering an academic career.[55]/nOn September 19, 1931, Jordan died at his home on the Stanford campus after he had suffered a series of strokes over two years.[56]/nIn July 2020, the president of the Sierra Club denounced Jordan and its other early leaders for being \"vocal advocates for white supremacy and its pseudo-scientific arm, eugenics.\" The president also announced, \"We will also spend the next year studying our history and determining which of our monuments need to be renamed or pulled down entirely.\" It is not yet clear how their reassessment would affect the status of Mount Jordan, which the club had helped to name in 1926, or that of other geographic features that bear Jordan's name.[60]/nThe David Starr Jordan \"Namesake Tree\" at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa Campus Arboretum, an Indian rubber tree (Ficus elastica) was given to Jordan at the outset of a trip to Japan, and planted by him on December 11, 1922,[61] now listed as an Exceptional Tree of Hawai\u2018i.[62]/nIn 1966, the fisheries research ship David Starr Jordan was commissioned for service with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The ship later served in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fleet as NOAAS David Starr Jordan (R 444)[63] before it was decommissioned in 2010[64] and sold to a private company, who renamed it the R/V Ocean Starr.[65]/nDuring the 20th century several schools were named after him or in his honor. However, most of them were renamed in the 21st century, as his eugenics activities became well known./nJordan was closely associated with Indiana University and Stanford University, and both schools named buildings and other campus features after him. However, as his reputation became more controversial in the 2000s, they acted to remove Jordan's name from their respective campuses./nStanford honored its former president in 1917 by renaming its zoology building, built in 1899, to Jordan Hall.[76] Other campus features were named Jordan Quad, Jordan Modulars, and Jordan Way. In October 2020 the Stanford Board of Trustees voted unanimously, on the recommendation of an advisory committee, to remove Jordan's name from all four facilities. The former Jordan Hall was to be referred to as Building 420 until a permanent name could be selected sometime the following year. Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne was charged to rename Jordan Quad and Jordan Modulars. The advisory committee recommended that the renaming of Jordan Way, a street on the medical campus, \"may take place during the course of ongoing construction and planning.\"[77][78][79]/nWhen Indiana University built a new building for its biology department in 1956, the building was named in honor of Jordan, its former president and biology faculty member.[80][81][82] In October 2020 the Indiana University Board of Trustees voted overwhelmingly to remove Jordan's name from the biology building as well as a parking garage and a \"river\" (actually a small creek) that runs through the center of the campus. Jordan's name was stripped from these places immediately after the trustee meeting had concluded, and they were given temporary, generic names to be used until permanent names could be selected the following year. Jordan Hall, the Jordan River and the Jordan Avenue Parking Garage became respectively the Biology Building, the Campus River, and the East Parking Garage.[83][84][85] In August 2021, staff members of the Biology Department sent a petition to the new IU President Pamela Whitten urging the university leadership to rename the Biology Building in honor of James P. Holland, an African-American IU alumnus, award-winning former faculty member and endocrinologist who died in 1998.[86][87]/nIU President Michael McRobbie requested the University Naming Committee to work with the city of Bloomington to find a name as a replacement for Jordan Avenue, a thoroughfare that is owned in part by IU and in part by the city.[88] As of October 2020[update], there were calls in the Bloomington City Council for Jordan Avenue to be renamed.[89] In April 2021, the Mayor of Bloomington created a seven-member task force to investigate possible replacement names for Jordan Avenue.[90] In September 2021, the City of Bloomington Plan Commission announced that it approved the renaming of Jordan Avenue to Eagleson Avenue while IU is in the process of renaming its section of the street to Fuller Lane pending approval by the IU Renaming Committee and IU's board of trustees. The city planned to complete their street renaming by February 2022. Both new street names honor prominent African-American families who moved to Bloomington after being born into slavery.[91] In December 2021, IU's board of trustees reconsidered their decision to rename the university's section of the street as Fuller Lane by adopting Eagleson Avenue as the new name for the University-owned section of Jordan Avenue.[92][93]/nAs of September\u00a02021[update], the Indiana University South Bend campus has a scholarship named in honor of Jordan that enables its students to study outside of the United States for a short period.[94]/nStarting in 1986, the David Starr Jordan Prize was funded as a joint endowment by Cornell University, Indiana University, and Stanford. Every three years it was awarded to a young scientist (under 40 years) who made contributions in one of Jordan's interests of evolution, ecology, population or organismal biology.[95] The prize was last awarded in 2015 to a biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin.[96]/nAs Jordan's reputation became more controversial due to his support of eugenics, and particularly after the removal of Jordan's name from buildings on the campuses of Stanford and Indiana universities in 2020, there were calls to rename the prize. The prize was officially discontinued in 2020 and the endowment funds were returned to their respective universities.[97]/nJordan's papers are housed at Stanford University[98] and at Swarthmore College.[18]/nNumerous genera and species bear the name Jordan./nGenera:\nJordania Starks, 1895, Davidijordania Popov, 1931, and Jordanella Goode & Bean, 1879/nSpecies:", "13002203": "Christian Konrad Sprengel (22 September 1750 \u2013 7 April 1816) was a German naturalist, theologist, and teacher. He is most famous for his research on plant sexuality. Sprengel was the first to recognize that the function of flowers was to attract insects, and that nature favoured cross-pollination. Along with the work of Joseph Gottlieb K\u00f6lreuter he set the foundations for the modern study of floral biology and anthecology, but his work was not widely recognized until Charles Darwin examined and confirmed several of his observations almost 50 years later; see Fertilisation of Orchids (1862)./nSprengel was born in Brandenburg an der Havel in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. He was the 15th and the last son of a preacher Ernst Victor Sprengel and his second wife Dorothea Gnadenreich Schaeffer (died 1778). Ernst Victor's father had been an organist and he himself was a choir-master, teacher and later archdeacon. Christian Konrad was expected to continue the traditional profession and he studied theology in Halle. In 1774, in Berlin, he became a teacher and in 1780 moved to Spandau to head the Great Lutheran Town School. His interest in plants began around the age of 30 when he was advised by his surgeon to spend time outdoors for the health of his eyes. The surgeon was Ernst Ludwig Heim, an amateur mycologist and botanist who also influenced Alexander von Humboldt./nSprengel undertook the study of plants, collaborating with Carl Ludwig Willdenow on his work Florae Berolinensis Prodromus (1787). He then proceeded to specifically study the pollination of plants, especially the interaction between flowers and their insect visitors in what was later called pollination syndrome. From his considerable research Sprengel published his first work, Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (Berlin 1793), which established him as a founder of pollination ecology and floral biology as scientific disciplines. Together with Josef G. K\u00f6hlreuter, a predecessor, he is acknowledged as one of the two classic authors in this field. While conducting his researches on plants, Sprengel appears to have neglected management of the school, which mainly served the rich and powerful. Sprengel was accused of mistreating some of the students. He was accused of punishing a mayor's son by making him stand in class and hitting him with a stick leading to injury. A nine-year-old son of a councillor was beaten up as were several other children. Sprengel was ultimately dismissed from service in 1784.[1][2]/nSprengel subsequently lived on a pension and earnings from leading public outings on botanical field trips. He published a work on the usefulness of bees in 1811, suggesting that bee-hives be placed close to planted fields to enhance crop yield via bee pollination. Towards the end of his life he returned to studying classical literature and published his last book on Roman Poets with his comments in 1815. He died on 7 April 1816 and is buried at the Invalidenfriedhof in Berlin. His gravesite is unmarked and no portrait of him is known to exist.[1]/nDuring Sprengel's time scholars of natural science (naturalists), including botanist Joseph Gottlieb K\u00f6lreuter, viewed insects as only accidental or incidental visitors to flowers. They were seen as thieves of nectar which was considered a fluid meant to nourish the growing seed. (It was believed that the flower was the place for the marriage of the male and female parts and that self-fertilization was the norm.) Fertilization was understood by Kolreuter; he referred to pollen as farina fecundens (the \"fertilizing flour\"). Both Kolreuter and Sprengel believed in intelligent creation and sought and used teleological explanations of phenomena. (Like John Ray, Sprengel believed that observing nature was a kind of church service of beholding what \"the wise Creator of nature had produced\".)[1]/nSprengel began various botanical observations in 1787. He noticed that the wood cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum) had soft hairs on the lower part of the petals, and came to a hypothesis that they protected nectar from rain in a way similar to that which eyebrows and eyelashes prevented sweat from entering the eye. He collaborated with Willdenow in describing Silene chlorantha (Willd.) Ehrh. (Caryophyllaceae), which was extremely rare in Berlin district. It took six years before Sprengel published the work of his own researches. The book was based on the studies of 461 plants, presenting some 25 copperplate engravings based on his own drawings.[1]/nSprengel identified that flowers were essentially organs adapted in their structures to attract insects, which events aided in pollinating the plant. He observed that nectar was an attractant and that petals had markings that guided insects to the nectar. He also observed dichogamy, both protogyny and protandry, and pointed out that these phenomena helped prevent self-pollination. He also noticed self-incompatibility. He classified insects as generalists and specialists and identified the principle of buzz pollination in Leucojum. He noticed that some flowers were nectarless, especially those that were wind-pollinated. He also observed that some flowers such as orchids attracted insects but did not have nectar but he did not fully understand the nature of the deception. He also recognized nectar theft by certain insects.[1]/nDuring his lifetime, Spengel's work was somewhat neglected by his peers, who themselves did not recognize the immanent importance of his findings re the aspects of selection and evolution; but it was also in part rejected because many of his contemporaries viewed as obscene the idea that flowers had anything to do with sexual functions. A. W. Henschel in Breslau (1820), wrote that Sprengel's idea gave the impression of a fairy tale to entertain a schoolboy. Sprengel's own Dr Heim, see above, gave the work a very favourable review, writing: the \"work is a masterpiece, an original  of which all of Germany can be proud\". Georg Franz Hoffmann, the director of the botanical garden in G\u00f6ttingen, noted that he himself had verified some of Sprengel's observations. Years later, Robert Brown introduced Sprengel's book to Charles Darwin, who lauded Sprengel and noted: \"he clearly proved by innumerable observations how essential a part insects play in the fertilization of many plants. But he was in advance of his age.\" Darwin was impressed by Sprengel's approach; it inspired him in his own studies that led to the On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing (1862), where he concluded that nature abhors perpetual self-fertilization.[2]/nPlant pollination was studied further by Federico Delpino, who coined various terms for the modes and means by which it occurred.[3] Important modern successors like Paul Knuth, Fritz Knoll, and Hans Kugler were inspired by Sprengel and advanced the fields of pollination ecology and floral biology. After the second World War, their work was continued by Stefan Vogel, Knut Faegri, Leendert van der Pijl, Amots Dafni, and G. Ledyard Stebbins, as well as by Herbert Baker and Irene Baker.[1]/nJames Edward Smith named a genus of Epacridaceae in Sprengel's honour as Sprengelia. Kurt Sprengel, Christian Konrad's nephew who also wrote a history of medicine, was nominated to the \"Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft\".[1]", "3073517": "Sir Henry Harris FRS FAA (28 January 1925 \u2013 31 October 2014)[2][3] was an Australian professor of medicine at the University of Oxford who led pioneering work on cancer and human genetics in the 2000s./nHarris was born in 1925 to a Jewish family in the Soviet Union. In 1929, his family emigrated to Australia.[2] Harris studied at Sydney Boys High School from 1937 to 1941.[4] In 1941, he first read modern languages, but was subsequently attracted to medicine through his literary interests. He studied medicine at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and began a career in medical research rather than in clinical practice./nIn the early 1950s, Harris moved to England to study at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford under Howard Florey. He completed his DPhil in 1954 and settled down to a career of academic research. In 1960, he was appointed the head of the new department of cell biology at the John Innes Institute, and, in 1964, he succeeded Florey as head of the Dunn School. In 1979, he was appointed as Oxford's Regius Professor of Medicine, succeeding Richard Doll./nHarris's research interests were primarily focused on cancer cells and their differences from normal cells. He later studied the possibility of genetic modification of human cell lines with the material of other species to increase the range of genetic markers. Harris and his colleagues developed some of the basic techniques for investigating and measuring genes along the human chromosome./nIn 1965, he reported his observation that most nuclear RNA was non-coding, a view that was not widely accepted until years later.[5] In 1969, Harris showed that when malignant cancer cells were fused with normal fibroblasts, the resulting hybrids were not malignant, thus demonstrating the existence of genes that could suppress malignancy. Work on these tumour suppressor genes has become a worldwide industry.[citation needed]/nIn 1983, Harris was elected to the Australian Academy of Science as a Corresponding Fellow. In 1993, he was knighted.[2]/nMuch of Harris's work has been supported by Cancer Research UK (formerly the Cancer Research Campaign).[citation needed]/nHe died on 31 October 2014, aged 89.", "52225525": "Ran Nathan (born 1962) is an Israeli biologist, ornithologist, and academic./nHe is an ecologist who holds the Adelina and Massimo Della Pergola Chair of life Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem[2][3] in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior[4] where he leads the Movement Ecology Lab.[5] Additionally, Nathan is the director of the Minerva Center for Movement Ecology[1] and the co-founding co-Editor-in-Chief of the free-access journal Movement Ecology (BioMed Central).[6]/nHis work focuses on various aspects of movement ecology, including dispersal (and long-distance dispersal in particular), migration, foraging, navigation, flight aerodynamics, animal behavior, social interactions, invasive species, disease spread by avian species, gene flow, plant-animal interactions and plant recruitment.[3][5]/nNathan's earlier work (since 1999) focused on seed dispersal, and long-distance dispersal (LDD) in particular. In a series of studies he and his colleagues demonstrated the strength of the mechanistic approach in understanding seed dispersal[7] and plant dynamics,[8] as well as the importance of rare long-distance dispersal events in plants (Nathan 2006 Science), their underlying mechanisms [9] and their role in determining spread rates of plants in future environments.[10]/nIn an interview for Science Watch (October 2010),[11] Nathan revealed that the idea to establish Movement Ecology as a new field of research was born in 2002, when he was a first-year faculty member supervising one student on seed dispersal and another on bird migration, facing the question \u201cwhat name should I call my research group\u201d? This has led him to wonder why different movement phenomena are studied in isolation from each other, and why there is still no general unifying theory of  organismal movement. He then decided to call his research group \"movement ecology\", and later on noticed this term has already been used in the literature, but very occasionally at the time and never in the context of a unifying research paradigm./nIn 2006, Nathan initiated and led an international group at the Israel Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem[12] which has set the foundation for development of the field of Movement Ecology  as a new integration of movement research.

She learned natural history from her father and grandfather, and her mother and grandmother taught her horticulture. From an early age, she expressed a desire to teach. She graduated from Provincial Normal School. Her initial attempts to attend a university were hindered by the fact she was a woman. In 1905, she began a class in gardening at Cornell University. She was then able to obtain permission to pursue a degree in science. At Cornell, she studied botany and zoology; it is where she first took entomology.[3]/nAfter graduating with a Bachelor's of Science in 1908,[3][4] she obtained a fellowship in entomology at the University of Illinois.[4] She earned her Master of Science in 1913. She was denied a fellowship for a Doctor of Philosophy because she was a woman.[3] The Illinois Natural History Survey offered her work, which she excepted. In 1914, she was granted a fellowship that would allow her to turn her work with the Illinois Natural History Survey into a doctoral dissertation.[3] In 1915, she was awarded a doctorate,[4] and her thesis A Classification of the Lepidoptera based on characters of the pupae was published as a major bulletin of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History. Her doctoral advisor was Alexander D. MacGillivray\u00a0[Wikidata]. Mosher's thesis, considered pioneering at the time, remains a definitive work on Lepidoptera.[3][5][6]/nEdna Mosher taught school in Nova Scotia from 1902\u20131905 to earn enough to pay for her own education. After earning her Bachelor's degree, Mosher was a supervisor of nature study and school gardens until 1910. She taught for a time at Gary, Indiana. In 1913 she began work for the Illinois Natural History Survey. In 1915 she worked at the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station for a summer. Following that, she was an instructor at Illinois, Ohio State University,[4] and eventually the University of New Mexico. At the University of New Mexico, she became a Professor of Biology and later Dean of Women.[4][7] In 1923, after her mother fell ill, Mosher moved to Garden City, New York where she taught biology at Adelphi University until retirement in 1942.[3] She died May 7, 1972, in Windsor, Nova Scotia.[5][8]/nMosher was the first woman fellow of the Entomological Society of America, in 1920.[9]", "31024696": "David William Sims MAE (born 1969) is a British marine biologist known for using satellite tracking to study wild behaviour of sharks and for the Global Shark Movement Project.[1][2] He is Senior Research Fellow at the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association (MBA) in Plymouth, and a Professor of Marine Ecology in the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton at the University of Southampton, U.K./nHe works in the field of animal ecology researching movements, behaviour and conservation of sharks.

Between 1994 and 1995 Sims did postdoctoral research on physiology of fish behaviour with Paul L.R. Andrews and J. Z. Young FRS after which he was lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. Between 1998 and 2000 he was lecturer in the Zoology Department at the University of Aberdeen before becoming a Research Fellow at the Marine Biological Association Laboratory in Plymouth in 2000.[4]/nHe was made Senior Research Fellow at the Marine Biological Association in 2005, became a professor in 2008, and in 2012 was appointed jointly as professor at the University of Southampton./nSims is also a recipient[6] of an advanced grant from the European Research Council.[7]/nDavid Sims is known for research on the behaviour, ecology and conservation of sharks[8] studied using remote tracking technology (telemetry), for studying climate change impacts on fishes, and for making advances in the field of animal movement ecology.[9]/nBeginning in 1995 Sims studied the behavioural ecology of the plankton-feeding basking shark, the world's second largest fish.[10] He showed from long-term field studies of behaviour and satellite tracking that basking sharks feed on specific assemblages of zooplankton and do not hibernate in winter,[11][12][13] overturning an understanding which had stood for nearly 50 years.[14] Sims' satellite tracking of basking sharks were some of the first long-term trackings of any shark species[15] and contributed directly to successful conservation proposals to list basking sharks on Appendix II of the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (Feb 2003)[16][17] and the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) (Nov 2005)./nBasking sharks were also studied to find out how fish actually respond to variations in zooplankton prey density gradients in the ocean, showing basking sharks were useful as 'biological plankton recorders', results which were published in the journal Nature.[18] Results have demonstrated the biological significance of ocean fronts to predators,[19] which have potential as candidates for high-seas protected areas.[10]/nSince 2001, Sims has also made significant contributions[20] to understanding of climate change impacts on fish populations, including how climate-driven warming has altered migration timings,[21][22] dramatic community changes of European marine fish,[23][24] and vertical habitat compression of sharks due to ocean deoxygenation which can increase vulnerability to longline fishing.[25]/nResearch has identified common scaling laws that describe movement paths and behaviour patterns of marine predators.[26][27][28][29][30]/nIt is argued that Sims' work has provided the strongest empirical evidence[31][32][33] for the existence of movement patterns that are well approximated by biological L\u00e9vy flights and L\u00e9vy walks, a special class of random walk that theoretically optimise random searches for sparsely distributed resources.[34] It is said that Sims' work has shifted the debate on biological L\u00e9vy walks from whether they exist, to how and why they arise.[32][33] He also conducted the first empirical field tests of the L\u00e9vy flight foraging hypothesis./nIn the book Bursts: The Hidden Pattern Behind Everything We Do, the physicist and best-selling author Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si writes: \"Yet if a L\u00e9vy flight offers the best search strategy, why didn\u2019t natural selection force animals to exploit it? In February 2008 David Sims showed that it did, in fact.\"/nSims' 2008 Nature paper announcing the discovery of Scaling laws of marine predator search behaviour is a Web of Science Highly Cited Paper. Since then additional evidence for biological L\u00e9vy walks has accumulated across a wide range of taxa including microbes and humans[35] and in fossil trails of extinct invertebrates,[36] suggesting an ancient origin of the movement pattern. His work contributes to the emerging understanding[37] in animal movement ecology that normal diffusion is insufficient for describing natural movements such as searching behaviour but that anomalous diffusion is required./nHis studies published in Nature on L\u00e9vy and Brownian searches in ocean predators[26][27] inspired the optimal-foraging decision process used in an optimisation algorithm \u2013 the \"Marine Predators Algorithm\"[38] \u2013  a high-performance optimizer with applications to engineering and medicine, including electrical modeling of photovoltaic power plants,[39] renewable-energy systems design,[40] and COVID-19 x-ray image classification.[41]/nIn 2016 Sims led an international team tracking ocean-wide movements of sharks. They found pelagic sharks like the shortfin mako aggregate in space-use \"hotspots\" characterized by fronts and high plankton biomass.[42] Data showed longline fishing vessels also targeted the habitats and efficiently tracked shark movements seasonally, leading to an 80% spatial overlap. The work suggests current hotspots are at risk from overfishing and argued for introduction of international catch limits. The results were reported widely in the media including in The Times newspaper[43] and the journal Science.[44]/nHe initiated the Global Shark Movement Project, an international collaboration of research groups across 26 countries. The database assembled contains over 2,000 satellite tracks of sharks and is used \"to find out where sharks aggregate, how distributions are influenced by environmental variations, and the global overlap with anthropogenic threats such as fisheries\"./nIn 2019 the team published its first results in Nature reporting a global spatial risk assessment of sharks.[45] They showed nearly one quarter of shark space-use hotspots overlap with longline fisheries each month, rising to over 60% each month for commercially valuable sharks (like shortfin mako) and internationally protected species (like great white shark). Shark hotspots were also associated with significant increases in fishing effort, leading the team to conclude that pelagic sharks have limited spatial refuge from current levels of fishing effort in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas). They suggest large-scale marine reserves centred on shark hotspots could help to limit shark exploitation on the high seas. The paper was reported worldwide including by the BBC,[46] CNN[47] and NPR.[48]/nIt has been commented[49] that the paper has \"provided a much-needed blueprint for conservation actions that could be used to provide sharks with safe havens in our increasingly crowded oceans\"./nSims' research on basking shark behaviour was the subject of an award-winning documentary, \"Email from a shark\", by the Cornish film company Shark Bay Films, that aired on Sky in December 2004.

He graduated with a degree in natural sciences from Christ's College, Cambridge, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. He then completed a Masters degree at the University of Western Ontario, with a thesis on the regulation of development in a mudsnail.[1] His PhD on Satellite DNA was conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit in Edinburgh./nAfter achieving his doctorate, Clark joined John Bishop's team at the Institute of Genetics, University of Edinburgh, where he carried out research into the genes in the liver of mice. In 1985 he was appointed to the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (subsequently the Roslin Institute) where he began work in genetic modification to produce a sheep giving milk with human proteins. He was successful within five years. Tracy, born in 1990, was the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein, making 35g of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (used in treatment of cystic fibrosis) in each litre of her milk. During the 1990s, Clark continued to develop transgenic techniques on large animals. With his colleagues, he produced a sheep from which a prion protein gene had been removed, the first time this had been achieved in a large animal. Clark's work set the stage for Ian Wilmut's team at Roslin to clone a sheep, Dolly (1996), the result of transplanted DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilized egg cell.

He was the oldest of three sons of Quakers George Hodgkin and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. His father was the son of Thomas Hodgkin and had read for the Natural Science Tripos at Cambridge where he had befriended electrophysiologist Keith Lucas.[2]/nBecause of poor eyesight he was unable to study medicine and eventually ended up working for a bank in Banbury. As members of the Society of Friends, George and Mary opposed the Military Service Act of 1916, which introduced conscription, and had to endure a great deal of abuse from their local community, including an attempt to throw George in one of the town canals.[3] In 1916, George Hodgkin travelled to Armenia as part of an investigation of distress. Moved by the misery and suffering of Armenian refugees he attempted to go back there in 1918 on a route through the Persian Gulf (as the northern route was closed because of the October Revolution in Russia). He died of dysentery in Baghdad on 24 June 1918, just a few weeks after his youngest son, Keith, had been born.[4]/nFrom an early life on, Hodgkin and his brothers were encouraged to explore the country around their home, which instilled in Alan an interest in natural history, particularly ornithology. At the age of 15, he helped Wilfred Backhouse Alexander with surveys of heronries and later, at Gresham's School, he overlapped and spent a lot of time with David Lack.[5][6] In 1930, he was the winner of a bronze medal in the Public Schools Essay Competition organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.[7]/nAlan started his education at The Downs School where his contemporaries included future scientists Frederick Sanger, Alec Bangham, \"neither outstandingly brilliant at school\" according to Hodgkin,[8] as well as future artists Lawrence Gowing and Kenneth Rowntree. After the Downs School, he went on to Gresham's School where he overlapped with future composer Benjamin Britten as well as Maury Meiklejohn.[9] He ended up receiving a scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge in botany, zoology and chemistry.[10]/nBetween school and college, he spent May 1932 at the Freshwater Biological Station at Wray Castle based on a recommendation of his future Director of Studies at Trinity, Carl Pantin.[11] After Wray Castle, he spent two months with a German family in Frankfurt as \"in those days it was thought highly desirable that anyone intending to read science should have a reasonable knowledge of German.\"[12] After his return to England in early August 1932, his mother Mary was remarried to Lionel Smith (1880\u20131972),[13] the eldest son of A. L. Smith, whose daughter Dorothy was also married to Alan's uncle Robert Howard Hodgkin.[14]/nIn the autumn of 1932, Hodgkin started as a freshman scholar at Trinity College where his friends included classicists John Raven and Michael Grant, fellow-scientists Richard Synge and John H. Humphrey,[15] as well as Polly and David Hill, the children of Nobel laureate Archibald Hill.[5][16] He took physiology with chemistry and zoology for the first two years, including lectures by Nobel laureate E.D. Adrian.[17] For Part II of the tripos he decided to focus on physiology instead of zoology. Nevertheless, he participated in a zoological expedition to the Atlas Mountains in Morocco led by John Pringle in 1934.[18] He finished Part II of the tripos in July 1935 and stayed at Trinity as a research fellow.[19]/nDuring his studies, Hodgkin, who described himself as \"having been brought up as a supporter of the British Labour Party\"[20] was friends with communists[21] and actively participated in the distribution of anti-war pamphlets.[22] At Cambridge, he knew James Klugmann[23] and John Cornford,[24] but he emphasised in his autobiography that none of his friends \"made any serious effort to convert me [to Communism], either then or later.\"[25] From 1935 to 1937, Hodgkin was a member of the Cambridge Apostles.[26]/nHodgkin started conducting experiments on how electrical activity is transmitted in the sciatic nerve of frogs in July 1934.[27] He found that a nerve impulse arriving at a cold or compression block, can decrease the electrical threshold beyond the block, suggesting that the impulse produces a spread of an electrotonic potential in the nerve beyond the block.[28]\nIn 1936, Hodgkin was invited by Herbert Gasser, then director of the Rockefeller Institute in New York City, to work in his laboratory during 1937\u201338. There he met Rafael Lorente de N\u00f3[29] and Kenneth Stewart Cole with whom he ended up publishing a paper.[30] During that year he also spent time at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory where he was introduced to the squid giant axon,[31] which ended up being the model system with which he conducted most of the research that eventually led to his Nobel Prize. \nIn the spring of 1938, he visited Joseph Erlanger at Washington University in St. Louis who told him he would take Hodgkin's local circuit theory of nerve impulse propagation seriously if he could show that altering the resistance of the fluid outside a nerve fibre made a difference to the velocity of nerve impulse conduction.[32] Working with single nerve fibres from shore crabs and squids, he showed that the conduction rate was much faster in seawater than in oil, providing strong evidence for the local circuit theory.[33]/nAfter his return to Cambridge he started collaborating with Andrew Huxley who had entered Trinity as a freshman in 1935, three years after Hodgkin.[34] With a \u00a3300 equipment grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, Hodgkin managed to set up a similar physiology setup to the one he had worked with at the Rockefeller Institute. He moved all his equipment to the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in July 1939.[35] There, he and Huxley managed to insert a fine cannula into the giant axon of squids and record action potentials from inside the nerve fibre. They sent a short note of their success to  Nature just before the outbreak of World War II.[36]/nDespite his Quaker upbringing, Hodgkin was eager to join the war effort as contact with the Nazis during his stay in Germany in 1932 had removed all his pacifist beliefs. His first post was at the Royal Aircraft Establishment where he worked on issues in aviation medicine, such as oxygen supply for pilots at high altitudes and the decompression sickness caused by nitrogen bubbles coming out of the blood.[37] In February 1940 he transferred to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) where he worked on the development of centimetric radar, including the design of the village Inn AGLT airborne gun-laying system. He was a member of E.G. Bowen's group in St Athan in South Wales and lived in a local guest house together with John Pringle and Robert Hanbury Brown. The group moved to Swanage\u00a0in May 1940 where Pringle replaced Bowen as leader of the group.[38] In March 1941, Hodgkin flew on the test flight of a Bristol Blenheim fitted with the first airborne centimetric radar system. In February and March 1944, he visited the MIT Radiation Laboratory to help foster the interchange of information on developments in radar between Britain and America.[39]/nProviding a readable account of the little-known piece of military history that he was a part of during World War II was a main motivation for Hodgkin to write his autobiography Chance and Design: Reminiscences of Science in Peace and War.[40]/nAs the Allied Forces' invasion of France and their continued advance towards Germany in autumn 1944 suggested an end of the war in the foreseeable future, Hodgkin started to plan his return to a career in research at Cambridge. He renewed his collaboration with W. A. H. Rushton and they published an article on how to calculate a nerve fibre's membrane resistance, membrane capacity, its axoplasm's resistance, and the resistance of the external fluid in which the fibre is placed, from experimental observations.[41]/nAfter being released from military service in August 1945 upon Adrian's request, Hodgkin was able to restart his experiments in collaboration with Bernard Katz and his pre-war collaborator Andrew Huxley. They spent the summers of 1947, 1948, and 1949 at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory where they continued to measure resting and action potentials from inside the giant axon of the squid.[42] Together with Katz, he provided evidence that the permeability of the neuronal cell membrane for sodium increased during an action potential, thus allowing sodium ions to diffuse inward.[43] \nThe data they had obtained in 1949 resulted in a series of five papers published in The Journal of Physiology that described what became later known as the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model of the action potential and eventually earned Hodgkin and Huxley the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[44][45][46][47][48] Building on work by Kenneth S. Cole[49] they used a technique of electrophysiology, known as the voltage clamp to measure ionic currents through the membranes of squid axons while holding the membrane voltage at a set level. They proposed that the characteristic shape of the action potential is caused by changes in the selective permeability of the membrane for different ions, specifically sodium, potassium, and chloride. A model that relies on a set of differential equations and describes each component of an excitable cell as an electrical element was in good agreement with their empirical measurements.[48][50]/nThe cell membrane depolarisation sequence where a small depolarization leads to an increase in sodium permeability, which leads to influx of sodium ions, which in turn depolarizes the membrane even more[51] is now known as the Hodgkin cycle.[52]/nIn addition, Hodgkin and Huxley's findings led them to hypothesize the existence of ion channels on cell membranes, which were confirmed only decades later. Confirmation of ion channels came with the development of the patch clamp leading to a Nobel prize in 1991 for Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, and in 2003 for Roderick MacKinnon.[53]/nAfter establishing ion movements across a selectively permeable cell membrane as the mechanism of the action potential, Hodgkin turned his attention to how the ionic interchange that occurs during the action potential could be reversed afterwards. Together with Richard Keynes he demonstrated that in addition to the changes in permeability that lead to an action potential, there is a secretory mechanism that ejects sodium and absorbs potassium against the electrochemical gradients.[54] A few years later, the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou discovered the enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase that uses ATP to export three sodium ions in exchange for two potassium ions that are imported,[55] for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1997.[56]\nHodgkin was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953 by Lord Adrian.[57] In October 1961, he was told by Swedish journalists that he, Huxley, and Eccles had been awarded the Nobel Prize. This turned out to be a false alarm, however, when shortly thereafter it was announced that the 1961 Prize was awarded to Georg von B\u00e9k\u00e9sy. It was only two years later that Hodgkin, Huxley, and Eccles were finally awarded the Prize \"for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane\".[58][59] During the Nobel Banquet on 10 December 1963, Hodgkin gave the traditional speech on behalf of the three neurophysiologists, thanking the king and the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine for the award.[60] Incidentally, Hodgkin and his wife attended the Nobel Prize ceremony a second time, three years later, when Hodgkin's father-in-law, Francis Peyton Rous, was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[61]/nFrom 1951 to 1969, Hodgkin was the Foulerton Professor of the Royal Society at Cambridge. In 1970 he became the John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge. Around this time he also ended his experiments on nerve at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and switched his focus to visual research which he could do in Cambridge with the help of others while serving as president of the Royal Society. Together with Denis Baylor and Peter Detwiler he published a series of papers on turtle photoreceptors.[62][63][64][65][66][67][68]/nFrom 1970 to 1975 Hodgkin served as the 53rd president of the Royal Society (PRS).

She is also known for her work on microtubule severing enzymes spastin and Katanin.[2][1]/nAntonina Roll-Mecak was born in Romania. Her father was an engineer and scientist. Growing up, her father would tutor her in Newtonian physics, creating complex pulley-related problems for her to solve, and would teach her the principles of programming through Fortran punch cards.[3] During summers, she attended camps focused on math and science, and trained for academic Olympiads. She also spent summer breaks training for and competing in piano competitions, and as a child she aspired to be a concert pianist. However, due to the travel restrictions existing in Romania at the time, she ultimately chose to pursue a scientific path.[4]/nShe attended high school at the Gheorghe Laz\u0103r National College in Sibiu, in the Transylvania region. The school specializes in science education, and acceptance into the school was dependent on success in preliminary entrance exams.[5]/nRoll-Mecak received her bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Cooper Union in New York City, which operates on a full-tuition scholarship basis. During her studies, she completed a summer internship at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where she worked with Ernie Mehler and Harel Weinstein.[4] Part of her inspiration to pursue structural biology came from a seminar on protein structure she attended at the New York Academy of Sciences as a student.[6] She received her Bachelor of Engineering summa cum laude in 1996./nShe received her PhD in molecular biophysics in 2002 from the Rockefeller University.[6] There, she studied with Stephen Burley, and worked with others scientists such as G\u00fcnter Blobel and Rod MacKinnon.

His pioneering life-history studies of the living bird helped in changing the nature of ornithology from what was then a collection-oriented field. He was a longtime director of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at the University of Oxford./nLack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack MD FRCS, who later became President of the British Medical Association.[6] The name 'Lack' is derived from 'Lock'. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the London Hospital. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David's interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the Indian army. Kathleen's father was Scottish and on her mother's side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian.[1] Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women's suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent's Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster's School, Stubbington and Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk. Lack was taught biology at Gresham's by W.H. Foy and G.H. Lockett.[7] He went to Magdalene College, Cambridge and received a BA second class in 1933 after studying botany, zoology and geology for part I of the Tripos and zoology for part II.[8][9]/nUntil the age of fifteen, Lack lived in a large house in Devonshire Place, London. The family spent their summers in New Romney Kent where Lack became familiar with the local birds especially on Romney Marsh.[10] By the age of nine, he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list.[1] In 1926, Lack won the Holland-Martin Natural History Prize for an essay on \"Three Birds of Kelling Heath\".[11] In 1928, with an essay on 'My favourite birds' he was the national winner of the senior prize (a silver medal) in the Public School Essay Competition, organised by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.[12] David did not wish to follow his father's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology. His father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for David at the Frankfurt museum in the summer of 1929. He spent four months pinning insects in the Senckenberg Museum and found it \u201cextremely\u201d boring.[13] He joined the Cambridge Ornithological Club whose members included Peter Scott, Arthur Duncan, Dominic Serventy, and Tom Harrisson. His first scientific paper was on the display of nightjars, published in the Ibis in 1932. He joined on several expeditions with Cambridge researchers including two to the Arctic.[14] Lack wrote The Birds of Cambridgeshire (1934) which was published by the Cambridge Bird Club. In this work, he departed from the contemporary style with a distinct de-emphasis on rare and accidental birds.[15]/nLack received an Sc.D. from Cambridge University in 1948.[16]/nAfter Cambridge, Lack, on the recommendation of Julian Huxley took up a position as a science mentor at Dartington Hall School,[17] Devonshire from 1934 until Summer 1938 when he took a year off to study bird behaviour on the Galapagos Islands. In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met Joseph Grinnell and Robert McCabe and gave a talk at the Cooper Ornithological Club. In New York, he met Ernst Mayr at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the SS Bremen, only one of about four English speakers on the German ship.[18] He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the California Academy of Sciences which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by Harry Swarth and at Ernst Mayr's home in New Jersey. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen.[19]  He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war.[20] Lack published The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift.[21] Lack's first major work was The Life of the Robin, which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at Dartington Hall School. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds.[22] The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack's students at Dartington Hall was Eva Ibbotson. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from R.E. Moreau.[23]/nLack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, Leonard Knight Elmhirst. During World War II Lack however served with a British Army unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on radar use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including George Varley, an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations.[24] Lack's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of radar ornithology to study bird migration.[25][26] Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding W.B. Alexander) of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology at Oxford University, a position that he held until his death in 1973./nLack's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the living bird. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution.[27] Lack's major scientific research included work on population biology and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured clutch sizes that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by V.C. Wynne-Edwards who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on group selection. Lack's studies were based on nidicolous birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.[28]/nAs a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the \"simplest explanation, which was probably best.\" He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.[29]/nHe wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title \"Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop\". This 1935 publication was subsequently titled \"Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, Euplectes hordeacea hordeacea (Linn.)\" in the journal Ibis as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.[30]/nLack's most famous work is Darwin's Finches, a landmark study whose title linked Darwin's name with the Galapagos group of species and popularised the term \"Darwin's finches\" in 1947, though the term had been introduced by Percy Lowe in 1936.[31] There are two versions of this work, differing significantly in their conclusions. The first is a book-length monograph, written after his visit to the Galapagos, but not published until 1945.[32] In it Lack interprets the differences in bill size as species recognition signals, that is, as isolating mechanisms./nThe second is the later book in which the differences in bill size are interpreted as adaptations to specific food niches, an interpretation that has since been abundantly confirmed.[3] This change of mind, according to Lack's Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis, in which natural selection came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues.[33] Lack's work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the Galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas.[34] According to Ernst Mayr,/nIn 1943 Lack took an interest in clutch size after reading Moreau's manuscript sent to the Ibis. Lack was then an assistant to the editor of the Ibis.[36] Lack postulated what is now known as Lack's Principle, which states that \"the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food\".[37][38]\n[39]/nLack took a keen interest in the mechanisms involved in regulating populations in nature. The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers is one of Lack's most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by J.B.S. Haldane who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was V.C. Wynne-Edwards with whom he clashed for nearly a decade.[40] Lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including Population Studies of Birds (1966)./nThe centenary of Lack's birth, 16 July 2010, was marked by a 'David Lack Centenary Symposium', hosted by the Edward Grey Institute.  A programme of talks focused on and celebrated the scientific contributions of Lack to ornithology, and the broader fields of ecology and evolution, and assessed the development of these fields in the 21st century.[42]/nDavid Lack married Elizabeth Lack (n\u00e9e Silva) who was also an ornithologist. Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to join the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to Richard Fitter who passed it on to David Lack with a note \"Here's another for your reject file.\" Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley.[43] They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), Andrew Lack (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain).[4] In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in Park Town, Oxford, and later on Boars Hill, just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated.[44] Lack died from Non-Hodgkin lymphoma despite radiation treatments.[45]/nLack's parents belonged to the Church of England, and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to Anglicanism in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall.[46] He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, Evolutionary theory and Christian belief, on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility.[47] This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between religion and science later popularised by Stephen Jay Gould./nArthur Cain remarked of him, \"David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection.\"[48]", "747090": "Pierre Paul \u00c9mile Roux FRS[1] (17 December 1853\u00a0\u2013 3 November 1933)[2] was a French physician, bacteriologist and immunologist. Roux was one of the closest collaborators of Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895), a co-founder of the Pasteur Institute, and responsible for the institute's production of the anti-diphtheria serum, the first effective therapy for this disease. Additionally, he investigated cholera, chicken-cholera, rabies, and tuberculosis. Roux is regarded as a founder of the field of immunology.[3]/nRoux was born in Confolens, Charente. It is believed that Roux had a fatherless childhood.[4] He received his baccalaureate in sciences in 1871 and started his studies in 1872 at the Medical School of Clermont-Ferrand. He worked initially as a student assistant in chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences, under \u00c9mile Duclaux. From 1874 to 1878, he continued his studies in Paris and was admitted as clinical assistant at H\u00f4tel-Dieu. Between 1874 and 1877, Roux received a fellowship for the Military School at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, but quit it after failing to present his dissertation in due time. It is also believed that Roux may have been dismissed from the military for some form of insubordination.[4] In 1878, he started to work as an assistant to the course on fermentation given by his patron Duclaux at the Sorbonne University.[1]/nIn 1878, Pierre Paul Emile Roux married Rose Anna Shedlock, but it was kept a secret. Shedlock met Roux at the Paris medical school. Shedlock then died in 1879 of tuberculosis. In an inaccurate biography, Roux's niece stated that Shedlock contracted tuberculosis from Roux. However, this is unlikely, given that Shedlock had symptoms before marrying Roux.[5] According to his niece, Roux allegedly believed that marriage was an opportunity for women to satisfy their \"deepest aspirations,\" while for men it was \"mutilation\".[4]/nDuclaux recommended Roux to Louis Pasteur, who was looking for assistants, and Roux joined Pasteur's laboratory as a research assistant from 1878 to 1883 at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris. When Roux first began his career with Pasteur, he started as an animal inoculator. He performed well in the technical tasks, and became more involved with research.[4] Roux began his research on the microbiological causation of diseases, and in this capacity worked with Pasteur on avian cholera (1879\u20131880) and anthrax (1879\u20131890), and was involved in the famous experiment on anthrax vaccination of animals at Pouilly-le-Fort\u00a0[fr].[1] In this vaccination experiment, Pasteur and Roux injected 25 sheep with their anthrax vaccine, and the other 25 were unvaccinated. All 50 sheep were injected with the anthrax bacillus. All 25 vaccinated sheep survived, and all 25 unvaccinated sheep died, just as Pasteur and Roux predicted.[4]/nLouis Pasteur and \u00c9mile Roux were sometimes in disagreement in their approach to disease. Pasteur was an experimental scientist, whereas Roux was more focused on clinical medicine. They also held different religious and political beliefs, with Pasteur being a right- leaning Catholic, and Roux being a left-leaning atheist. Given their many differences, they clashed often as they worked towards vaccines against anthrax and rabies. The main issues between Roux and Pasteur regarded the ethics of human experimentation, specifically, the amount evidence from animal experimentation on the rabies vaccine needed in order to justify giving the vaccine to humans. Roux was more reluctant to give the vaccine to humans without further evidence that it was safe in animals.[4]/nIn 1883, he presented a doctoral dissertation in medicine titled Des Nouvelles Acquisitions sur la Rage, in which he described his research on rabies with Pasteur since 1881, which led to the development of the first vaccination against this fearsome disease. Roux discovered the idea of intracranial transmission of rabies, which paved the road for many more Pastorian milestones in research.[4] Roux was now recognized as an expert in the nascent sciences of medical microbiology and immunology. With Pasteur's other assistants (Edmond Nocard, Louis Thuillier, who died while in Alexandria after contracting the disease, and Straus), Roux traveled in 1883 to Egypt to study a human cholera outbreak there, but they were unable to find the pathogen for the disease, which was later discovered in Alexandria by the German physician Robert Koch (1843\u20131910).[1]/nIn 1883 and for the following 40 years, \u00c9mile Roux became closely involved with the creation of what was to become the Pasteur Institute. Roux is known for developing the concept of combining development, research, and application in a specialized hospital. The most distinctive feature of the Pasteur Hospital was free access to medical care. The hospital was also known for being very hygienic for the time period.[6] He divided his time between biomedical research and administrative duties. In 1888, an important year in his career, he accepted the position of Director of Services, joined the editorial board of the Annales de l\u2019Institut Pasteur, and established the first regular course on microbiological technique, which would become extremely influential in the training of many important French and foreign researchers and physicians in infectious diseases.[7][1]/nThe development of a diphtheria anti-toxin serum was a race between researchers Emil Behring in Berlin, and \u00c9mile Roux in Paris. They both developed it nearly simultaneously. However, the serum was marketed differently in each country. In Germany, the serum was marketed in a private business setting, whereas in France, the serum was distributed through a communal health care system.[8] The race to develop the diphtheria anti-toxin serum was considered a national rivalry, although each team of researchers adopted each other's experimental practices and built off of each other.[9] In a controversy, the first Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine was given to Emil Von Behring for his work on the serum therapy for diphtheria. Roux had been nominated in 1888 for the isolation of the diphtheria toxin, but didn't win the prize in 1901 because his discovery was deemed to be too \"old.\" Over the years, Roux came close to the Nobel Prize but never won.[10]/nAlso in 1883, Roux published, with Alexandre Yersin, the first of his classical works on the causation of diphtheria by the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, then an extremely prevalent and lethal disease, particularly among children. Diphtheria is contagious microbial disease marked by throat lesions, polyneuritis, myocarditis, low blood pressure, and collapse.

Weiss is an American microbiologist who is a Professor of Microbiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

As of March 2020, Weiss serves as Co-Director of the University of Pennsylvania/Penn Medicine Center for Research on Coronavirus and Other Emerging Pathogens.[2]/nWeiss attended Roosevelt High School. She eventually studied biology at Brandeis University and graduated in 1971 with her B.A. She moved to Harvard University for her doctoral research, where she studied Virulent Newcastle disease.[3] Weiss started studying coronaviruses during her postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Francisco.[4] At the time, very little was known about the impact of coronaviruses, other than that they can cause the common cold in humans.[5]/nWeiss' coronavirus research has encompassed the emerging pathogens severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Human coronavirus OC43, Human coronavirus 229E and the coronavirus disease.[6][7] These coronaviruses have all evolved to shut down immune responses but have different accessory proteins.[8] Coronaviruses are complex viruses that circulate in animals and occasionally infect humans.[9] They have the largest RNA genome of any viruses, which indicates that they have a wide array of proteins that can attack host cells.[9] Whilst MERS has a viral reservoir in camels and may be transmitted to humans via camel handlers, SARS does not have such a specific reservoir.[5] Coronaviruses that occur in humans are primarily viruses of the respiratory tract.[10]/nWeiss began to work on coronaviruses in the 1980s, when the field was relatively new. She makes use of the murine coronavirus (known as mouse hepatitis virus or MHV) to develop mouse models that allow the study of various pathologies, including viral encephalitis and demyelinating disease.[11][10][12] She uses a reverse genetic system to better manipulate the viral genome. Reverse genetics helps to understand the function of a gene through the analysis of phenotypic effects of nucleic acid sequences. She looks to understand what determines coronavirus viral and cellular tropism, as well as better understanding the pathogenesis of coronavirus in the brain.[10] This has involved studies of the interferon antagonists that are encoded by the coronavirus, specifically phosphodiesterase, which antagonizes OAS-RNase L (Ribonuclease L) immune pathway.[10] Weiss has considered the mechanisms by which the phosphodiesterase antagonizes Ribonuclease L. She has studied the role of inflammasome-related cytokines in mouse hepatitis virus-induced disease.[10] Despite murine coronavirus being a useful model of coronaviruses, it is still unclear how mouse hepatitis virus is spread.[10] There is only one receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus \u2013 the carcinoembryonic antigen \u2013 but highly virulent strains of the virus can spread even when this receptor is not present.[10]/nIn 2020, Weiss was made Co-Director of the University of Pennsylvania Center of Research for Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens.[5][13] The Center looks to accelerate research that focuses on SARS-CoV-2, become a centralized repository of SARS-CoV-2 research and create new opportunities to fund research relating to SARS-CoV-2.[14][15] SARS-CoV-2 is different to SARS; as there are many people who have mild or asymptomatic coronavirus disease without being aware that they have it.[16][17] Whereas in the case of SARS, patients were too unwell to leave their homes, so they tended to self-isolate, and the virus was most transmissible from severely ill patients rather than asymptomatic ones.[18][5] In March 2020, Weiss was awarded certification from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to work with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a BSL 3 laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania.[6] As well as investigating potential antivirals, the Weiss laboratory are studying the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.[6] Work during the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic includes identification of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats,[19] the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,[20] and critical reviews of scientific evidence for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.[21]/nWeiss' work and expertise has been featured in the science podcast This Week in Virology in both 2020[22] and 2021.[23]", "55633535": "Duncan John Maskell, FMedSci (born 30 May 1961) is a British and Australian biochemist, academic, and academic administrator, who specialises in molecular microbiology and bacterial infectious diseases.

He died in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 12, 2017, aged 88.[2]/nZahavi is best known for his work on the handicap principle, which explains the evolution of characteristics, behaviors or structures that appear contrary to the principles of Darwinian evolution in that they appear to reduce fitness and endanger individual organisms.[3] Evolved by sexual selection, these act as signals of the status of the organism, functioning to e. g. attract mates. He expanded it with theories on honest signalling and the idea that selection would favour signals that impose a higher cost, those that are not easily cheated on. He worked in particular on the Arabian babbler, a long-lived and social bird with altruistic behaviour among unrelated individuals, not explainable by kin selection. Zahavi reinterpreted these behaviours according to his signal theory and its correlative, the handicap principle. The altruistic act is costly to the donor, but may improve attractiveness to potential mates, a form of competitive altruism.[4][5][6]/nZahavi is credited with co-developing the information centre hypothesis in 1973 with Peter Ward.[7] The information centre hypothesis states that birds live in communal roosts primarily to gain information on food resource locations from other roost individuals.[7]/nTowards the end of his life he attempted to apply his theory at the molecular scale and sought to examine for example whether the neurotransmitter acetylcholine was selected due to its toxicity.[8]/nIn 1980, The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Zahavi and two other colleagues, were awarded the Israel Prize for SPNI's special contribution to society and the State, for the environment.[9]/nIn 2011, Zahavi received the Fyssen Foundation's International Prize for the evolution of social communication.[10]/nIn 2016, Zahavi received a prize for lifetime achievement from the Israel Society of Ecology and Environmental Sciences.[11]", "52979336": "Oded B\u00e9j\u00e0 is a professor in the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, in the field of marine microbiology and metagenomics.[1]/nOded B\u00e9j\u00e0 is best known for discovering the first bacterial rhodopsin[2] naming it proteorhodopsin,[3] during his postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Edward DeLong.

Immediately after receiving her Ph.D., Weis joined the faculty of Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey, in 1967, where she was promoted to Professor in 1976.[3] In addition to teaching, she has conducted research on the threats faced by organisms in shallow coastal estuary environments, such as contamination from pollution, especially heavy metals, and invasive species.[2][4] Much of her research has been with marine life in the New York\u2013New Jersey Harbor area and the New Jersey Meadowlands, but she has also done research in Indonesia and Madagascar.[3][5] In the 1970s, Weis and her children starred in a Tang orange drink commercial because General Foods was promoting the product with ads featuring female scientists with cute kids.[6][7] During a sabbatical in 1983\u20131984, she received a Congressional Science Fellowship from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) where she worked for the Environment and Public Works Committee of the US Senate.[6] By publishing studies about how products such as pressure-treated wood used in bulkheads and pilings leach toxic metals into waterways, Weis has been able to influence laws and regulations that have led to manufacturers removing toxic metals from the products. Among the legislation that she has worked on were amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.[6]/nWeis later served on advisory committees for the US EPA, National Sea Grant College Program of NOAA, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, where she chairs the Science Advisory Board.[6][8] She co-chairs the Science and Technical Advisory Committee for the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary.[3] She also serves on the Waterfront Management Advisory Board of New York City and the National Marine Team of the Sierra Club and Plastic Free Waters Partnership.[2][6] Weis has served as president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences and volunteered with the Ecological Society of America, among other scientific bodies, and worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and other United Nations (UN) reports.

He is also an academic, and the couple have two children, Jennifer and Eric, and three grandchildren.[2] Weis enjoys choral singing and performing in musical theatre and comic opera, including at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.[3]/nIn the 1970s, Weis studied mummichogs' response to methylmercury. When exposed to methylmercury, some females produced eggs that were severely deformed, while other females produced eggs that were normal or only mildly affected. In contrast, mummichogs from a polluted estuary, Piles Creek, in Linden, New Jersey, produced embryos that were practically all normal after being exposed to the same amount of methylmercury, showing that they were tolerant to the chemical.[14] This research was the first finding of pollution tolerance in estuarine fish.[15] Tolerance to mercury was also seen in adult grass shrimp and fiddler crabs in the creek.[16] In the 1980s, Weis and her team found that, like the embryos, some sperm and eggs were also tolerant to mercury.[17] Juvenile and adult mummichogs, however, were not mercury-tolerant, and furthermore they did not grow as big or live as long as fish from clean environments. They matures faster and produced (tolerant) embryos sooner.[14] This research led to further studies showing that while various species in estuaries had adapted genetically to the pollutants, many individuals nevertheless developed liver problems and cancer. This in turn has led to efforts to clean up rivers and wetlands.[15]/nLater in the 1980s and 1990s, Weis and her team observed that adult mummichogs in the polluted estuary were slow to capture prey (grass shrimp) and were easier to catch by a predator (blue crabs). Most of their diet was detritus in the mud, which is not highly nutritious for them. Weis theorized that poor nutrition may have been partly responsible for their slow growth and reduced life span, and poor predator avoidance may have also been partly responsible for their reduced life span. The shrimp in Piles Creek were larger and more numerous than at clean sites, because their main predator, the mummichogs, were impaired.[18] Other species from polluted estuaries (fiddler crabs, juvenile bluefish and blue crabs) also had altered behavior.[19] Weis's later research in the New Jersey Meadowlands has shown, for example, that levels of mercury and other contaminants in sediment along the Hackensack River are so high that blue crabs, like the mummichogs, are slow at capturing live food (even though they are particularly aggressive), and eat a great deal of detritus, which is abnormal for a carnivorous crab.[19][20] Juvenile bluefish (\"snappers\") there exhibit slower swimming speed and reduced prey capture, and grow more slowly than their counterparts in a clean environment. Fish captured in the Hackensack frequently have empty stomachs, which is highly unusual for this voracious species.[19][5] Weis and her field research team documented, over the decades, the unhealthy effects of pollutants on the coastal species in Piles Creek and the Meadowlands, as compared with similar animals in the cleaner waters of Tuckerton, New Jersey. She concluded that, while the Clean Water Act has helped improve the quality of the environment in industrial areas in northern New Jersey, stronger regulation is needed.[8]/nWeis's habitat studies over the decades have included marine animal associations with mangroves[21] and with salt marsh plants, comparing the native Spartina with the invasive reed Phragmites,[22] showing that the invasive plant sequesters more metal pollutants than the native plant, without releasing them back into the environment.[23] This invasive species (which is being removed in restoration projects) performs some services for the environment and should be managed more sensitively.[24]/nWeis led a study of the status of New Jersey coastal marshes with respect to sea level rise. It found that most coastal marshes, which protect local communities from flooding and storm surge, are not elevating[25] as rapidly as the sea level is rising and are also losing acreage. The study, published in 2021, discussed four possible remedies: allowing marshes to migrate inland through pathways created by removing developments and structures, changing the management (removal) of the reed Phragmites, adding sediments on top of marshes to increase elevation, and building \"living shorelines\" that incorporate harder materials, like oyster reefs, at the marsh edge to reduce erosion.[26][27]/nIn addition to the papers cited in this entry, the following are selected articles by Weis:", "39773833": "Douglas H.

Sabin.[1]/nChumakov graduated in 1931 from Moscow State University Medical School that was later transformed into I.M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy. In 1937 Chumakov participated in a scientific expedition to Khabarovsk region of Soviet Far East that was led by Professor Lev A. Zilber. Together with his colleagues he discovered the etiology of a new transmissible neurological disease called tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and isolated the virus that causes it. He was accidentally infected with the virus and developed encephalitis that led to a permanent loss of hearing and paralysis of the right arm. For this discovery he was awarded Stalin Prize of First Degree in Science and Technology in 1941. In 1948 Chumakov became a corresponding member, and in 1960 a full member of Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. Beginning in the 1940s Chumakov organized multiple medical expeditions to Siberia and other regions of the Soviet Union to investigate outbreaks caused by new viruses. Among viruses discovered and studied by Chumakov are Omsk hemorrhagic fever and Kemerovo fever viruses,[2] hantavirus causing renal syndrome, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus, and many others.  From 1950 he was the Director of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow. In 1952 as a part of the anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet Union known as Doctors' plot he was removed from the Ivanovsky Institute for refusal to fire Jewish associates. In 1955 he organized a new research institute near Moscow to work on vaccines against poliomyelitis. His work on vaccines against poliomyelitis was done in close collaboration with American scientists including Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin.[3]  In 1958-1959 he and his wife Marina Voroshilova organized the first mass production and clinical trials of Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV)[4] made from live attenuated strains developed by Albert Sabin.[5][6] This made the Soviet Union the first country to develop, produce, license and widely use this highly effective vaccine that practically eliminated poliomyelitis from the country in the first few years of its use. The vaccine produced by Chumakov's Institute was exported into more than 60 countries, and was instrumental in stopping large outbreaks of poliomyelitis in Eastern Europe and Japan. The success of the Russian clinical trials was critical to OPV licensing in the United States in 1962, and the vaccine becoming the main tool used in global poliomyelitis eradication campaign. Chumakov also created a number of other human and veterinarian vaccines, including inactivated vaccine against TBE, measles, influenza and vaccine against Canine distemper virus that is widely used to protect farmed fur animals. Chumakov published more than 960 research papers, scholarly articles and books./nChumakov held an Honoris Causa degree from Academia Leopoldina in Germany and was an Honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

The main protagonist of the series' third story arc, Stardust Crusaders, Jotaro is depicted as a rough delinquent with a noble heart who journeys from Japan to Egypt with his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and their allies to defeat the Joestar bloodline's sworn enemy, DIO, and save his mother's life. He has a Stand (a physical manifestation of his fighting spirit) named Star Platinum (\u661f\u306e\u767d\u91d1, Sut\u0101 Purachina), whose power is incredible strength, speed, and precision.

Jotaro also appears briefly in Golden Wind when he sends Koichi Hirose to Italy to spy on DIO's son, Giorno Giovanna, and in Stone Ocean to aid his daughter Jolyne Cujoh against the forces of Enrico Pucci. The siblings Yoshikage and Kei Kira take his place in the Joestar family tree in the alternate universe of JoJolion./nAraki wanted the protagonist of Stardust Crusaders to be Japanese when Phantom Blood was serializing and intended for Jotaro to be stoic to differentiate him from Jonathan and Joseph. The character was also inspired by American actor Clint Eastwood. In order to make the story more appealing, Araki created characters who would not overlap with Jotaro's characterization. Jotaro was voiced by J\u016br\u014dta Kosugi in the original video animation adaptation of Stardust Crusaders and by Abie Hadjitarkhani in its English dub. In the later television anime adaptation and in the rest of his occurrences in future parts, he was voiced by Daisuke Ono in Japanese and Matthew Mercer in English./nCritic and fan reception to Jotaro's character has been positive, with Araki himself stating that Jotaro has become so well known that he could act as a \"synonym\" for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure as a whole. Critics have praised his stoic personality and heroic actions, and although some reviewers noted Jotaro to be overpowered, others found his fights appealing and unique, such as the gambling battle with Daniel J. D'Arby./nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure creator Hirohiko Araki decided to have a Japanese main character for Part 3 around the ending of the manga's first part.[1] When Araki started working on Stardust Crusaders, his primary goal was to create characters with different personalities compared to those from Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, the previous parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure; for instance, whereas Jonathan from Phantom Blood is a traditional portrayal of a man of justice, and Joseph from Battle Tendency is a \"cheerful and flashy\" character, Jotaro keeps his emotions hidden, with the art of him depicting him as expressionless as possible. He was additionally designed to be taller and have more of a sense of weight to his body compared to Jonathan and Joseph, to make him seem fantastical, while his clothing \u2013 a school uniform \u2013 was meant to represent normalcy.[2] Jotaro was additionally designed to symbolize the part's story and setting.[3] Araki modeled Jotaro after American actor Clint Eastwood, including his poses and catchphrases; Jotaro's signature finger-pointing pose came from one of Eastwood's poses with a .44 Magnum. His catchphrase \"good grief\" (\u3084\u308c\u3084\u308c\u3060\u305c, yare yare daze) was also an imitation of the type of lines Eastwood would say in his movies.[1] Araki intended for Jotaro to be economical in his movements, and have \"a presence that could be felt just by him standing\".[2] This is why the character might seem \"rough\" compared to other Weekly Shonen Jump protagonists; however, Jotaro fits Araki's own image of a hero perfectly as a \"loner\" who does not do the right thing for attention. The author said the character wearing his school uniform in the desert has its roots in Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Babel II. Araki wrote that Jotaro has become \"big enough\" that he can act as a synonym for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure as a whole. He also revealed that he has based the visual designs of subsequent JoJos on Jotaro's and then worked to differentiate them from there.[1]/nOther characters in Part 3 were written to contrast with Jotaro. Because Joseph was also the \"JoJo\" of his own story arc, Araki made sure to make it clear that Jotaro was the main character of Stardust Crusaders.[4] Araki stated that he had Kakyoin act as a foil to Jotaro. Although they both wear school uniforms, Kakyoin's well-tailored one gives him the feel of an honor student, while Jotaro's loose-fitting uniform and accessories convey that he is a delinquent. He made Kakyoin Jotaro's first real Stand opponent to visually convey the concepts between short-range and long-range Stand abilities.[5] In order to have him not overlap with Jotaro and Joseph, Polnareff was given a distinctive look and personality, which in turn made him stand out in the group.[6]/nIn Japanese, Jotaro was voiced by J\u016br\u014dta Kosugi in the OVAs,[7] but has been voiced by Daisuke Ono since JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle. Ono first learned of the series when he was studying in college during his free time and came to enjoy the manga. He felt pressure when doing Jotaro's voice, stating that \"Jotaro's a representative character of the series.\" The audition process for the Stardust Crusaders television series was separate from that of the game he previously worked on. Ono had to re-audition for Jotaro's character. He further said \"Jotaro is a character who's cool and collected and on the verge of boiling over all at the same time. He takes those two contradictory elements and makes them work together at a high level.\"[8]/nIn English, Jotaro was voiced by Abie Hadjitarkhani in the OVAs,[9] and Matthew Mercer in the television anime.[10] Mercer first learned of the series at an anime convention in 1996, where he was impressed by an episode of Jotaro facing Dio. As a result, Mercer becoming Jotaro's English actor was, according to him, \"a huge nerd full circle.\" In the recording of the early episodes, Mercer was excited with the lines he was given.[11] In the pilot episodes of the dub, while Jotaro was still voiced by Mercer, his Stand, Star Platinum, was voiced by Dio's voice actor, Patrick Seitz. Mercer would become the official voice for Star Platinum after the pilot episodes.[12]/nA Japanese high school delinquent, Jotaro Kujo, appears as the protagonist of Stardust Crusaders. Jotaro has been arrested, and refuses to leave his cell, believing he is possessed by an evil spirit.[13] After being called by Holly, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother, Joseph arrives with an associate, Mohammed Avdol. They explain that Jotaro's \"evil spirit\" is actually a manifestation of his fighting spirit, called a Stand, and reveal that they possess Stands as well. Joseph explains that the sudden appearance of their Stands is caused by the nemesis of his grandfather, Jonathan Joestar: DIO.[14] Soon after, Jotaro defeats the first of these assassins, Noriaki Kakyoin, managing to rescue him from the influence of DIO's parasitic flesh bud.[15][16] Holly soon becomes gravely ill due to a Stand manifesting in her, which is slowly killing her due to her reserved personality. With little hesitation, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, and Kakyoin begin a journey to Egypt to kill DIO and save Holly's life.[17] On the way, they are joined by another reformed assassin named Jean Pierre Polnareff, who seeks to avenge his sister, whose murderer is among DIO's forces[18] and Iggy, a troublesome dog who developed a Stand and was captured by Avdol offscreen.[19]/nAfter Avdol and Iggy are murdered by DIO's right-hand Vanilla Ice,[20][21] the remainders of the group ultimately find Dio and unnerved by his unknown power, escape his mansion as the sun sets.[22][23] A chase across Cairo follows, leading to Kakyoin confronting Dio and his Stand, The World.[22][24] Though fatally wounded by The World, Kakyoin deduces the Stand's ability to stop time for a few seconds and relays it to Joseph by using Emerald Splash on a nearby clock tower before dying.[25][23] Joseph is able to pass that information on to Jotaro,[26][23] but is also fatally wounded by Dio, who uses his blood to increase the duration of his ability.[27][23] Jotaro then fights DIO alone, slowly discovering that he shares DIO's time-stopping ability, due to Star Platinum having similar abilities to The World. The battle ends with Jotaro defeating Dio using the time-stop ability and subsequently killing him,[28][23] before transfusing DIO's blood back into Joseph, and destroying the vampire for good by exposing his remains to the sun. Jotaro and Joseph then bid Polnareff farewell before returning to Japan, as Holly has made a full recovery.[29][23]/nIn the fourth story arc, Diamond Is Unbreakable, Jotaro arrives in the Japanese town of Morioh to meet Josuke Higashikata after finding out the latter is Joseph's illegitimate son, intending to inform him of this fact and work out his inheritance.[30] Soon after, along with Josuke, Koichi Hirose and Okuyasu Nijimura, they investigate to find the identity of Red Hot Chili Pepper's Stand user, Akira Otoishi,[31] who stole the Stand-granting Bow and Arrow after killing Keicho Nijimura, Okuyasu's brother.[32] Afterwards, Manga artist Rohan Kishibe finds out about a serial killer loose in Morioh from the ghost of one of his victims, Remi Sugimoto.[33] The killer, Yoshikage Kira, goes on to kill Shigekiyo Yangu, a student at Josuke's school, causing Jotaro and the rest of the group to grow suspicious.[34] After almost managing to catch him by following a clue he left behind after Shigekiyo's murder, he barely escapes after a violent battle and assumes the new identity of local businessman Kosaku Kawajiri by using Aya Tsuji's Stand ability.[35] After his identity is eventually discovered by Josuke, Kira attempts to use a paramedic to activate his Stand Killer Queen's new ability, Bites the Dust, and rewind time, but is stopped by Koichi and Jotaro.[36] Kira is then accidentally run over by an arriving ambulance and dies.[37] Following the battle, Jotaro leaves Morioh with an older Joseph Joestar who joined him in his adventure earlier.[38]/nIn Golden Wind, Jotaro asks Koichi to go on a mission to Italy. His objective was to get a skin sample of a boy named Haruno Shiobana, which would then be given to the Speedwagon Foundation for analysis.[39] Sometime later, Koichi reported back to Jotaro that Haruno Shiobana, who now goes by Giorno Giovanna, was a Stand user. Jotaro then revealed to Koichi that Giorno was the son of Dio and wanted to get the skin sample to confirm this. However, now knowing that he was a Stand user, Jotaro called off the mission.[40]/nIn Stone Ocean, Jotaro comes to visit his imprisoned daughter, Jolyne Cujoh,[41] and informs her that a disciple of Dio's framed her so that he could kill her in prison, and urges her to escape.[42] This plan goes awry when a Stand named Whitesnake uses its power to remove Jotaro's Stand and memories, in the form of discs.[43] Jotaro sinks into a deathlike state, and Jolyne vows find a way to recover the discs from Whitesnake's user, the mysterious prison chaplain Enrico Pucci.[44]/nShe succeeds in sending both of Jotaro's discs to the Speedwagon Foundation.[45][46] Jotaro arrives to defend Jolyne and her friends from Pucci. However, Pucci is able to survive and realizes he can use his new Stand C-Moon to replicate the gravitational conditions required for his plan.[47] Unlocking his ultimate stand, Made in Heaven, Pucci speeds up time itself causing the rapid acceleration of the world around Pucci and the Joestar group to create a new universe in his and DIO\u2019s image.[48][49]   Pucci aims Made in Heaven to maneuver Jolyne's Stand Stone Free into successfully killing her ally Narciso Anasui, but Jotaro is able to stop time. Made in Heaven greatly shortens Jotaro's time stop, and upon saving Jolyne from Pucci's attack, Jotaro and Ermes Costello are killed in front of Emporio Alni\u00f1o,[50] and Jolyne gives her life so Emporio can survive.[51]/nThe universe then promptly collapses, or \"runs out of time\". Although Pucci accelerates time once more, creating a new universe, where everything is the same but people have precognition and \"fate\", Emporio uses Weather Report to kill Pucci. The universe collapses, and another cycle of time leads to a new universe with no precognition and no Pucci. In this new universe, Emporio meet reincarnated Jolyne, Ermes, Anasui, and Weather Report who all go by different names, and with Pucci never existing they never go to jail. Irene and Annakiss, the reincarnations of Jolyne and Anasui, plan to meet reincarnated Jotaro for his approval on their planned marriage.[52]/nJotaro Kujo himself does not appear in the new universe that began with Steel Ball Run outside of a cameo in a volume-exclusive interlude detailing the mechanics and limitations of Stand abilities. His place in the Joestar bloodline is taken over by the 29-year-old marine surgeon Yoshikage Kira and the 22-year-old housekeeper Kei Kira who takes on the last name Nijimura to disguise her identity. Both infiltrate the Higashikata family to heal their mother Holly Joestar-Kira and end up murdered by the villainous Rock Humans throughout the story, set in 2011, with Holly remaining comatose at the plot\u00b4s conclusion. The siblings share visual and personality traits with Jotaro but have their own Stands unrelated to Star Platinum. Yoshikage wealds a new version of Killer Queen and Kei possesses the autonomous Born This Way./nYoshikage Kira lives on through JoJolion\u00b4s protagonist Josuke Higashikata, whose body is a 50/50 equivalent exchange fusion of the mortally wounded Yoshikage and his decade-younger friend Josefumi Kujo. Josuke continues to follow their goal to heal Holly after regaining his memories and swears during the ending to pursue this further despite coming to the conclusion that he is his own person./nJotaro appears in the live-action adaption of Diamond is Unbreakable, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I, portrayed by Yusuke Iseya.[53]/nJotaro is a playable character in the following games: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993) for the Super Famicom, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle,[54] it's remake JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R,[55] and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Last Survivor.[56]/nHe also appears in the video game JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven.[57][58] In the story mode Jotaro and his allies, who had just defeated Dio, are attacked by friends and enemies who have either disappeared or died along the way. They are then approached by a young Robert E. O. Speedwagon, who possesses a piece of the Saint's Corpse that allows him to travel through time and space as well as vanquish the evil influence possessing the other characters. He leads Jotaro and his allies on a journey through time, space, and alternate universes, in order to stop another iteration of Dio. This alternate Dio defeated his timeline's version of the Joestars and has attained a Stand known as \"The World: Over Heaven\", which allows him to rewrite reality. Though Dio succeeds in absorbing the souls of the Joestar lineage and the Saint's Corpse parts, Jotaro manages to defeat him as his Stand develops the same powers since it is the same Stand as The World. After killing Heaven Ascension Dio, Jotaro uses his new powers to rewrite his timeline so that the Joestars and their allies who died in Parts 1-7 survived. He is also shown attempting to be a better father to Jolyne, even bringing her to Morioh with him during the events of Part 4./nThe character of Jotaro is also present in the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump crossover games Famicom Jump II: Saiky\u014d no Shichinin, Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars, and Jump Force.[59]/nJotaro in his Stone Ocean appearance and a limited starter pack with him and Jolyne as one character is one of the playable characters of Monster Strike, from July 15 to August 2, 2022 in a collaboration with the anime adaptation of Stone Ocean[60] and in his Stardust Crusaders appearance is a playable character of Puzzle & Dragons in collaborations of the anime and the game's 10th anniversaries from December 26, 2022 to January 9, 2023.[61][62]/nCritical reception to Jotaro's character has been positive. Joel Loynds of The Linc enjoyed the distinct personalities of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, pointing out how Jotaro's stoicness contrasts with Joseph.[63] Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network enjoyed seeing Part 2's Joseph team up with Jotaro[64] and noted another element in the narrative was Jotaro's responsibility when dealing with an innocent girl who might act as a weak point. The reviewer suggested a parallel between her and Jotaro and Joseph and Caesar in the previous arc where \"ultimately Caesar's protection of Joseph cost him his life.\"[65] Jordan Richards of AIPT Comics finds Jotaro to be the one the reviewer likes the most out of the characters introduced due to how despite how his introduction making him seem lime an unruly delinquent, he has moments that shows his kindness such as willingly putting himself in jail when unaware of his Stand\u2019s nature and his desire to save her life despite his rudeness towards her.[66] Gita Jackson of Kotaku liked Jotaro's design, and joked about how the hat is always worn.[67] David King of Bubbleblabber praises Matthew Mercer's portrayal of Jotaro for capturing his rough personality.[68]/nJoel Loynds of The Linc praises his Stand, Star Platinum, due to how it fights alongside Jotaro using a barrage of multiple punches while Jotaro constantly yells the Japanese word \"Ora\".[63] Ian Wolf of Anime UK News praised the fight Jotaro has with the gambler D'Arby, finding it unique among fight sequences presented in shonen demographic as rather than employing brutality, they instead play poker.[69] On the other hand, Nick Creamer from Anime News Network felt that Jotaro was too overpowered due to how he often defeats enemies using brute force in early episodes of Part 3.[70] William Irvine of The Little Hawk feels Jotaro's reveal to be able to stop time as a cop-out as there are barely moments that hints to it and it makes his and Dio's battle as being forced. However, the reviewer notes that their battle is entertaining with some of the best moments to come out of it of the series.[71]/nDespite not reaching legal smoking age for Japan in Stardust Crusaders, Jotaro often smokes in the manga series. When the series was adapted into a television series, Jotaro's face was covered in black when smoking. Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku found this censorship as one of the most ridiculous ever done in anime as even though Jotaro's face is covered, his cigar can be clearly seen.[72] Eric Gaede of THEM Anime Reviews criticized how the OVAs primarily focused on Jotaro rather than his allies and criticized his constant yelling when facing Dio.[73]/nThe Fandom Post enjoyed Jotaro's inclusion in Part 4 and how the characters had to find other antistereotypical ways to defeat villains that avoided brute force.[74] Manga.Tokyo enjoyed the meeting between Jotaro and Josuke for going from an interesting conversation about the Joestar bloodline to an intense fight scene when the former insults the latter's hair.[75] Anime News Network praised how Jotaro interacts with the lead of Part 4, Josuke, finding both characters appealing.[76] David Kalsof of Bubbleblabber enjoys the relationship between Jotaro and Josuke, highlighting their unusual familial relations and the mentor role he displays to the teenager.[77] In a Diamond is Unbreakable festival event, Daisuke Ono performed Jotaro's catchphrase, a multitude of \"ora\"s. Manga\u2013.Tokyo described it as \"a moment any JoJo fan wouldn't want to miss\".[78]/nIn retrospect, Thrilist commented that Jotaro possessed several positive qualities which are in parallel with his daughter during Stone Ocean.[79] IGN felt that Jotaro's decay in Stone Ocean provided an interesting premise for Jolyne to explore in this storyline as she was also felt to be in possession of a Stand more interesting to see play than Star Platinum.[80] Both Polygon and Anime Feminist agreed that Jotaro had become a typical poor father figure to Jolyne, a common trend that anime and manga explore though the former enjoyed how during the series, father and daughter have to work together to defeat the villain showing in the process a more caring side to his persona.[81][82] Jose Arroyo of The Review Geek in the review of the first batch dislikes how quickly their relationship has resolved as he believes there are barely any emotional moments between the two that is deserving of Jolyne's forgiveness and it ends up being rushed and unearned.[83] Thus, in his review of the second batch, he praises the handling her newfound appreciation towards Jotaro better as it includes a heartfelt moment between the two.[84] Jose Arroyo's review during the third batch expresses happiness of Jotaro and Jolyne's reunion and Jotaro witnessing her maturity and showcasing his pride.[85]/nJotaro has been used as a piece of merchandise including super action figures,[86] Nendoroids,[87][88] earphones sets,[89] clothes,[90][91][92] smart watches,[93] and chocolates.[94] An attraction in Cinema 4-D based on the fight between Jotaro and Dio Brando had been created by Universal Studios Japan.[95][96] IGN listed Jotaro as one of the best anime characters of all time.[97]", "35251889": "Paul Workman FRS FRSC FMedSci (born 30 March 1952) is a British scientist noted for his work on the discovery and development of pharmaceutical agents in the field of oncology.[1] He is President and CEO of The Institute of Cancer Research In London./nWorkman was born on 30 March 1952 in Workington, Cumbria, England.[2] He was educated at Workington County Grammar School, Cumbria, and completed his BSc degree in Biochemistry at the University of Leicester and his PhD degree in Cancer Pharmacology at the University of Leeds.

Leblond is notable for developing autoradiography and his work showing how cells continuously renew themselves, regardless of age./nIn 1946, Leblond found that, when he poured liquid photographic emulsion on a histological section containing a radio element, the emulsion was eventually activated by the radio-element; and if thereafter routine photographic development and fixation were applied to the emulsion-covered section, black silver grains appeared in the emulsion wherever it overlay sites containing a radio-element. This liquid emulsion approach has been used to develop a new High Resolution Autoradiography procedure[2] characterized by close contact between emulsion and section. Such close contact makes it possible to localize the radio-elements in the section at high resolution, so that radio-elements can be localized at high magnification in the light microscope.[3][4]/nThis procedure has been utilized to examine some of the dynamic features of body components, with the main findings as follows:/nHis results threw doubt on the validity of three traditional concepts dear to biologists in the earlier part of the twentieth century: \"stability\" of the cell, in which the cell and its components are unchanging, permanent structures; \"specificity\" of cell function, in which each cell type has a distinct, unique function; and \"activity-rest alternation\" of cell function, in which each period of cellular activity is followed by a period during which the activity ceases./nHe has proposed replacing cell \"specificity\" by \"multipotentiality\", \"activity-rest alternation\" by \"continuity\" and \"stability\" of cell components by \"renewal\". These various results have provided the foundation not only for modern stem cell research, but also for modern cell biology./nAs Nobel laureate George Palade noted on the occasion of the 1992 Prix Marie-Victorin to Leblond, Charles Leblond's discoveries are so fundamental that they are taught in schools and colleges throughout the world.[5]/nCP Leblond was born in Lille, France, in 1910, the son of a building contractor who died when Leblond was only 10 years old, leaving his mother to raise four boys on her own. A brilliant student, Leblond debated becoming a film producer, an architect or a scientist. In the end, he decided on science, and enrolled in Medicine at the University of Paris. He was fascinated by his first course in histology and decided to pursue this field as a career./nLeblond obtained his M.D. degree from the University of Paris in 1934. His doctoral thesis described the histochemical localizion of ascorbic acid, which he found to predominate in steroid-secreting cells.[6] This study led him, with a Rockefeller postdoctoral fellowship in hand, to the endocrinology-orientated Department of Anatomy at Yale University in 1935, where he carried out studies on factors influencing maternal behavior.[7] It was here that he met his wife Gertrude Sternschuss, to whom he was married for 64 years. Leblond had 4 children for which he chose names starting with the letter \"P\": Philippe, Paul, Pierre and (Marie)-Pascale. He also had 7 grandchildren./nIn 1937, Leblond joined the Laboratoire de Synthese Atomique in Paris which was involved in preparing radioactive isotopes for use in investigating the fate of various molecules in biological processes. Under the guidance of Antoine Lacassagne, Leblond injected radioiodine-128, into a rat and found that the label promptly accumulated in the thyroid gland, presumably incorporated into the thyroid hormone precursor thyroglobulin.[8] To localize this label more precisely within the thyroid tissue, Leblond attempted to use the novel technique of autoradiography./nUnfortunately, Leblond's first attempt to use autoradiography failed, the reason being that the radioiodine-128 isotope, with its extremely short half-life (25 minutes), disintegrated so quickly that too little radioactivity remained to be detected by the photographic emulsion./nIn 1941, Leblond moved to McGill University as a lecturer in histology, and quickly rose to assistant (1943), associate (1946), and then full professor of anatomy (1948). He served as the chair of the Department of Anatomy from 1957\u20131974./nAt McGill, Leblond used the newly-available radioiodine-131 with a half-life of 8 days, to repeat his autoradiographic experiment on thyroid tissue. With this method, the resolving power was less than 100\u00a0\u00b5m, but nonetheless he was able to localize the radioactivity to specific thyroid [follicles].[9]/nLeblond's early career at McGill was interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the Free French Forces. He was dispatched first to Rio de Janeiro, then to London, where he conducted medical exams of would-be soldiers./n\"In 1946, after returning to Montreal from service with the Free French Forces, it was clear to me that the crude technique previously used for radioautography had to be improved\".[10] In collaboration with Leonard B\u00e9langer, Leblond worked on increasing the resolution of the autoradiographic technique. They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution.[11] Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion.[12] The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone./nHigh Resolution Autoradiography procedure continues to be used today by molecular biologists to detect RNA molecules in situ, and to study the localization of genes and DNA sequences./nLeblond used autoradiography to introduce radioactive precursors of DNA and then examine the renewal and fate of cells of several basic tissue types. He demonstrated for the first time that most cells and tissues in the adult body undergo continued renewal. Using mathematical models and modern methods of quantitation, Leblond and his colleagues estimated with remarkable accuracy the turnover and mitotic rates of numerous cell types. He and his colleagues made fascinating discoveries that resulted in the introduction of \"time dimension\" to cells and tissues, opening the doors to the understanding of the cell cycle and to the identification of stem cells./nIn the male seminiferous epithelium, studies by Leblond and Yves Clermont in the early 1950s had deciphered how spermatogonia gave rise to spermatocytes, which then differentiated into mature sperm cells in a specific cycle.[13][14]/nTo maintain the population of spermatogonia, the seminiferous epithelium was shown to contain a population of stem cells which divided to produce differentiated cells as well as to maintain their own number. As noted in a seminal publication by Leblond, \"the reappearance at each cycle of a new dormant cell which acts as the stem cell of spermatocytes is described as the 'Stem Cell Renewal Theory'\" . This article is the first one in which nests of cells dividing in an adult organ are designated as \"stem cells\".[15]/nLeblond and his colleagues also found evidence for the presence of occasional adult stem cells even in tissues which are composed almost entirely of non-dividing cells. In skeletal muscle, the muscle fibers had been shown to exhibit an age-related increase in the number of nuclei.[16] His studies showed that muscle satellite cells could be considered to be adult stem cells in muscle fibers./nFrom the studies of Leblond and his colleagues, it was concluded that the body has three types of cell populations:/nTo mark his 65th birthday in 1975, Leblond was honored at an international symposium on the existence of stem cells in adult tissues; the resulting book, Stem Cells of Renewing Cell Populations, was the first formal, comprehensive account on the subject.[17]/nWhen Leblond and his colleagues used 14C-bicarbonate, and then 35S-labeled amino acids to investigate protein synthesis, they were astonished to find that virtually all cells in the body incorporated label.[18][19] This led them to the conclusion, considered heretical at the time, that all cells continually synthesized proteins. This was among the first evidence to replace the Specificity concept with the idea that most cells are multipotential in their functions./nIt is of interest that autoradiographic studies by Leblond during this period also settled a controversy regarding the cellular site of synthesis of ribonucleic acid. Using radiolabeled cytidine in some forty cell types, he and his colleagues were the first to demonstrate decisively that RNA is continuously synthesized in the nucleus and then migrates to the cytoplasm.[20][21]/nA majority of body proteins is glycosylated, although the proportion of carbohydrates in proteins is quite variable. Leblond had shown in earlier studies that the Golgi region in most cell types was dramatically stained by the periodic acid-Schiff staining technique, which is specially directed to carbohydrate-rich proteins carrying 1,2 glycols.[14][22] In the electron microscope, using the periodic acid silver technique, there was a gradient of staining intensity from the cis to the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, suggesting that carbohydrate residues were added to proteins at this site.[23]/nTo test this hypothesis, light and then EM autoradiographic studies were carried out by Leblond and Neutra in 1966 after injecting rats with 3H-glucose or 3H-galactose.[24][25] Within ten minutes, the label was dramatically localized to the Golgi apparatus of intestinal goblet cells, indicating that this was the cellular site of addition of sugar residues in the synthesis of the carbohydrate side chains of mucous glycoproteins./nThis discovery had a tremendous impact on the scientific community, being the first evidence for a functional role of the Golgi apparatus in the synthetic process./nOther classics include: identification of how skeletal bones grow through osteoblast deposition and osteoclast remodeling,[26] early discovery of the biogenesis and metabolism of thyroxine[27] and detection of triiodothyronine,[28] early prediction of DNA semiconservative replication[29] published days after the Watson and Crick Nature article,[30] the discovery of axonal transport,[31] the Warshawsky et al.[32] finding that nascent proteins are processed from the rough endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus into pancreatic zymogen granules (made in hot competition with the Palade lab at Rockefeller University), the first realization that the Golgi apparatus is the site of terminal glycosylation,[33] the discovery of the cell coat,[34] the cellular biogenesis of collagen,[35] and new insights into the ultrastructure of basement membrane.[36]/nAt 65, instead of retiring, Leblond continued his research with an NIH Fogarty Scholarship at the National Institute of Dental Research, where he learned about immunohistochemistry. This launched a twenty-year molecular exploration culminating in the concept of the basement membrane as an integrated polymer,[36] rather than as layers of separated macromolecules initially favored by others./nLeblond continued to attend all weekly departmental seminars well into his 90s and continued to publish in peer-reviewed journals into the new millennium. He learned to use a computer at age 90, starting a presentation at an international conference back in 2004, by noting: \"A month ago, I thought PowerPoint was a tool for sharpening pencils.\"/nHis total contributions resulted in the publication of 430 scientific papers, many of them still frequently cited. In late September 2006, he published his final article\u2014about detecting the MMP9 cysteine activation switch for the first time in remodeling cartilage.[37]/nLeblond was preceded in death by his wife of 64 years, Gertrude Sternschuss, who died in 2000. After Gertrude died, Leblond married a childhood friend, Odette Lengrand, in 2001; they were both 91. Odette died in 2004.", "69199590": "Curtis A.

He completed a thesis he described as \"replicating American work\" on the effectiveness of the antibiotic against local infections, and became a medical doctor in 1947.  Though attracted to research as a career, he was discouraged by his own perceived ignorance after attending a microbiology congress that summer.  Instead, he took a position at the Cabanel Center, where he had done his thesis research; his new work entailed the manufacture of an antibiotic, tyrothricin.  Later, the center was contracted to convert gunpowder factories for penicillin production (though this proved impossible).[11]/nAlso in this period, he met and began courting his future wife, Lise Bloch.[12] Jacob remarried in 1999 to Genevi\u00e8ve Barrier.[13]/nIn 1961 Jacob and Monod explored the idea that the control of enzyme expression levels in cells is a result of regulation of transcription of DNA sequences. Their experiments and ideas gave impetus to the emerging field of molecular developmental biology, and of transcriptional regulation in particular./nFor many years it had been known that bacterial and other cells could respond to external conditions by regulating levels of their key metabolic enzymes, and/or the activity of these enzymes. For instance, if a bacterium finds itself in a broth containing lactose, rather than the simpler sugar glucose, it must adapt itself to the need to 1) import lactose, 2) cleave lactose to its constituents glucose and galactose, and 3) convert the galactose to glucose. It was known that cells ramp up their production of the enzymes that do these steps when exposed to lactose, rather than wastefully producing these enzymes all the time. Studies of enzyme activity control were progressing through theories of the (allosteric) action of small molecules on the enzyme molecule itself (switching it on or off), but the method of controlling the enzyme production was not well understood at the time./nWith the earlier determination of the structure and central importance of DNA, it became clear that all proteins were being produced in some way from its genetic code, and that this step might form a key control point. Jacob and Monod made key experimental and theoretical discoveries that demonstrated that in the case of the lactose system outlined above (in the bacterium E. coli), there are specific proteins that are devoted to repressing the transcription of the DNA to its product (RNA, which in turn is decoded into protein)./nThis repressor (the lac repressor) is made in all cells, binding directly to DNA at the genes it controls, and physically preventing the transcription apparatus from gaining access to the DNA. In the presence of lactose, some of the lactose is converted to allolactose, which binds to the repressor making it no longer able to bind to DNA, and the transcriptional repression is lifted. In this way, a robust feedback loop is constructed that allows the set of lactose-digesting proteins products to be made only when they are needed./nJacob and Monod extended this repressor model to all genes in all organisms in their initial exuberance. The regulation of gene activity has developed into a very large sub-discipline of molecular biology, and in truth exhibits enormous variety in mechanism and many levels of complexity. Current researchers find regulatory events at every conceivable level of the processes that express genetic information. In the relatively simple genome of baker's yeast, (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), 405 of its 6,419 protein-encoding genes are directly involved in transcriptional control, compared to 1,938 that are enzymes.", "38233859": "Yehudith Birk (30 September 1926 \u2013 14 January 2013) was a Polish-born Israeli biochemist, awarded the 1998 Israel Prize for agricultural research.[1]/nYehudith Gershtanski (later Birk) was born in Grajewo, Poland to Frida (n\u00e9e Borowitz; 1895\u20131974) and Yitzhak Gershtanski (1890\u20131950), both ardent  Zionist activists.

Over the next three years they examined about 20,000 mutated fly families, collected about 600 mutants with an altered body pattern and found that out of the approximately 5,000 essential genes only 120 were essential for early development. In October 1980, they published the mere 15 genes controlling the segmented pattern of the Drosophila larva.[5]/nIn 1981, N\u00fcsslein-Volhard moved to the Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society in T\u00fcbingen. \nFrom 1984 until her retirement in 2014, she was the director of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen and also led its genetics department.

The foundation's main focus is to facilitate childcare as a supplement to existing stipends and day care.[4]/nDuring the late 1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s, little was known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which multicellular organisms develop from single cells to morphologically complex forms during embryogenesis. N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus identified genes involved in embryonic development by a series of \u00a0genetic screens, generating random mutations in fruit flies using ethyl methanesulfonate. Some of these mutations affected genes involved in the development of the embryo. They took advantage of the segmented form of Drosophila larvae to address the logic of the genes controlling development. They looked at the pattern of segments and denticles in each mutant under the microscope, and were therefore able to work out that particular genes were involved in different processes during development based on their differing mutant phenotypes (such as fewer segments, gaps in the normal segment pattern, and alterations in the patterns of denticles on the segments). Many of these genes were given descriptive names based on the appearance of the mutant larvae, such as hedgehog, gurken (German: \"cucumbers\"), and Kr\u00fcppel ( \"cripple\").[10] Later, researchers Pavel Tomancal, Amy Beaton, et. Al, identified exactly which gene had been affected by each mutation, thereby identifying a set of genes crucial for Drosophila embryogenesis./nThe subsequent study of these mutants and their interactions led to important new insights into early Drosophila development, especially the mechanisms that underlie the step-wise development of body segments.[11] These experiments are not only distinguished by their sheer scale (with the methods available at the time, they involved an enormous workload), but more importantly by their significance for organisms other than fruit flies./nHer findings led to important realizations about evolution \u2013 for example, that protostomes and deuterostomes are likely to have had a relatively well-developed common ancestor with a much more complex body plan than had been conventionally thought./nAdditionally, they greatly increased our understanding of the regulation of transcription, as well as cell fate during development.[citation needed]/nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard is associated with the discovery of Toll, which led to the identification of toll-like receptors.[12]/nAs of 2023[update], N\u00fcsslein-Volhard has an h-index of 104 according to Scopus.[13]/nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard married in the mid-1960s while studying at the Goethe University Frankfurt, but divorced soon afterward and did not have any children.[5] She lives in Bebenhausen, Germany.[14] She has said that she loves to sing, play the flute and do chamber music.[6] She published a cookbook in 2006.[15]/nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard has been awarded honorary degrees by the following Universities: Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Rockefeller, Utrecht, University College London, Oxford (June 2005), Sheffield, St Andrews (June 2011), Freiburg, Munich and Bath (July 2012).[32][33]", "64612122": "Christina Messineo Annunziata is an American medical oncologist researching molecular signal transduction in ovarian cancer.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989./nArthur James Cain was awarded an open scholarship in 1939 (Demyship) to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated with first class honors in zoology in 1941. Entering the British Army in December 1941, Cain was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (engineering) and was later transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (R.E.M.E.) on its formation. He was promoted to captain in 1942./nAfter leaving the military in November 1945 Cain returned to Oxford to pursue research in the Department of Zoology. He became a Departmental Demonstrator in October 1946, and received his M.A. in November 1947. From January 1949 until 1964 Cain was employed as University Demonstrator (now referred to as Lecturer) in Animal Taxonomy./nCain's main interests lay in evolutionary biology, ecological genetics, animal taxonomy and speciation./nThough he conducted research with John Baker on the histochemistry of lipids, his main work lay in the field developed by E.B. Ford, namely, ecological genetics. With P.M. Sheppard, Cain studied the ecological genetics of colour and banding polymorphisms in snails. Cain and Sheppard's work on Cepaea nemoralis, one of the first studies to demonstrate natural selection by predators acting on a colour polymorphism, is now regarded as a classic. It generated a long series of further studies by Cain, including the formal genetic analysis of the variation, the discovery of area effects and the analysis of climatic influences. With John Currey he made elegant use of sub-fossil material to follow changes in time as well as space. Later he turned to the study of variation in shell shape./nIn population genetics he clarified the concept of adaptive value. He made important contributions to the theory and practice of taxonomy, the problems of homology, phyletic weighting and taxonomic importance, on the status of the genus, and on the relevance of natural selection to our understanding of variation between taxonomic categories./nCain was appointed Curator of the Zoological Collections at the Oxford University Museum in 1954, a position he held for ten years in addition to his duties as university lecturer and as lecturer in zoology at Saint Peter's College (1958\u20131961). In 1964, he left Oxford to become professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, and he later (1968) was appointed derby professor of zoology at the University of Liverpool. He received emeritus status at Liverpool upon his retirement in 1989.[2]/nTowards the end of his life Cain was persuaded to reminisce about the status of natural selection in pre-war Oxford and how it changed over the years of the modern evolutionary synthesis.[3][4] The general attitude was sceptical of natural selection. Charles Elton, who led the emergence of ecology as a discipline, pointed out the Arctic fox polymorphism, which can be found in all three tundra biomes of the northern palaeoarctic. Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) are dimorphic: the common morph ('white') is white in winter and brownish-grey dorsally in summer; the other morph ('blue') is light brown/blue in winter and dark brown in summer. The two morphs interbreed freely. Despite the obvious advantage of white in avoiding predation, blue is actually the most frequent morph in Iceland. Elton also gave a number of other examples which he claimed could not be explained by natural selection.[5]/nAlso, Robson and Richards[7] \"showed a surprising reluctance to allow any example of natural selection; their cautious qualification that characters were non-adaptive as far as they could see became, too often, a certainty that they were non-adaptive; and their arguments were sometimes one-sided.\" Cain laid the blame on their \"vitalistic or perhaps theistic attitudes... Robson and Richards were far from alone. Alister Hardy... was an earnest Unitarian and certainly a vitalist\" (p7)... In Cambridge matters were even worse\" (p8, giving as examples W.H. Thorpe, Charles Raven, Sir James Gray and J.W.S. Pringle)./nHe might have added, had he known them, Ronald Fisher and Theodosius Dobzhansky, who were also believing Christians: Fisher from the start of his career was a leading proponent of natural selection./nIn contrast to many others, E.B. Ford appreciated that, even if a character was in itself non-adaptive, the gene or genes determining it might affect other, adaptive, characters which were always under selective influence.[10][11] Ford understood the significance of pleiotropism, and knew of Fisher's demonstration that a neutral gene derived from a single mutation could only be in about the same number of individuals as there had been generations since its inception.[12] Also, as Cain's own research showed, much polymorphism is maintained by differential selection in the diversity of environments within a species' range.[13][14][15]/nCain A.J. 1954.

Throughout his career, Sabatini has been recognized for his efforts in promoting science in Latin America.[3]/nSabatini is a native of Argentina, and attended medical school in Rosario at the National University of the Litoral. He began his research career at the University of Buenos Aires, in the laboratory of Eduardo De Robertis, a founder of modern cell biology, where he developed skills in electron microscopy. In 1961, as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, he traveled to the United States, first for a six-month stint at Yale University to work with histochemist Russell Barnett, and then to work with George Palade and Philip Siekevitz at the Rockefeller University. Whilst at Yale he introduced glutaraldehyde as a fixative for electron microscopy and cytochemistry.[4] After a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller, Sabatini entered the Rockefeller graduate program from which he received a PhD in 1966 for studies on protein translation by ribosomes attached to endoplasmic reticulum membranes.[5][6]/nSabatini's research has focused on the mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to different organelles within the cell. His early work studied co-translational targeting of ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and helped establish the hypothesis that signal peptides direct protein traffic to cellular compartments.[7] He later focused on trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to secretory vesicles and to the plasma membrane and in particular the mechanisms that address membrane proteins to the different surface domains of epithelial cells for which he employed viral infected epithelial monolayers.[8]/nAfter finishing his PhD, Sabatini joined the faculty at Rockefeller and in his own laboratory continued studies on protein trafficking in the ER. With a group of young associates (Nica Borgese, Mark Adelman, and Gert Kreibich), collaborating with Gunter Blobel, he continued research on the mechanism  that ensures the co-translational translocation and vectorial discharge of nascent polypeptides into and across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In in vitro experiments they discovered that the microsomal membrane protected the N-terminal portion of nascent polypeptides synthesized in membrane bound ribosomes from proteolytic attack by exogenous enzymes.[9][10][11][12] These studies strongly implicated the N-terminal portions of nascent polypeptides in establishing and maintaining the association of bound ribosomes with ER membranes./nLargely based on these findings, in 1971 Blobel and Sabatini proposed a speculative model[13] that later came to be known as the \"signal hypothesis\". For a discussion of the genesis and evolution of the signal hypothesis see LaBonte, 2017[14] In the 1971 paper, Blobel and Sabatini proposed that \u201call mRNAs to be translated on bound ribosomes have a common feature, such as several codons near their 5\u2019 end, not present in mRNAs which are to be translated on free ribosomes\u201d and that \u201cthe resulting common sequence of amino acids near the N-termini of the nascent chains, or a modification of it, would then be recognized by a factor mediating the binding to the membrane.\" They proposed that \"This binding factor could be a soluble protein, which recognizes both a site on the large ribosomal subunit and a site on the membrane.\u201d[15] A decade later, Walter and Blobel demonstrated the existence of a Signal Recognition Protein (SRP) that mediates the binding of the ribosome and the signal sequence within the nascent chain to the membrane.[16][17]  In 1982, a cognate receptor for the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) was discovered and characterized in the ER membrane.[18][19][20]/nIn 1972, Sabatini moved his laboratory to the New York University School of Medicine to become the chair of the Department of Cell Biology,[21] where he assembled a group that focused on the study of membrane and organelle biogenesis.[22] Initially, that work placed a primary emphasis on identifying structural features of secretory, lysosomal[23]  and integral membrane proteins[24]  that are synthesized on membrane bound ribosomes, address them to specific subcellular locations and determine their disposition within a membrane./nIn the late 1970s, in collaboration with Marcelino Cereijido[25] he introduced the now widely used MDCK cell culture system for the study of epithelial cell polarity and together with Enrique Rodriguez-Boulan reported the landmark discovery of the asymmetric budding of specific enveloped viruses from the different surfaces of epithelial cells.[26][27]/nSabatini was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980[28] and became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1985.[29]  In 1986, together with G\u00fcnter Blobel, he received the E.B.

He is an international specialist in the field of structural biology (crystallography) and has developed a software for modeling molecules using data from X rays or NMR, making France one of the very few countries to have developed software in the field of biological crystallography. His most innovative and spectacular work concerns the interactions between proteins and sugars (structural glycobiology) and the structural analysis of lipases (enzymes which hydrolyse fat). Thus, he was able to crystallize for the first time a lectin and glycoprotein complex, making it possible to carry out a precise three-dimensional analysis of interactions between proteins and complex sugars. He has also described the structural movements which can activate pancreatic lipase in the presence of its lipid substrate.

In 1920,  she discovered the effect now known as the 'Lee phenomenon' or 'Rosa Lee Phenomenon', and her results are still cited in modern publications./nLee was born in Conwy, Caernarvonshire in 1884. Her father, George Henry Payne Lee was a civil servant, born in Exeter, Devon. Her mother was Maria Agnes, born in St Pancras, London.  In 1894, her father worked in Conwy as a postal telegraph inspector. Rosa had two older brothers (Harold and Albert) and two older sisters (Amy and Florence).[1]/nShe graduated from Bangor University in 1904 with a BA in mathematics (Class: II), its first woman graduate in mathematics.[2]/nLee was employed by the Marine Biological Association (MBA) in their laboratory at Lowestoft, the first woman scientist to be employed by the MBA.[3] Lee became the first woman to work as a government fishery scientist[4] when she was employed as an assistant naturalist in 1905. In 1910, all of the staff at Lowestoft were transferred to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and during the original transfer, Lee was not offered a job. The board reportedly stated that they 'did not employ women scientists'.[5] However, after protests from the MBA and Garstang, she was allowed to start work as a civil servant. She continued her research and stayed on with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in London until 1919. She worked at the office in Delahay Street,[5] Westminster.[6]/nIn the 1911 census she was recorded as living in London with her sister, Amy Lee at 2 Avenue House, St Johns Wood, London.[7] The street is now renamed Allison Street but Avenue House still exists./nRosa Lee married Thomas Lewis Williams in 1917, but had to leave the Civil Service in 1919[5] as the marriage bar rules at the time did not allow married women to continue in employment [8]/nRosa and Thomas subsequently moved to Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, where Rosa stayed, until after her husband's death in 1946. Rosa herself died in Greenwich (London) in 1976, aged 92./nLee published a number of important scientific papers in her working life,[9][10] including an article that appeared in Nature in 1920.[11] However, her most cited work is not  one published in a prestigious journal, but is a report for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.[12]/nFish scales have growth rings and are used to age fish, in the same way that tree rings can be used to age trees. Fishery scientists try and understand the fish populations by modelling. They need to know how old and how big the fish are and how each \u2018cohort\u2019 of the population will grow as it matures. Each catch of fish has fish of different ages, i.e. fish that were born in different years. The size and growth of these fish can be linked to environmental variables. Predicting future stock of fish is necessary for good management, and to do this, accurate estimates of growth rates and 'length at age' are required.[13] By measuring the rings of a fish its possible to say how long it was for every year of its life./nLee observed that you may get different results for growth rates by 'back calculating' from an older fish, than you would when calculating growth rates from younger fish. This  phenomenon occurs when individuals in a population with slower growth rates suffer less mortality when young. The older population is skewed by more slower growing fish, as the faster growing fish died at a younger age. There can be a number of reasons for this, one reason can be selective mortality, e.g. fishing gear that selects for a particular size of fish will catch the larger young fish and the smaller old fish. It can also occur when the sampling is biased./nRosa Lee's work is still relevant today and her paper is frequently cited,[10] however her actual influence is greater than indicated by the number of citations, because some scientific authors simply refer to 'Rosa Lee's phenomenon' rather than correctly citing her publication.", "50325346": "Willa's Wild Life is a preschool animated television series based on Dan Yaccarino's book An Octopus Followed Me Home.

His initial research focused on echinoderm (primarily sea star and sea urchin) nutrition, and reproduction in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  In 1982 he made his first scientific visit into the Indian Ocean as a participant in the French Antarctic Research Program, working at a research base on the sub-Antarctic island of Kerguelen.  The following two years, as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow, McClintock continued his echinoderm studies in the waters of Antarctica's Southern Ocean at the United States research station McMurdo Station.[citation needed]/nSince 1989 McClintock has led or co-directed fourteen scientific expeditions with the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) in which he and his research collaborators have become authorities on Antarctic marine chemical ecology.[citation needed] This work, funded by NSF, has been conducted at the United States research facilities McMurdo Station (Ross Sea) and Palmer Station (Antarctic Peninsula). McClintock has published over 200 scientific publications, and co-edited and co-authored several books on marine invertebrates.  In 1998, the U.S. Geographic Board named McClintock Point on the north side of New Harbor, McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, in recognition of his contributions to Antarctic marine biology. In 1999 he was an elected Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science./nHis current work[when?], also funded by the NSF, focuses of the impacts of climate change along the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). This region of the planet is experiencing unprecedented warming.[5] Moreover, Antarctic seas are uniquely subject to the impacts of ocean acidification, the result of oceans absorbing anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Research projects are underway to examine how the combination of rising seawater temperatures and increased levels of ocean acidification may impact Antarctic marine plants and animals that have calcified body parts.  A separate NSF-funded research program co-directed by McClintock involves an investigation of large populations of king crabs currently invading Antarctic shelf waters[6]  as sea temperatures rise and their prospective impacts on seafloor communities./nMcClintock participates in educational outreach activities related to his work as an Antarctic marine ecologist.  He is an appointed member of the Advisory Board of the E.O.

She is professor emerita in the Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco. She is known for her pioneering work on the isolation of pluripotent stem cells from normal embryos, for which she coined the term \u2018embryonic stem cells\u2019.[1] She is also widely recognized for her work on the function of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) and their negative regulators in vertebrate organogenesis. She and her colleagues also made valuable contributions to gene targeting technology./nMartin grew up in The Bronx, New York, the only child of a pharmacist and a schoolteacher. She graduated from James Monroe High School in 1960, and earned her A.B. in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI in 1964. She then enrolled as a graduate student in the Department of Molecular Biology, University of California, Berkeley (UCB). It was a tumultuous time, because the student protest known as the Free Speech Movement took place in that academic year (1964\u201365), and Martin along with her fellow graduate students spent many hours in political discussion and activity. Martin did her doctoral work in Harry Rubin's laboratory, where she pursued several projects aimed at elucidating the mechanisms that control the growth of fibroblasts in vitro. She completed her Ph.D. thesis in 1971. It was during that time that she married Steven Martin, a British scientist who had come to Berkeley to do postdoctoral work in the Rubin laboratory./nAfter completing her graduate studies, Martin and her husband moved to London. In 1973, she worked with Martin J. Evans at University College London. Evans was then working with teratocarcinomas (a type of tumor), which are of interest because they contain pluripotent stem cells (known as embryonal carcinoma, [EC] cells) from which all the differentiated cell types in the tumor arise. During the two years she spent working in Evans' laboratory, Martin devised a protocol for isolating and maintaining EC cells in the undifferentiated state and for differentiating them in vitro. This work [2] laid the groundwork for the future isolation of pluripotent stem cells from normal mouse and human embryos. In 1976, Martin and her husband returned to Berkeley, where he took up a faculty position at UCB and she began a year of postdoctoral work with Charles J. Epstein in the Department of Pediatrics at UCSF. During this period she and her colleagues demonstrated that female EC cells had two active X chromosomes and could be used to study X-chromosome inactivation in vitro.[3]/nIn 1976 Martin joined the UCSF faculty and established her own laboratory, which was active until 2012. Her first major accomplishment was the isolation of pluripotent stem cells from normal mouse blastocysts.[1] This was also achieved by Evans and Kaufman [4]  in the same year. Subsequently, using sophisticated genetic methods that she helped to pioneer, Martin and her colleagues demonstrated the importance of FGF signaling in the development of many organs including the limb. Martin's laboratory also took the lead in studying the role of negative feedback mechanisms for regulating FGF signaling in the mammalian embryo These studies have led to an appreciation of the exquisite sensitivity of developmental and cell biological processes to even small changes in the level of FGF signaling./nDuring her tenure at UCSF, Martin served as director of the Graduate Program in Developmental Biology (1986-2009). She also was responsible, in collaboration with a software engineer, Jonathan Scoles, for the development of a database that provides a description of all the genetically altered mice housed at UCSF. This online resource helps researchers determine if mice carrying a particular genetic alteration are available at UCSF and to find out whom to contact about the possibility of obtaining them. Access to this information has saved investigators considerable time and money in acquiring mouse models for their studies and been a stimulus to collaboration between researchers./nMartin has received numerous awards including an American Cancer Society Faculty Research Award (1979\u201383), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1991\u201392), the Edwin Grant Conklin Medal from the Society for Developmental Biology (2002),[5] the  Pearl Meister Greengard Prize (Rockefeller University), co-recipients: Beatrice Mintz and Elizabeth Robertson (2007), and the, FASEB Excellence in Science Award (2011)./nShe received an honorary Doctorate of Science (DSc [Med]) from University College London (2011).

In Ghana, he established public health initiatives for SCD screening in newborns, as well as an SCD clinic for patients with the disease./nOhene-Frempong was born on 13 March 1946 in Kukurantumi, Eastern Region, Gold Coast (now Ghana) to Kwasi Adde Ohene, a cocoa farmer, and Adwoa Odi Boafo.[1] Because Kukurantumi lacked education above the middle school level, he completed Ordinary and Advanced-level secondary school studies at Prempeh College in Kumasi, Ashanti Region, where he was also a Senior Prefect.[1][4] While at Prempeh, he was a senior high school national champion in several track and field events, including the hurdles, long jump and high jump.[5]/nAfter graduating from Prempeh, Ohene-Frempong was one of 16 Ghanaian students to receive a scholarship from the United States Agency for International Development-supported African Scholarship Program of American Universities, which he used to attend Yale University for his undergraduate studies.[6] He graduated with a B.S. in biology in 1970.[7] While at Yale, he was a standout athlete on the track-and-field and soccer teams, on which he competed for four and three years respectively.[7] Ohene-Frempong was invited to compete on the Ghanaian national team at the 1968 Olympics, and although he initially planned to take a leave of absence for one semester to participate, he opted to focus on his studies instead.[6] In his senior year, Ohene Frempong was Captain of the indoor (1969\u201370) and the outdoor (1970) track teams.[7] That year, in the outdoor Ivy League track and field championships, he won first place in the 120-yard hurdles (110 metres hurdles) in 13.9 seconds, setting a Yale record as well as a Ghanaian national record that lasted until the 1996 Olympic games.[4][6] He also won the 60-yard high hurdles in 7.10 seconds, setting a conference championship record.[6] At his graduation, he was awarded the William Neely Mallory Award, given to Yale's \"outstanding senior male student-athlete\".[7] Later that year, in July 1970, Ohene-Frempong represented Ghana at the men's 110 metres hurdles at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games, placing seventh with a time of 14.7 seconds.[8]/nOhene-Frempong attended Yale School of Medicine, earning his M.D. degree in 1975.[7] During medical school, he spent some of his training at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi in 1974.[4] As part of his M.D. requirements, he completed a thesis entitled \"Child Health in a Ghanaian Community\", based on some of his work at KATH.[6] He completed his residency in Pediatrics at New York Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City, followed by a fellowship in Pediatric Hematology-Oncology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).[7]/nOhene-Frempong became an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1980.[9] In his position there, he founded the Tulane Sickle Cell Center of Southern Louisiana and served as Medical Director there.[4] He was also involved with the Louisiana Department of Health in starting a newborn screening program for SCD for infants in the state.[1] Six years later, in 1986, Ohene-Frempong returned to Philadelphia, moving back to CHOP where he had completed his fellowship, with an academic appointment as Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. At CHOP, he established the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center,[9] with funding awarded by the National Institutes of Health in 1988, and he became director in 1990.[4] As part of his work with the Center, Ohene-Frempong led the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD),[1] a multicenter study with the purpose of \"[determining] the natural history of sickle cell disease from birth to death in order to identify those factors contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the disease.\"[10] The study found that a leading cause of pediatric mortality in SCD was cerebrovascular clots, causing strokes in children. Subsequent studies identified patients sub-groups at high risk of cerebrovascular complications in SCD, and that interventions such as blood transfusions could prevent these complications and decrease mortality in children with SCD.[1] In 1997, he subsequently achieved promotion to full professorship, and retired from CHOP and became an emeritus professor in 2011.[9]/nDespite being based in the United States, Ohene-Frempong continued his involvement in SCD care in Ghana, returning to KTAH to help establish a SCD clinic there in December 1992. In 1993, he receiving a grant from the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for a SCD newborn screening pilot project in Ghana centered in Kumasi and the town of Tikrom, on Kumasi's outskirts; this was the first screening program for SCD in Africa. In its subsequent 10 years, 158,000 infants were tested for SCD in the region, with 2,400 out of 3,000 newborns connected to the SCD clinic at KTAH due to the screening program itself.[4] After retiring from CHOP, Ohene-Frempong began working full-time at the Kumasi Center for Sickle Cell Disease.[9] While in Ghana, he founded and served as president of the Sickle Cell Foundation of Ghana,[1] and was also the in-country coordinator for the Consortium on Newborn Screening in Africa, which was established by the American Society of Hematology in 2018.[9] Internationally, he was one of the founders of the Global Sickle Cell Disease Network, and helped organize the organization's First Global Congress on Sickle Cell Disease in July 2010, marking a century since SCD had been first published about in medical literature.[11]/nIn 2010, he was awarded the Order of the Volta, awarded for outstanding service to the country of Ghana. In 2015, he received the Millennium Excellence Award in Medicine. In 2020, he received the Assistant Secretary of Health Exceptional Service Medal. In 2021, he received the Stratton Award for Translational and Clinical Science from The American Society for Hematology.[1]/nOhene-Frempong also received several awards for his accomplishments in athletics. In 1999, he was inducted into the International Scholar Athlete Hall of Fame in its first year of existence, as well as an NCAA Silver Anniversary Award in 2000.[7]/nOhene-Frempong married Janet Williams on 6 June 1970. Together they had two children, Kwami and Afia. Their son Kwame, who was born in 1972 while Ohene-Frempong was a medical student at Yale, was born with SCD. The diagnosis, as well as the realization during medical school that other family members had previously undiagnosed SCD, inspired Ohene-Frempong to make the disease the focus of his professional career.[6] Kwame died due to complications of the disease in 2013.[1]/nOhene-Frempong died on 7 May 2022 of metastatic lung cancer.[1]", "70608781": "Linda Zimmerman Holland is a research biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography known for her work examining the evolution of vertebrates./nHolland has a B.A. (1962) and an M.A. (1964) from Stanford University.

He is a Bing Professor in environmental science at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.[1] His research interests mainly focus on plant-animal interactions, evolutionary ecology, and defaunation in the tropics of Latin America, Africa, and the Central Pacific.[2] He was a member of the Committee on A Conceptual Framework for New K-12 Science Education Standards, co-authoring the framework in 2012, and continues to educate local communities and young people about science and environmental issues.[1][3]/nDirzo was born in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.[4] He received his Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) in 1972, where he did thesis work on vegetation mapping of a watershed north of Mexico City.[5] After receiving his bachelor's degree, Dirzo worked in the lab of Professor Jos\u00e9 Sarukh\u00e1n, a renowned tropical ecologist, at UNAM for a few years.[5] As a research assistant for Dr. Sarukh\u00e1n, Dirzo worked on a long-term tree demography study collecting data on tree characteristics over time to eventually determine how humans impacted tree population dynamics.[4] He obtained his MS and PhD degrees, both in Ecology and both under prominent plant ecologist John Harper, from the University of Wales, UK in 1977 and 1980, respectively. Inspired by Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species and his mentors, Sarukh\u00e1n and Harper, Dirzo decided to focus his graduate work on how animals influence plant ecology and evolution, and more specifically on the evolution of anti-herbivore defenses in plants.[4] His master's thesis and dissertation examined how the white clover (Trifolium repens) may have developed increased cyanogenic properties as an adaptation to herbivory by slugs.[3]/nThroughout his career, Dirzo has held many professional appointments, serving as a professor, director, chairperson, and coordinator for multiple institutions. In 1983, he became a professor with the Instituto de Biolog\u00eda at the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station in Veracruz, Mexico. He was later appointed director of Los Tuxtlas in the mid-1980s and began researching patterns of herbivory in the area.[5] After his time at Los Tuxtlas, Dirzo returned to UNAM as a professor with the Instituto de Ecolog\u00eda, where he taught for 16 years. Dirzo currently teaches ecology, natural history, and conservation science in the Biology Department at Stanford University, where he has been an instructor since 2005.[1] While at Stanford, he also served as director for the Center for Latin American Studies (2010-2016) and co-director of the INOGO Program of the Woods Institute for the Environment (2011-2017).[1]/nAfter finishing his graduate programs, Dirzo went back to Mexico, where he hoped to determine if the same concepts he examined in his graduate work could explain plant-animal interactions in tropical ecosystems.[5] As director of the Los Tuxtlas Biological Station, he began analyzing amounts of herbivory in the region and found no evidence of mammalian herbivory. This led him to believe mammalian herbivores were relatively unimportant for tropical forests.[5] In 1992, Dirzo received a Marine Fellowship from the PEW Fellows Program in Conservation and the Environment, which he used to develop a research laboratory at the Chajul Field Station in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, Mexico.[6] He used this reserve and research station to continue his work on herbivory patterns. He found that in Montes Azules, where human encroachment was not impacting the area as it was in Los Tuxtlas, there were blatant signs of mammalian herbivory.[3] His research in these areas led him to understand that, contrary to his hypothesis, mammals were important to tropical ecosystems, and that Los Tuxtlas was experiencing defaunation (loss of fauna), most likely due to anthropogenic causes.[5] Dirzo pioneered the study on the impacts of humans on defaunation and illuminated the importance of ecosystem services provided by mammalian herbivores to lower trophic levels (i.e. plants) in the tropical ecosystem./nIn more recent years, Dirzo has carried his research on to other parts of the world, researching how defaunation is impacting these regions, as well. In the African savanna, Dirzo studied how defaunation leads to an increase in the population of rodents due to loss of medium and large vertebrates that either directly prey on rodents or consume rodent habitat (i.e. grass).[4]\u00a0 Since rodents are known disease reservoirs, one major consequence of this is an increase in disease transmission, especially since defaunation usually occurs in highly populated areas (however, he also finds that effects of defaunation can vary based on secondary land use employed).[7] Currently, Dirzo is \u201cconducting a review analysis to assess the consistency of differential defaunation across the globe\u201d.[4] Additionally, he is working with Mexico's national commission for biodiversity (CONABIO) on a countrywide evaluation of biodiversity across Mexican ecosystems, while also looking at how defaunation may be increasing animal-to-human disease transmission (AKA zoonosis) in Mexico.[4]/nBesides teaching and conducting research, Dirzo also works to educate young people and local communities about science and the environment. In the San Francisco Bay Area, he is involved with projects that target minorities and underprivileged groups, such as the Redwood Academy of Leadership (REAL), Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for Latina Girls, and Stanford Science for the East Palo Alto Academy.[4] These programs aim to give children and young adults the chance to participate in hands-on science education, observe how science professionals operate, and possibly inspire their future careers.[8] When visiting his field sites in other countries, he also seeks to teach the local communities, especially children, about the importance of the region's biodiversity and environmental stewardship.[4]/nDirzo has been recognized for his contributions to the ecological, academic, and conservation fields in the United States and Mexico.

He studied medicine at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, graduating in 1931. Deciding for a career in experimental biological research, Lison started to work in histology, developing a number of new techniques for dyeing specific substances present in a slice of tissue. Before the advent of radiolabeling, this was the only group of techniques which could infer function based on biochemical activity and it represented a great promise not only for basic science, such as physiology and pharmacology, but for pathology and laboratory diagnosis of diseases, as well. He developed the Lison-Dunn stain, a technique using leuco patent blue V and hydrogen peroxidase to demonstrate hemoglobin peroxidase in tissues and smears. In 1936, Lison wrote a landmark paper, where he stated precisely the scientifically acceptable criteria to develop techniques of morphological evidence of cytochemical processes./nIn 1950, together with J. Pasteels, he developed a new histophotometer and a technique which he used extensively to quantify DNA content in several types of cells, present in chromatin (chromosomes in the nucleolus). This approach became a widely used laboratory tool in the beginning of the new science of molecular biology and genetics./nIn 1951, using this technique with the Feulgen reaction, both authors studied the amount of DNA in the nuclei of developing sea urchin eggs and showed for the first time the important fact that each time that morphogenesis is accompanied by an intense mitosis, the amount of nuclear DNA is increased in this region./nLison also contributed extensively to the understanding of metachromasy, the histochemistry of phosphatases and of lipids. In 1952, Lison published a truly monumental textbook on animal histochemistry, which became a classic in the field, unifying and integrating many concepts. With this, he was hailed as the \"father of histochemistry\"./nIn 1953 he was invited by Prof. Zeferino Vaz, the founder and director of the Medical School of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, in the campus of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, to chair the Department of Histology. Europe was living through the difficult post-war years and the concept proposed by Vaz was revolutionary and intrinsically motivational for Lison and other Europeans who had accepted similar invitations. After a year of work, the Department of Anatomy of the new institution was merged with the Department of Histology, under the single denomination of Department of Morphology, under Lison's leadership. Dr. Lison became a full professor and chairman with the thesis titled \"Influence of Fixative Agents on the Histochemical Reaction of Amine Groups\", a very important work for neurochemistry. In 1960, he published a textbook, \"Animal Histochemistry and Citochemistry, Principles and Methods\", an expansion and update on his first book./nLison had a very active and eclectical mind, as well as a legendary memory. He also wrote a text on biostatistics in 1958, and 10 years later, he started also to experiment with new approaches to medical education and educational technology.[2] In 1964 he created and was the first director of a new school in the campus of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters, which began with baccalaureate courses in biology and psychology.

She also assisted Professor Li Sizhong in conducting a review of the distribution of the important Chinese carp species. It was during her time at the Chinese Academy of Sciences that she first travelled to Sweden, working for three months from October 1992 as a visiting scientist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History under a scholarship supported by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Science. During this stay she mainly worked on the sorting and identification of the collection of freshwater fish from Sri Lanka, most of which actually came from the Museum of Zoology at Lund University.[1]/nThis work led Fang Fang to submit a proposal to carry out a Ph.D. revising the cyprinid genus Danio at the Department of Zoology at Stockholm University, which was accepted in 1993.

Born in New Zealand, she earned a doctorate at the University of California at San Diego and later completed law school at the University of Texas at Austin. After retirement from her law career, Rae-Venter started researching her family history as a hobby in an attempt to help a family member find his biological family.  As part of this work, she was asked to help identify a woman who had been abducted as a child. Her efforts in this case eventually identified Terry Peder Rasmussen as the suspect in the Bear Brook murders in New Hampshire. In 2019 she was included in the Time 100 list of most influential people and in 2018 was recognized in Nature's 10, a list of \"people who mattered\" in science by the journal Nature. Barbara authored the book I Know Who You Are: How an amatueur DNA sleuth unmasked the Golden State Killer and changed crime fighting forever in 2023./nBarbara Rae was born on July 17, 1948, in Auckland, New Zealand,[1] and raised in Auckland's Remuera neighborhood.[2] She moved to the United States at age 20,[2] and has United States citizenship.[1] She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and biochemistry from the University of California at San Diego in 1972, and received her Ph.D. in biology at the same institution in 1976.  From 1976 to 1979 she was a postdoctoral fellow at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (then known as the Roswell Park Memorial Institute) in Buffalo, New York. From 1979 to 1983 she was assistant professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. Rae-Venter focused her research career on breast and gastrointestinal cancer.[3]/nShe matriculated at the University of Texas at Austin Law School in May 1983 and received her J.D. in August 1985.[1] She later worked as a patent lawyer in California specializing in biotechnology[4] and was an assistant professor at Stanford University from 1988 to 1990.[1][5]/nThe field of genetic genealogy was developed largely by volunteer family history hobbyists, and Rae-Venter realized that the techniques used to identify family members in adoption cases could have wider uses in law enforcement and the identification of suspects and victims of crime. Some law enforcement agencies were initially dismissive of the idea.[6]/nRae-Venter's interest in genealogy began when she found a relative through a website for sharing family trees who was looking to identify his biological father.[4] In order to help her relative search for his father, she completed an online course on how to use genetic testing to find relatives, eventually becoming one of the course's teachers.[4][7]/nRae-Venter has been involved in solving several high-profile criminal cases, including the Bear Brook murders in New Hampshire and the Golden State Killer in California. In 2018, after her role in using genetics and genealogy to solve crimes became well-known, Rae-Venter was named in Nature's list of \"10 People who Mattered this Year\".[8] She was recognized in the 2019 Time 100 list of most influential people.[9]/nRae-Venter's initial involvement with using publicly-available genetic databases and family trees to contribute to criminal investigations started in 2015, when she was asked to assist investigators in identifying the true identity of a woman who had been kidnapped as an infant.[4] In addition to searching for family members whose DNA matched the woman's genetic profile on publicly available websites, Rae-Venter suggested the woman submit her sample to closed databases in the hopes of finding more family members.[10] The case evolved to require 20,000 hours of work and a significant number of volunteers who were able to identify the woman's birth name and to put her in contact with one of her grandfathers.[4]/nIn addition to identifying the woman's family and birth name, Rae-Venter and her team identified the birth mother of a relative found during the search, which allowed them to meet.[11] The identification of this woman led authorities to link her kidnapper to a series of murders in New Hampshire, known as the Bear Brook murders.[10] Rae-Venter contributed to the eventual identification of the suspect's true identity, Terry Peder Rasmussen, using DNA obtained from his autopsy after his death in prison. Rasmussen had been imprisoned for another murder under the name Larry Vanner.[12] In 2019, three of the victims of the Bear Brook murders were identified as 24 year-old Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, and her daughters, Marie Elizabeth Vaughn (6 years old) and Sarah Lynn McWaters (1 year old).[13]/nPaul Holes, an inspector who had been working on the Golden State Killer case for decades, initially contacted Rae-Venter in March 2017 for her assistance in using genealogy to search for new leads in the case. In October 2017, Rae-Venter was contributing to the team attempting to identify the killer. Rae-Venter utilized GEDmatch, Family Tree DNA, and MyHeritage and provided structure to the team's genetic search efforts.[12] The team isolated a DNA sample from a Golden State Killer crime scene to create a DNA profile that could be uploaded to the genealogy databases, which produced positive matches to several distant relatives, and from these Rae-Venter was able to build a family tree using traditional family research techniques. By identifying relatives of the killer, investigators could first work back to find a common ancestor, and then work forward to identify all members of the family's younger generations. Once all the members of a family had been identified, investigators could then start eliminating individuals who were not suspects. In the case of the Golden State Killer, the team needed to go back to great-great-great grandparents before starting to work forward.[12] Multiple family trees needed to be constructed.[3] This information was combined with predictions about ethnicity and physical appearance to narrow down the suspect list.[12] Multiple pieces of evidence started to converge when the genetic profiles were considered, including the possibility that the suspect had Italian heritage.[3] After the suspect had been identified, new DNA samples were collected from the suspect surreptitiously and tested against crime scene samples. The suspect's samples matched those from the killer, confirming his identity. Joseph DeAngelo was arrested on April 24, 2018.[14]/nIn the immediate aftermath of the arrest, Rae-Venter chose not to be publicly identified, out of fears for her personal safety.[4]  Several months after the arrest of the Golden State Killer, Rae-Venter allowed Holes to identify her publicly.  The intervening months had seen increased interest in genetic genealogy, and additional people had been identified in the field.[4]  After her role in the Golden State Killer case became well-known, Rae-Venter was approached to assist in at least 50 unsolved cases, including homicides and unidentified victims.[15]/nAs one of the first public faces of genetic genealogy in law enforcement in the United States, Rae-Venter has been asked to consult on additional cases, and also to comment on the ethics of using shared community data for law enforcement purposes.  She has also been one of the most sought after voices when ethical questions arise about the use of shared genetic data by law enforcement.  At the conclusion of the Golden State Killer case, Rae-Venter discussed future cases that she was working on, including the \"Boy in the Box\" case in Pennsylvania.[12]/nIn 2019, Rae-Venter helped identify Bobby Whitt, a boy who had been found in Mebane, North Carolina in 1998.  Based on the DNA profile of the child, she determined that the child was likely of mixed Asian and white descent.  Searches of online databases identified a possible relative, who could identify the child.  Whitt's family had assumed he had returned to South Korea with his mother.  This discovery also resulted in the identification of his mother's remains.  A suspect, who was already incarcerated on other charges was identified.[16]/nIn the late 1960s, while in Sydney, Australia, she met J. Craig Venter, an American soldier on leave from the Vietnam War. They reunited while she was on a three-month hiking tour of Europe, and they were married in Geneva in 1968. They separated in 1980, and have one child.[17] She married Joseph Elmer Huff III on September 21, 1981, divorcing in April 1983.  Later in his career, Venter became involved in the Human Genome Project, sequencing the first copy of the human genome.[18] In the course of her research into her own family tree, Rae-Venter identified a great uncle who worked as a police officer in London during the time Jack the Ripper was active.[8]", "47769565": "Shobhona Sharma (born 5 February 1953) is a professor specializing in immunology, molecular biology, and biochemistry at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.

He is also a current editor for several academic journals, such as PLoS Biology, EMBOReports and Journal of Biological Rhythms./nUeli Schibler was born in 1947 in Olten, a small town in Switzerland. His father was a sculptor who manufactured monuments, and his mother helped manage the family business. In 1972, Ueli Schibler married with Monika Schibler, who he met at the age of 19, and had a son and daughter. His son was born in Philadelphia in 1977 when Ueli was a postdoc at Fox Chase Cancer Center while his daughter was born in 1979, one year after they moved back to Switzerland. Currently, Ueli Schibler resides in Switzerland and works in University of Geneva as a professor at the Department of Molecular Biology. Monika and Ueli Schibler are now grandparents and have three grandchildren./nOver 5 years from 1967 to 1972, Schibler pursued the study of biology, biochemistry, and chemistry at the University of Bern, approximately seventy kilometers from his hometown of Olten. At graduation, he was awarded a Diploma in Biology. Afterwards, he continued his education there, eventually receiving his PhD diploma with Latin Honors in 1975 for his work on ribosomal RNA in the context of vertebrate evolution.[2] He then obtained a postdoctoral fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation and worked at the laboratory of Robert Perry, who was based at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia for two years. In 1978, he became a junior group leader at The Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research. In 1981, he was promoted to the status of a group leader with tenure, where he remained for three years. Finally, in 1984, he obtained a full professorship at the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva, where he currently resides.[4]/nSchibler was thrust into the world of chronobiology on a single chance discovery. While examining transcription of serum albumin gene in the liver, they discovered a DNA Binding Protein (DBP) for the albumin promoter that happened to be rhythmic in its expression. While they initially thought that the underlying mechanism was the rhythmic secretion of hormones, it became clear that the rhythmic expression of DBP was driven instead by cell-autonomous oscillators that are entrained by the master clock in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). Schibler and his colleagues followed this line of inquiry into the field of chronobiology.\n[5]/nA timing system with circadian clocks is closely related to all behaviors in mammals. Schibler is currently doing researches on how biological clock works. Schibler together with his research team in University of Geneva have developed a technique called \"Synthetic Tandem Repeat PROMoter (STAR-PROM) screening\" which can assist identify transcription factors and their functions in peripheral cells so that to figure out how circadian gene expression is governed rhythmically with regulatory mechanisms in cultured cells.[6]/nWhile at the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva, Schibler's research team unexpectedly came across DBP, a transcriptional regulatory protein whose expression was found to be robustly circadian in the liver. This discovery prompted Schibler and his team to further investigate the role of circadian clocks in peripheral tissue.[2]/nIn a 1998 study, Schibler and his team published a paper providing strong evidence for the existence of circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral tissue.[3] The study demonstrated that \"immortalized rat fibroblasts\", frozen in cell culture for 25 years, were still capable of expressing strong circadian rhythms. After an initial serum-shock, both rat-1 fibroblasts and H35 hepatoma cells demonstrated cyclic mRNA expression of clock genes rper1 and rper2, and Rev-Erb\u03b1, and the clock controlled genes Tef and Dbp, with a period of nearly 24 hours and a phase relationship closely mimicking those observed in rat liver cells in vivo.[7]/nIn a 2004 study that provided further evidence for the existence of self-sustained, autonomous oscillators in the peripheral tissue,[8] Schibler and his colleagues found evidence for interaction between the circadian clock and the timing of cell division. Single-cell recordings revealed how circadian gene expression in fibroblasts persists during cell division, and how cell division can phase shift the circadian cycle of the dividing cells.[9] Due to the central role of Period (PER) and Cryptochrome (CRY) proteins in the negative feedback loop of the circadian clock, Schibler and colleagues posited the PER-CRY complex concentration to be the likely determinant of the phase of the clock.[10] When cell division frequency was plotted against circadian time, this yielded a highly nonrandom distribution, suggesting a gating mechanism of mitosis by the circadian clock[9]/nSchibler and his colleagues have also studied mechanisms by which peripheral oscillators are synchronized within the body. In 2000, they conducted experiments on the effects of restricted feeding time on mice and observed that the phase of peripheral oscillators \u2013 but not that of the SCN \u2013 gradually adapted to imposed feeding-fasting rhythms within a week or two.[11] These results showed that feeding time functions as a potent Zeitgeber for peripheral cells, but not for the SCN. Schibler and colleagues posited that the SCN can synchronize peripheral clocks simply by imposing rest-activity cycles, which in turn drive feeding-fasting cycles. However, in the meantime they discovered additional pathways involved in the phase-resetting of peripheral clocks, such as signaling by glucocorticoid hormones,[12] body temperature,[13] and actin dynamics.[14]/nIn 2002, Schibler and his colleagues identified the nuclear orphan receptor REV-ERB\u03b1 as the major regulator of expression of the circadian gene Bmal1 in both the SCN and peripheral tissues. BMAL-1, as a heterodimer with CLOCK activates the transcription of the components of the negative limb encoding PER and CRY repressor proteins. Together, the feedback loop of the positive limb and its effects on the negative limb produce the mammalian circadian rhythms in clock gene expression. REV-ERB\u03b1 and its paralog REV-ERB\u03b2 are the molecular links between these two feedback loops.[15][16]", "39020545": "Nenad Ban is a biochemist born in Zagreb, Croatia who currently works at the ETH Zurich, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, as a professor of Structural Molecular Biology.

He invented the term sympatric for evolution of species in the same place, and in his book The Colours of Animals (1890) was the first to recognise frequency-dependent selection. Poulton is also remembered for his pioneering work on animal coloration. He is credited with inventing the term aposematism for warning coloration, as well as for his experiments on 'protective coloration' (camouflage). Poulton became Hope Professor of Zoology at the University of Oxford in 1893.[2]/nEdward Poulton was born in Reading, Berkshire on 27 January 1856 the son of the architect William Ford Poulton and his wife, Georgina Sabrina Bagnall. He was educated at Oakley House School in Reading.[3]/nBetween 1873 and 1876, Poulton studied at Jesus College, Oxford under George Rolleston and the anti-Darwinian entomologist John Obadiah Westwood, graduating with a first-class degree in natural science.[4] He maintained an unbroken connection with the college for seventy years as scholar, lecturer and Fellow (appointed to a fellowship in 1898) until his death. He was a generous benefactor to Jesus College, providing silver for the high table and redecorating the Old Bursary amongst other donations.[5]/nHe was knighted by King George V in 1935. Poulton died in Oxford on 20 November 1943./nPoulton was throughout his career a Darwinist, believing in natural selection as the primary force in evolution. He not only admired Charles Darwin, but also defended the father of neo-Darwinism, August Weismann. Poulton was one of the group of biologists who first translated Weismann's work into English, and he defended Weismann's idea of the continuity of the germ-plasm. In the course of these translations, he noted that recent researches had reduced or perhaps entirely removed the role of acquired characters (Lamarckism) in species formation./nHis 1890 book, The Colours of Animals, introduced the concepts of frequency-dependent selection and aposematic coloration, as well as supporting Darwin's then unpopular theories of natural selection and sexual selection.[6] He conducted a range of experiments on the colours of polymorphic caterpillars to examine if food, background or other factors are involved in their colour changes. He was able to show that the caterpillars were sensitive to the background colours and that it was perceived even when they were blinded, and was among the earliest to suggest extraocular photoreception.[7]/nPoulton enlarged the Hope entomological collections with his catches in the field which earned him the nickname of \"Bag-all\" Poulton. Many of the specimens are unmounted and held in biscuit tins (possibly acquired through Huntley & Palmer biscuits owned by his wife's family).[8]/nIn his 1896 book Charles Darwin and the Theory of Natural Selection,[9] Poulton described the Origin of Species as \"incomparably the greatest work\" the biological sciences had seen. Critics of natural selection, Poulton contended, had not taken the time to understand it. This is an evaluation which is much more widely held today than it was then, during the so-called eclipse of Darwinism. The contemporary ignorance of the mechanism of inheritance stood in the way of a full understanding of the mechanism of evolution./nIn 1897 Poulton canvassed members during meetings of the Entomological Society of London. He discovered that many doubted a selectionist origin for mimicry. Of those he asked, only three fully supported Batesian mimicry and M\u00fcllerian mimicry. The others doubted the inedibility/unpalatability of the models (some investigators even performed taste tests!) or were not convinced that birds were effective selective agents. External and internal forces remained popular alternatives to natural selection./nThe rediscovery of Mendel's work filled a critical gap in evolution theory, but at first this was not realised, and many thought it antithetical to selection.[10][page\u00a0needed] There was a long debate between Poulton and Reginald Punnett, one of Bateson's disciples and the first Professor of Genetics at Oxford. Punnett's Mimicry in butterflies (1915) rejected selection as the main cause of mimicry. He noted:/nFor Punnett, none of these observations were explained by gradual selectionism. Instead he thought mimicry had arisen from sudden mutational jumps (saltations). Once a mimic was formed by mutation, natural selection might play a conservative role./nHowever, one by one, each of these objections was shown to be without substance. Evidence from field observations and experiments showed that birds were often the agents of selection in insects.[11][page\u00a0needed][12][page\u00a0needed][13][page\u00a0needed] Evidence that small-scale mutations were common arrived as soon as breeding experiments were designed to detect them: it was a consequence of experimental methods that early mutations were so noteworthy. Explanations for polymorphism were advanced by E.B. Ford, Theodosius Dobzhansky and their colleagues, who developed experimental methods for populations in the wild.[14][page\u00a0needed][15][page\u00a0needed]/nThe gradual coming-together of field observations and experimental genetics is part of the modern synthesis which took place in the middle of the twentieth century.[16] As has become widely accepted, mutations increase the amount of heritable variation in a population, and selection is how biologists describe the differential viability of those variants.[17] Poulton's account is much closer to a modern view of evolution, though Punnett had framed important questions.[18][19]/nPoulton's Presidential Address to the British Association in 1937 at the age of 81 reviewed the history of evolutionary thought. He stated that the work of J.B.S. Haldane, R.A. Fisher and Julian Huxley was vitally important for showing the relationships between Mendelism and natural selection. The observations and experiments of many biologists had \"immensely strengthened and confirmed\" the researches on mimicry and warning colours of pioneers like Bates, Wallace, Meldola, Trimen and M\u00fcller.[20]/nPoulton lived with his family at 56 Banbury Road in North Oxford, a large Victorian Gothic house designed by John Gibbs and built in 1866.[21]/nIn 1881 he married Emily Palmer (d.1939), daughter of George Palmer, M.P. for Reading and head of Huntley and Palmer's biscuit company; they had five children. Three of them were dead by 1919.

Poulton's son, Ronald Poulton-Palmer played international rugby for England and was killed in May 1915 in World War I. His first daughter Hilda married Dr Ernest Ainsley-Walker and died in 1917.

He is known as one of the pioneers of understanding and reconstructing the enzymatic processes involved in bacterial metabolic processes.[1]/nAfter completing secondary school in Fort Wayne, he briefly worked for a railroad company. He then matriculated at Purdue University, where he graduated in 1919 with a B.S. in chemistry. In 1919, for a few months, he did routine research for the Food and Drug Administration in the Department of Agriculture. In September 1919 he became a chemistry instructor at the University of Idaho. In September 1920 he became a graduate student in the bacteriology department of Iowa State University. There in 1923 he received his doctorate with dissertation Immunologic Significance of Vitamins under the supervision of Robert Earle Buchanan.[1] For the academic year 1924\u20131925 Werkman was an assistant professor in microbiology at the University of Massachusetts. At Iowa State University, he was from 1925 to 1927 an assistant professor, from 1927 to 1933 an associate professor, and from 1933 to retirement a full professor. From 1945[2] until retirement, he was the head of the bacteriology department, but a number of his colleagues considered his control of the department \"petty and autocratic\".[3]/nInfluenced by Albert Jan Kluyver, Werkman directed Iowa State's microbiological department toward biochemical methods, which before Werkman's influence was somewhat more oriented toward botany and zoology. In his laboratory he worked with several noteworthy researchers over the years, including Lester O. Krampitz and Merton F. Utter (both of whom were his doctoral students). Working with Harland G. Wood in 1936 led to an outstanding result, when it was discovered that some bacteria (of the genus Propionibacterium) can utilize CO2 as chemotrophs. Wood and Werkman's work followed pioneering research by Cornelis Bernardus van Niel in Kluyver's laboratory.[1][4]/nIn 1944 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Purdue University. In 1946 he was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[1]/nHe married Cecile Baker in 1913.[2] Their son Robert Theodore Werkman (1915\u20132012) became a chemical engineer and a U.S. Army captain, who participated in the Battle of the Bulge.", "53078067": "Angelika Barbe (n\u00e9e Mangoldt, 26 November 1951) is a German biologist who became a politician.[1]/nDuring the changes in the later 1980s, which led to a restoration of democracy in East Germany and German reunification just over six months later, she played a leading role in the opposition movement, and was a co-founder of the relaunched (in East Germany) Social Democratic party.[2] Following reunification she served as a member of the national parliament (Bundestag) between 1990 and 1994.[3] She has been identified with a certain \"moral rigour\" which was on display in 1996 when she switched her political allegiance from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to the CDU (centre-right party) because she found her SPD party colleagues unnecessarily accommodating with the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) (which was at that stage a partially re-invented successor to what had been the ruling party in the old East German one-party dictatorship).[4]/nAngelika Mangoldt was born in Brandenburg an der Havel, a small town then in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), near Berlin. Her father was a freelance landscape gardener who later worked as a builder in a cooperative.[2] She attended school at Schenkenberg and, between 1966 and 1970, at Jeserig nearby. After this she attended a pre-university school (\"Erweiterte Oberschule\") at Ziesar.[2] In order to progress to higher education it was necessary to pass her school leaving exams (\"Abitur\"). She encountered major difficulties in obtaining permission to sit the exam because by this time her parents were listed by the authorities as \"negative and hostile\" (\"feindlich negativ\") because they made a point of boycotting the country's phony elections (in which, officially, more than 99% of those entitled to vote always participated and more than 99% of those voting backed the single list of candidates put forward by the ruling party).[3] Nevertheless, in the context of East Germany's acute shortage of skilled labour, she took her Abitur, passing a semi-vocational exam designed for skilled manual workers (\"Betriebsschlosser\"), with a \"distinction\" citation in 1970. She was able to pass the exam in this way without compromising her political independence.[3]/nShe studied Biology at Berlin's Humboldt University between 1970 and 1974, with a particular focus on behavioural aspects.[1] Between 1974 and 1979 she worked for a year in \"plant preservation\" in Potsdam, and then as a biologist with the Hygiene Inspectorate in Berlin's Lichtenberg quarter.[1] Around this time she got married. While bringing up her (three) small children she continued to study behavioural biology in spare moments.[1] She also joined the local (Protestant) church council and over time began to take a closer interest in potentially political issues such as environmental concerns, human rights and pacifism.[3] It was through her church connections that she came across the Pankow Peace Circle, which had been established by Ruth Misselwitz\u00a0[de] in 1981.[5] Angelika Barbe joined the peace circle in 1986.[2] In 1987 she was a co-founder, with Marianne Eschenhagen, of the Women's Working Group in Berlin's Johannisthal quarter (\"Johannisthaler Frauenarbeitskreise\").[3] During 1988/89 she became involved in the Peace Working Group around Ulrike Poppe, Jens Reich and Marianne Birthler.[2] As political tensions rose, especially in the cities, she came under state surveillance in the Ministry for State Security's so-called \"Operation Hysteria\".[2]/nBarbe was one of the small group of people who on 7 October 1989 formed a new incarnation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Berlin area (initially) of East Germany.[6] She was voted the party's number 2 spokesperson and, in January 1990, its deputy chair.[2] After reunification in October 1990 the East German SDP merged into the West German SPD, which left Angelika Barbe a prominent member of what was, at that point, Germany's second largest political party in terms of vote share./nMeanwhile, in March 1990 East Germany held its first and - as matters turned out - last free and fair general election. The SDP's 21.9% vote share entitled it to 88 of the 400 seats in the national parliament (Volkskammer), and Angelika Barbe, as a candidate, was high enough up on the party list to be elected. She was a member between March and October 1990, serving as chair of the parliamentary committee on women and family.[3]/nAfter reunification she became a member of the Bundestag between December 1990 and November 1994, elected as part of the SPD party list for the Berlin electoral district. Despite being a member of the SPD party executive during that period, her uncompromising clarity of thought and expression within the party made Barbe the opposite of a natural political networker.[7] She was not favoured by the party officials in Berlin with an easily winnable position on the national party list, instead being pitched against Gregor Gysi of the PDS in the East Berlin electoral district.[7] She was not re-elected in 1994, and a period of unemployment followed.[2]/nBetween 1995 and 1998 she worked as a senior hospital administrator in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg quarter. She nevertheless remained politically concerned, in December 1996 switching her political allegiance from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) to the CDU (centre-right party) because she objected to her SPD party (former) comrades entering into political alliances with the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS).[4] She was joined in switching from national left-wing parties to the CDU by other former citizen rights activists from the East German period, such as G\u00fcnter Nooke and Vera Lengsfeld.[8] It was also in 1996 that Barbe was a co-founder of the Berlin Citizens' Office for Evaluating the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship (\"Berliner B\u00fcrgerb\u00fcro zur Aufarbeitung von Folgesch\u00e4den der SED-Diktatur\").[2]/nIn 2001 she became a member of the National Executive of the umbrella organisation for Communist Tyranny Victims' Associations (\"Union der Opferverb\u00e4nde Kommunistischer Gewaltherrschaft\" / UOKG),[9] serving as the organisation's deputy chair until 2007.[2] She has also been actively involved between 2000 and 2017 (when she retired) with the Saxony Regional Office for Political Education (\"S\u00e4chsische Landeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung\").[2]", "29583414": "William Hayes FRCPI FRS[1] FRSE LLD (18 January 1913 \u2013 7 January 1994) was an Irish geneticist./nHe was born in Rathfarnham, Co Dublin, the only son of William Hayes, a successful Dublin pharmacist, and his second wife, Miriam, n\u00e9e Harris.

She has represented New Zealand in cycling./nWood has a PhD from Victoria University of Wellington, with a thesis on microcystins in New Zealand freshwater organisms.[1] From 2006 to 2009, Wood worked as a  Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST) Post-Doctoral Researcher (Cawthron and Waikato University).[2][3] She has held honorary positions as a lecturer as Waikato University (2007\u20132011), and as honorary research associate, biological sciences, Victoria University (2010).  Wood was senior research fellow, biological sciences, at Waikato University from 2011 to 2017, and since 2018 has been a senior adjunct fellow, Waterways Centre for Freshwater Management, University of Canterbury.[4] Wood was employed at Cawthron Institute as a scientist in 2005 as scientist, Freshwater & Biotechnology groups in 2005,  and from 2014 has been  a senior scientist, Coastal & Freshwater group, Cawthon.[2]/nA report co-authored by Wood on the survey of cyanotoxins in New Zealand water bodies between 2001 and 2004, noted that \"contamination of drinking and recreational water bodies by toxic cyanobacteria is a significant water management issue in many countries...[with]...potential for a significant threat to human and animal health\".[5]/nEarlier research by Wood while she was a PhD student had identified microcystin toxins from more than 80 water bodies in New Zealand and in 2003, this was published in a newsletter with a focus on the issue of cyanobacterial bloom in several New Zealand lakes. In the newsletter, Wood explained the difficulties of detecting and monitoring cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins and because algal blooms can appear or disappear very quickly, stressed the importance of continuous monitoring of bodies of water with known problems.[6]/nIn November 2005 the stomach contents of one of five dogs that had died rapidly after contact with water from the Hutt River were examined. Wood participated in research that provided evidence, for the first time, that homoanatoxin-a and anatoxin-a, two toxic cyanobacteria, were likely to have caused the sudden death of the dog. The report concluded that further detection of these cyanotoxins in other rivers in the Wellington region and instances of the unexpected death of stock gave reason for concern about the health risk to animals and humans.[7] Wood explained in a later news article that finding the contents in the stomach of dogs had confirmed the need for research to inform people that  Cyanobacteria was often present in rivers and while it should always be treated as potentially toxic, it was most dangerous when it formed mats. Wood noted that there may be \"tens of kilometres of New Zealand rivers covered with cyanobacteria mats producing the potentially lethal neurotoxin...[and]...in certain regions it [posed] a huge health risk\".[8]/nWood has been a strong advocate for the use of DNA-based tools to analyse samples and is a member of the  Environmental Metagenomics team.[9]/nFurther research focused on the value of these tools, and in 2015 Wood co-authored a journal article which concluded that  genomics \"provides an exciting new avenue to explore the genetic basis of toxin synthesis in complex environmental samples\".[10]/nWood participated in a 2016 case study that evaluated two high-throughput sequencing methods of biomonitoring using DNA techniques on samples collected from 12 New Zealand rivers.[11]/nIn  2017, research led by Wood noted the importance of developing molecular techniques \u2013 such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction \u2013 to identify blue-green algal cyanobacterial cells (Phormidium) in water and distinguish toxic from nontoxic genotypes in microbial mat communities.[12]/nA 2020 paper, co-authored by Wood, summarised the work done since 2013 on toxic freshwater benthic cyanobacteria. It covered areas such as knowledge about the identification and distribution of toxin-producing benthic freshwater cyanobacteria and how to build an understanding of the factors that affect this; the effects of toxic benthic cyanobacteria on the ecosystem and animal health; and studies on toxic benthic cyanobacteria which had used -omics techniques such as metabarcoding, genomics and  metagenomics.[13]/nBecause of the uneven distribution of cyanobacterial cells and toxins on lake sediment, Wood and her team in 2020, made the case for employing molecular techniques \u2013 such as metabarcoding \u2013 to reconstruct historical cyanobacteria communities, as opposed to taking one sample which may not be representative of the whole lake. The paper held this would provide long term data that relates historical change with the prevalence of cyanobacterial bloom.[14]/nA 2021 study looked at the use of HSP-based metabarcoding and metagenomics, to characterize and assess the effects of fish farming on benthic ecosystems. The paper, co-authored by Wood, concluded that both approaches \u2013 although providing different functional profiles \u2013 are effective tools for providing data on the  effects of fish farming on benthic ecosystems.[15]/nWood was involved in a 2014 investigation into the nature of microcystins in New Zealand waterways that considered the likelihood of anthropogenic eutrophication of lakes, ponds and oceans creating favourable conditions for the rapid growth of some cyanobacterial species, including microcystin.[16] She also contributed to the publication Impacts of Climate Change for New Zealand (2017), a document that contained a summary of how climate change can impact the potential harm from algal blooms.[17]/nA  review of the impact of climate change on New Zealand lakes, co-authored by Wood, identified that New Zealand freshwater ecosystems were vulnerable to climate change impacts and increased levels of CO2 can alter the biogeochemical processes that affect the dynamics of cyanobacteria specifically blooms.[18]/nIn 2014, Wood noted that studies have looked at variables such as water quality, temperature, oxygen content, and pH values, yet she concluded it was not contaminated waterways due to dairying that caused blooms of cyanobacterial mats in rivers, but more likely the felling of trees close to a river which caused a runoff resulting in high amounts of sediments. Wood has suggested that leaving uncut forest buffer zones of 100 metres beside rivers could make \"a huge difference\" to the amount of sediment washed in by rain.[8]/nAnother study in which Wood was involved, looked into the potential effects of climate change on cyanobacterial communities. The study found \"a positive relationship was identified between microcystin quotas and surface water temperature...[and]...these results highlight[ed] the complex successional interplay of cyanobacteria species and demonstrated the importance of climate through its effect on nutrient concentrations, water temperature, and stratification\".[19] Wood co-authored a paper in 2019 that reviewed research on understanding cyanobacteria within global changes resulting from climate change.  The review noted cyanobacteria do play an important part in environmental cycles and food webs but stressed that this anthropogenic eutrophication played a major role in the increased production of toxins that have adverse effects on water quality and fish and \"whole-system and multiple-system studies are needed to improve confidence in models predicting impacts of climate change and anthropogenic over-enrichment and hydrological modifications\".[20]/nIn a media interview on 17 January 2022, Wood made the case that rising water temperatures within New Zealand waterways could result in an increase of Cynobacteria containing cynatoxins, causing possible long-term health issues for people. She noted the danger of these toxins building up in food such as fish, crayfish and shellfish which if eaten, according to Wood, \"could cause irreversible liver damage in humans, and even promote liver damage\".[21] Wood said that recreational water users in New Zealand were at risk because of the algal blooms on riverbanks or in water which could be accidentally swallowed. Wood concluded that \"algal blooms are a symptom of human impact on the landscape...[and]...the flow-on effects from cleaning up our waterways would be important in managing the risks long-term\".[21] In the same article it was explained that New Zealand Councils had monitoring systems in place which informed people about which swimming spots were safe for swimming,[22] and in a later interview on the same topic, Wood said that while councils were doing a good job with the monitoring, people must  bring any areas of concern about local swimming areas to their regional council.[23]/nWood contributed to a 2007 paper that identified risks associated with toxic planktonic cyanobacteria in drinking water, and highlighted the need for national guidance and policies for tackling the complex issues associated with benthic cyanobacteria which were not covered by the official government guidelines at the time,' Drinking-Water Standards for New Zealand 2005' and 'Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality Management for New Zealand 2005'. The document stressed that  \"further research is required in New Zealand to establish the extent and latent risks posed by benthic cyanobacteria, particularly in drinking water supplies.\"[7] In 2009, Wood co-authored the New Zealand Guidelines for  Cyanobacteria in Recreational Fresh Waters \u2013 Interim Guidelines for the New Zealand government. The document aimed to provide a \"monitoring framework for establishing the public health risk from cyanobacteria associated with contact recreation in lakes (mainly planktonic cyanobacteria) and rivers (mainly benthic cyanobacteria)\".[24]/nIn an international publication, Current approaches to Cyanotoxin risk assessment, risk management and regulations in different countries (2012), Wood summarised the documents that were guiding the regulation and management of cyanobacteria in New Zealand at the time. The summary noted that research had shown planktonic  cyanobacteria in New Zealand produced a range of cyanotoxins, including  anatoxin-a which had been shown to cause the death of animals, and saxitoxins in benthic mats that were likely to have contributed to humans becoming sick using the water recreationally. These concerns, as well as those around the safety of drinking water, are addressed in the government guidelines revised in 2008.[25]/nWood co-authored a 2018 study commissioned by the NZ Ministry of the Environment to inform the development of a National Objectives Framework for the management of anatoxins in waters affected by Phormidium blooms. The report noted this study showed data would provide valuable information for the development of human health risk assessment models related to toxic blooms in rivers.[26] Another study for the Ministry of the Environment (2018), made recommendations to a review of the 'Interim New Zealand Guidelines for Cyanobacteria in Recreational Fresh Waters', including updating the cyanobacteria alert-level framework, conducting further research to identify the health risks of benthic cyanobacteria in lakes and addressing the knowledge gaps to determine the risk posed by anatoxin in rivers.[27]/nWood was invited to be a member of the NZ Ministry of Health, Drinking-water Advisory Committee (2018) which conducted a review of the regulations, leading to a reviewed set of Standards with a section on cyanotoxin compliance criteria.[28]/nIn 2017 Wood became joint programme leader for Our Lakes Health; past, present and future (Lakes380), a MBIE funded five-year research project that aimed to improve water quality in New Zealand lakes by using scientific tools to collect and analyse water samples, lake bottom sediment samples and cores which are natural archives of the environmental history of aquatic communities and water quality. The project is co-lead by the Cawthron Institute and GNS Science.[29] Wood commented that the project would provide information to understand what was driving environmental change and to inform initiatives to restore the ecological vitality of New Zealand lakes.[30] On RNZ, Wood explained that the sediment cores would be analysed using DNA techniques to understand how and why the biological communities have changed, and gave an example of eDNA revealing the coinciding of cyanobacterial blooms in one lake with the introduction of introduced species of fish such as trout and European perch in the 1870s. This knowledge informed a restoration plan for the lake.[31]/nWood has acknowledged that the lakes in the project had cultural importance to the local iwi, because they were often \"important sites for mahinga kai (traditional food gathering)\". She said that working with Ng\u0101ti Kuri using environmental DNA and scanning techniques to measure the current and past biodiversity of past biodiversity of lakes in the far north of New Zealand, [was] \"a unique opportunity to learn from their long association with these lakes and further enrich our knowledge of these precious places\".[32] In 2020, it was announced that the Lakes380 Research Project would undertake the largest sampling of lakes ever undertaken in the Waikato area. Wood noted that during the sampling, there would be considerable engagement with local Iwi, [who are] \"important partners in this project because one of our major goals is to ensure our lakes are valued and protected \u2013 now and for generations to come and our ability to do so is greatly enhanced by incorporating m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and indigenous knowledge into the research\".[33]/nWhile researching lakes in the Rotorua area, the Lakes380 Team worked with  Partnership Through Collaboration  to offer an educational opportunity for students to take part in the extraction and analysis of lake sediment.[34]/nA collaboration between Lakes380 and researchers at the University of Windsor was confirmed in 2020 and Wood acknowledged it was an important opportunity to learn about their  \"metagenetic techniques\" and how they could be used in New Zealand environments.[35]/n2020: Keynote Speaker, as part of the Lakes380 team, at Weathering the Storm, a joint conference  organised by the NZ Hydrological Society, Rivers Group and Freshwater Science Society, with  papers covering all aspects of Hydrology, River System Management and Freshwater Science.[40]/n2019: Keynote speaker, 11th International Toxic Cyanobacteria Conference, Poland.[41]/n2019: Presented \"Toxic Cyanobacteria: Ancient Organisms Thriving in the Anthropocene\" at the Urbanization, Water and Food Security Gordon Research Conference.[42]/n2018: Presented at the 6th Australian and New Zealand Cyanobacteria Workshop, 25 September 2018, UNSW Sydney.[43]/n2016: Presented on the topic 'Risky rivers: identifying river susceptibility and factors that promote benthic Phormidium proliferations', at the Fifth National Cyanobacterial Workshop Brisbane, 29\u201330 September 2016.[44]/nIn 2019, Wood was the winner of the New Zealand Freshwater Sciences Society Medal, \"For her outstanding contribution to freshwater science and management, and her leadership of women in science.\"[45]/nWood has represented New Zealand as a cyclist at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup in 2006.[46][47] In 2009 she was second in the XTERRA New Zealand event,[48] and prior to taking part in a triathlon in Nelson in 2012, this success was acknowledged, with a local news article noting Wood was \"strong on the road bike and can run pretty quickly on the flat\".[49] Speaking at the  Nelson Mail and Network Tasman Top Student Awards in 2012, Wood said that passion, making the most of opportunities and learning from experience were what had driven her as a cyclist. She noted in her talk [that] \"opportunity is a bird that never perches...[and]...learn backwards from experiences, but live forwards\".[50] Wood was a winner of the Reg Davies Memorial Trophy in 2014.[51]", "60090471": "Dorothea Fiedler is a chemical biologist and also the first female director of the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Molekulare Pharmakologie (Leibniz Research Institute for Molecular Pharmacology, FMP) in Berlin, Germany./nFiedler grew up in Hamburg.[1] She studied inorganic chemistry at the University of W\u00fcrzburg,[2] then carried out doctorate research on organometallic chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.[1][3]/nAlthough her PhD research focussed on organometallic chemistry[4][5] including host-guest systems and applications to catalysis,[6][7] Fiedler became interested in cellular signal transduction pathways during her postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Francisco.[1][8] She started her independent career as an assistant professor at Princeton University in 2010.[9] Her research focuses on the synthesis and signalling roles of inositol phosphates,[10] in particular, those with a pyrophosphate functionality,[11][12][13][14] which has relevance to cellular signalling and cancer biology.[15][16]/nIn 2015, Fiedler became the director of the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut f\u00fcr Molekulare Pharmakologie as well as a professor of chemistry at the Humboldt University of Berlin.[17] She continues developing her research focus on the synthesis and signalling roles of protein modifications involving pyrophosphates,[18][19] as well as building collaborations on biological chemistry and catalysis.[20]/nFiedler has received a New Innovator Award totalling over $2 million from the NIH in 2013.[21] She also received funding from the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research[22][23] and the Rita Allen Foundation.[24] During her postdoctoral research, she received the Ernst Schering Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, was on the Fastrack Program of the Robert Bosch Foundation, and obtained an NIH Pathway to Independence Award.[25]/nFiedler is an invited speaker at the EMBO conference on Chemical Biology 2016[26] and at the International Symposium on Bioorganic Chemistry in 2017.[27]/nFiedler is one of the local organizers of the 42nd National Organic Chemistry Symposium by the organic division of the American Chemical Society in 2011.[28]", "48654441": "Ernest James Goddard (20 February 1883 \u2013 17 January 1948), was an Australian professor of biology./nErnest James Goddard was born on 20 February 1883 in Newcastle, New South Wales, one of six sons born to Alfred and Elizabeth Goddard. He attended Maitland High School and then his family moved to Sydney for his and his brother's education at the University of Sydney[1] where he studied first a B.A. in 1904, and then took a BSc in 1906, with honours in zoology and palaeontology./nGoddard was appointed a junior demonstrator in Biology while in the final years of his Science degree, and also upon his graduation in 1906. Professor Edgeworth David employed him as a biologist for the Royal Society Expedition of Fiji.[2][3][4] Upon his return from Fiji in 1908, Goddard became a Macleay Linnean Research Fellow in Zoology at the University of Sydney. He received the first D.Sc. degree awarded by the University of Sydney in 1910.[5] Much of the content of this dissertation was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. This led to his being offered the Chair of Zoology, Geology and Mineralogy at Victoria College, (Stellenbosch University from 1918), South Africa. The Department of Geology would be later split from his role, and he would mainly oversee zoology.[6]/nGoddard continued to publish, especially in the areas of his PhD research on leeches and earthworms.[6] He undertook a zoological survey of South Africa upon commencing work there, and chose a site for the South African Marine Biological and Oceanographic Station. Many of his papers considered the Antarctic; he attempted to mount an expedition there, never obtained funding .[6]/nGoddard was interested in many social questions. Following WW1, racial tensions in South Africa increased. Despite making his zoology department the largest in South Africa, and being selected to join the Quest expedition to Antarctica as an oceanographer and marine biologist in 1922,[2] Goddard applied for the Chair of Biology at the University of Queensland and was successful, taking up the post in 1923./nAt Brisbane, Goddard  was an active organiser and public speaker, promoting science in the public arena though lectures and newspaper publicity.[3][7][8] He was especially interested in agricultural and economic biology,  particularly entomology. He spoke on the use of cactoblastis in prickly pear eradication[2] and was supervisor of the Bunchy Top Investigation committee, investigating this disease in bananas, in 1924.[9]/nGoddard became the first Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture in 1927. He then became involved with the establishment of a Faculty of Medicine, especially a degree in Dentistry. After many years of negotiation and with Goddard defending his department's biology courses in the Dentistry Diploma course, the Faculty of Dentistry was established in 1935 with Goddard as the first dean. From 1931, Goddard worked toward establishing a Medical School, even getting the Masonic Lodge to donate their old building for an Anatomy School. In 1935, Goddard acted as spokesman on a visit to the Queensland Premier, William Forgan Smith, and was so persuasive that it was announced in Parliament the next day that a Faculty of Medicine would be established in 1936.[2]/nOther programs Goddard worked upon included establishing a Physiotherapy course, which came into being after the Faculty of Medicine was approved. He was particularly keen to establish a marine biology station in Queensland and attempted to persuade the University Senate to purchase Dunk Island in 1927, and  continued to put forward a number of island options over the next 20 years.[10] Glass houses and laboratories for plant pathology, entomology and an insectarium were acquired through grant money and a forestry course commenced in 1924.[2]/nGoddard helped form the Entomological Society of Queensland in 1923. He was President of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1927, the Queensland Naturalists' Club, and the Australian-American Association. He was Chairman of the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science.[3] From 1936\u20131939 he was seconded to the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock as science coordinating officer.[6]/nIn a paper to the zoology section of the A.N.Z.A.A.S,[11] Goddard appealed for \"an end to anthropocentrism in the study of Man. Instead he called for the \"discovery, elucidation and dissemination of principles that will enable us to envisage with scientific precision the interdependence and inter-reaction of the animal organism or individual and its environment\".[12]/nWhile setting up the marine biology research station at Heron Island[13] which he had toiled to establish and where he planned to retire to continue research, Goddard died of a heart attack on 17 January 1948.

A mestizo and a radical liberal, he was fiercely anticlerical, perhaps an atheist, and his early writings against the Catholic Church in Mexico gained him a reputation as a leading liberal thinker.[1] Ocampo has been considered the heir to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora, the premier liberal intellectual of the early republic.[2] He served in the administration of Benito Ju\u00e1rez and negotiated a controversial agreement with the United States, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty.  The Mexican state where his hometown of Maravat\u00edo is located was later renamed Michoac\u00e1n de Ocampo in his honor./nMelchor Ocampo was perhaps orphaned and left abandoned at the gate of a hacienda of a wealthy woman, Do\u00f1a Francisca Xaviera Tapia, who raised him as her own and bequeathed him her property.[3][4]/nOcampo studied at the Roman Catholic seminary in Morelia, Michoac\u00e1n, and later law at the Colegio Seminario de M\u00e9xico (Universidad Pontificia). He began working in a law office in 1833. For unknown reasons, he left the practice of law and returned to his hacienda, perhaps because of its imminent bankruptcy.[5] In 1840, he traveled to France, where he was influenced by liberal and anticlerical ideas of the Enlightenment following the French Revolution. He returned after a year to Michoac\u00e1n to work his lands, practice law, investigate the region's flora and fauna, and study the local indigenous languages.[6] More importantly, he entered politics in Michoacan, in opposition to Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna./nOcampo was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1842. In 1844, Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza became president of Mexico and appointed Ocampo Governor of Michoac\u00e1n. during the U.S. Invasion (1846\u201348). He was an activist governor, reorganizing the state treasury, building roads, proposing the founding of schools, and improving the conditions of the national guard in Michoac\u00e1n. During the Mexican\u2013American War he recruited troops without conscription or increased taxes, but solely by persuasion.[7] Ocampo urged that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican\u2013American War be rejected.[8] As governor, Ocampo appointed Santos Degollado the rector of the Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s de Hidalgo, where revolutionary Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla had served prior to his exile to the village of Dolores.  Degollado later was murdered seeking the murderers of his patron Ocampo.[9]/nOcampo's beliefs were fiercely anticlerical and challenged the power of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. He viewed the church as sucking wealth from indigenous people with high clerical fees for ecclesiastical services, and impeding progress. He pointed to high clerical fees for ecclesiastical services and the proliferation of fiestas, which encouraged idleness and drunkenness. These provided income for local priests as well as further impoverishing indigenous people who bought candles, incense, and fireworks. Clerical fees for Christian sacraments meant that birth, marriage, and death generated income for priests who charged for baptism, holy matrimony, and burial. A vivid story he related about this practice concerned a peasant who could not afford the burial fees for his son and asked for a free burial. \"The priest refused, contending that 'this was what he lived on.' The poor man had asked, 'Sir, what shall I do with my dead son?' and the priest had answered him, 'Salt him and eat him'.\"[10] The church had the responsibility for education in Mexico and like other aspects of the church's role in Mexico, access was based on the ability to pay.  Ocampo advocated free, public, secular education in Mexico. He believed that education had to be grounded on the basic postulates of liberalism, democracy, respect and tolerance for different beliefs, equality before the law, the elimination of privileges, and the supremacy of civil authority. Many of these ideas were later codified in the Reform laws and the liberal Constitution of 1857.[11]/nHe began a published polemical debate with a priest or a group of priests in Michoac\u00e1n about the reform of clerical fees. Historian Enrique Krauze suggests that the priest was probably Clemente de Jes\u00fas Mung\u00eda, the bishop of Morelia, the state capital.[12] Ocampo was subsequently deposed as governor and was forced to flee the country by President Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, taking refuge first in Cuba and then in the U.S. city of New Orleans, Louisiana. In New Orleans he met a group of fellow liberal exiles, including Benito Ju\u00e1rez.[13] Ocampo began to publish pamphlets to promote political change in Mexico. He returned to Mexico in 1855 following the successful ouster of Santa Anna under the Plan de Ayutla. The plan had called for the overthrow of Santa Anna and the installation of the liberal general Juan \u00c1lvarez as president of Mexico. With \u00c1lvarez's victory, Ocampo served briefly in his cabinet as foreign minister, but when \u00c1lvarez stepped down and Ignacio Comonfort became president, Ocampo returned to Michoac\u00e1n.  He was then elected to the Constitutional Convention that drafted the liberal Constitution of 1857, which included strong provisions for the separation of Church and State.[14]/nDuring Benito Ju\u00e1rez's administration during the civil war between liberals and conservatives, known as the War of the Reform, Ocampo served in various high posts, including Minister of the Interior, with responsibility also for foreign affairs, defense, and the treasury. Ocampo became embroiled in a bitter dispute about the implementation of the Lerdo Law, which called for the sale of property of corporations, meaning the Roman Catholic Church and indigenous communities which was aimed at undermining the economic power of the church and creating a yeoman peasantry of small landowners. Ocampo charged that the law was counterproductive, strengthening the power of the church and preventing the acquisition of land by those of modest means.[15]/nThe most controversial act of Ocampo was negotiating the McLane-Ocampo Treaty in 1859, when he served the Liberal government of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. The regime was strapped for cash to pursue the War of the Reform against conservatives. In the port of Veracruz, on 14 December 1859, acting on Ju\u00e1rez's orders, he and U.S. Ambassador Robert Milligan McLane signed the treaty. This controversial treaty would have awarded the United States perpetual transit rights, for its armies and merchandise, through three zones of Mexico's territory: the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; a corridor running from Guaymas, Sonora, to Nogales, Arizona; and a second transoceanic route from  Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa, on the Pacific to Brownsville, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. The treaty was aimed at getting U.S. recognition for the Ju\u00e1rez government and gain the regime two million dollars in much needed funding. Ocampo did attach an appendix, attempting to protect Mexican sovereignty. Although presidents Ju\u00e1rez and Buchanan were both in favor of the arrangement, the U.S. Senate rejected it on 31 May 1860 on account of the impending Civil War in the United States.[16]  Ocampo traveled to the U.S. to ascertain if that it would support the liberal cause if they were unable to defeat the conservatives on the battlefield. The treaty exacerbated the rancor between Ocampo and Miguel Lerdo de Tejada and Ocampo resigned from Ju\u00e1rez's cabinet in January 1860,.[17] Ju\u00e1rez rejected the treaty in November 1860.[18]/nWith the defeat of the conservatives in the War of the Reform in 1860, Mexican presidential elections were held. Ocampo might have been a candidate, but backed Ju\u00e1rez against his rival Miguel Lerdo. \"Ju\u00e1rez may have needed the such help, for even though president, he was viewed by many as second rate in comparison to Ocampo and Lerdo.\"[19]  By 1861, both Miguel Lerdo and Ocampo were both dead, with Ocampo murdered by conservative guerrillas after he returned to civilian life./nSome months after retiring from public service, Melchor Ocampo was abducted from his hacienda in Michoac\u00e1n by conservative guerrillas on orders from either Leonardo M\u00e1rquez or F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga or both (reports differ). The historian Enrique Krauze gives a vivid account of Ocampo's last days, saying that Ocampo's captors allowed him to write his will, where he recognized his natural daughters and identified their mother, information the children did not know. Ocampo was executed by firing squad on 3 June 1861 at the Hacienda of Tlaltengo, Tepeji del R\u00edo, in what is today the state of Hidalgo. After the firing squad, his execution included \"the finishing bullet in the head, [and] they hung the body of Melchor Ocampo from a tree.\"[20] His loyal follower, Santos Degollado, pursued Ocampo's executioners and \"was himself ambushed, captured, and executed by the conservatives.[21] Ocampo's murder was a scandal, and Ju\u00e1rez's government took \"more extreme measures\" to repress the conservatives.[22] The remains of Ocampo are interred in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres in Mexico City./nHe participated in writing new Civil Laws, that in the end would give sense to liberal politics and would end up amending the Constitution from 1857, in order to make civil and political matters independent from ecclesiastic ones.

He became a faculty member at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 2002.[citation needed]/nKarlseder discovered that telomere dysfunction plays a role in Werner Syndrome, a premature aging disease that is associated with early onset of cancer. WRN helicase, which is mutated in Werner Syndrome patients, is required for efficient replication of the telomeric G-strand.[2] Without WRN, lagging strand replication frequently stalls at telomeres, leading to loss of one of the sister telomeres during replication and cell division. This telomere loss in turn can lead to telomere end-to-end fusions, fusion-bridge-breakage cycles and genome instability, which is responsible for the heightened cancer incidence in individuals with Werner Syndrome.[3] He went on to show that following DNA replication telomeres are recognized by the intracellular DNA damage machinery.[4] This seemingly paradoxical event turned out to be essential to recruit the machinery that establishes protection at chromosome ends, where the homologous recombination machinery acts to form a structure that is resistant to nucleases and damage repair.[5]/nKarlseder\u2019s work on DNA repair pathway choice led to the discovery of the microprotein CYREN, which inhibits error prone non-homologous end-joining during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, thereby promoting DNA break repair by the error free homologous recombination machinery.[6]/nKarlseder discovered that mitotic arrest leads to telomere deprotection, which triggers a stress response that leads to the \u00a0death of cells that cannot complete mitosis. He demonstrated that this process is at play during replicative crisis, where fused telomeres trigger mitotic arrest and in turn cell death within one or two cell cycles.[7][8]/nKarlseder\u2019s work on recombination-based telomere maintenance (ALT) revealed that constitutive damage signals from shortening telomeres down-regulate histone synthesis, which leads to changes in nucleosome availability and histone chaperone expression.[9] This led to the discovery that replication fork stalling at telomeres plays a major role in the activation of ALT.[10]/nHe found that cell death in replicative crisis is executed by the autophagy machinery. Autophagy suppression allowed cells to bypass crisis and continue to proliferate with critically short telomeres, accumulating high levels of genome instability, pointing at autophagy as a potent tumor suppressor during the earliest stages of cancer initiation.[11]/nKarlseder\u2019s work on connecting telomere dysfunction with inflammation and cell death during replicative crisis identified ZBP1 as novel regulator of the innate RNA sensing machinery. He discovered that cells in replicative crisis use the telomeric transcript TERRA as messenger to sense critically short telomeres. TERRA associates with the innate RNA sensor ZBP1, which in turn forms filaments at the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it activates its adaptor MAVS, resulting in an amplification of an interferon type 1 inflammation response. Karlseder thereby discovered a novel tumor suppressive pathway, which removes aged cells with critically short telomeres, which would be prone to cancerous transformation.[12]", "72640671": "Lorande Loss Woodruff (July 14, 1879 \u2013 June 23, 1947) was an American biologist, notable for his exhaustive studies of unicelluar eukaryotes, especially ciliates; and for his long tenure as a trustee of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

He became a member of the MBL board in 1923 and served until his death, twenty-four years later.[2]/nWoodruff's original scientific research was entirely on ciliates, unicellular eukaryotes with hair-like organelles\u2014the cilia. A matter of interest in his time was whether sexual reproduction, involving the conjugation of two organisms with fusion and repartition of their nucleii (we would now say: recombination of their DNA), was obligate for protists\u2014and, if so, which species and how often. It was known that Paramecium aurelia generally reproduced asexually (i.e., by fissioning into two identical daughters), but that it did occasionally conjugate and reproduce sexually. Over eight years, Woodruff raised 5,000 successive generations of P. aurelia in a manner that precluded conjugation, providing strong evidence (later increased to 24,000 generations) that purely asexual reproduction could continue indefinitely.[2][1]/nHonored in his time, Woodruff was a member and officer of many scientific societies and was considered one of the best-known American biologists worldwide. He was interested in the history of biology and gave a graduate course in the subject. But, ironically, history has not been kind to his own work. The ciliates (indeed all the protists) are now understood to be much more complex than was understood in Woodruff's time. The question of whether homologous recombination of their DNA is a required feature on evolutionary time scales is a deep one, not like to be answered by any simple set of experiments. Writing only a few months after Woodruff's death in 1947, G. Evelyn Hutchinson (often known as the \"father of modern ecology\") wrote: \"In retrospect, Woodruff's career seems unspectacular but extremely useful. A true servant of science and education, his contributions are built solidly into the fabric of our culture but can now be identified only by those with long memories or an exceptional interest in the past....

Doctor Weekes is considered by many as the pioneer of modern anxiety treatment and has written several books on dealing with anxiety disorders.[1] Many of today's self-help books on anxiety continue to cite her work./nWeekes found that many of her patients suffered from various anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia, panic attacks, phobias, generalised anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In her books, she chose to avoid the term \"nervous breakdown\", as much as possible, as she considered the term vague, unscientific and unnecessarily alarming. Weekes also avoided the term \"Anxiety State\" as she felt it was too \"medical\", so she replaced both terms with \"Nervous Illness\" instead.[2]/nWeekes was concerned with the severe long-term effects anxiety and panic disorders had on the lives of her patients as well as the high failure of typical psychiatric treatments, especially psychoanalysis, which many sufferers had tried. Instead, Weekes developed her own unique treatment program. She noted that patients did not suffer from  anxiety problems because they had flawed personalities or traumatic childhoods; rather, the problems were caused by the patient having a habit of fear-avoidance, made worse, or caused, by a very responsive \"sensitized\" nervous system.[3] She was critical both of Freudian approaches and of attempts by behaviorists to \"desensitize\" their patients using relaxation and breathing techniques.[4]/nWeekes described in her books the three main pitfalls that lead to Nervous Illness. They are sensitization, bewilderment and fear. She explained that so much nervous illness is no more than severe sensitization kept alive by bewilderment and fear.[5] Dr. Weekes analyzed fear as two separate fears; the first fear and the second fear. She explained that first fear is the fear that comes reflexively, almost automatically. The patient usually immediately recoils from it, and as he/she does, he/she adds a second fear to the first. Second fear is the fear the patient adds to the first fear. Examples of second fear are \"Oh, my goodness! Here it is again! I can't stand it!\". It is the second fear that is keeping the first fear alive, keeping the sufferer sensitized and keeping them nervously ill.[6]/nWeekes initially used the program on her own patients and then, as word spread of its success, it was issued on records and cassette tapes. Eventually, she developed a self-help pack consisting of a book and tape, with Weekes guiding patients through the program. She has summarized this program as follows; facing the feared situation, accepting the feeling of panic, floating through it, and letting time pass.[7]/nSelf Help For Your Nerves (1962) (US title: Hope and Help for Your Nerves), Weekes' first book, has sold more than 300,000 copies and has been translated into fourteen languages. It was followed by Peace from Nervous Suffering (1972),  Simple Effective Treatment of Agoraphobia (1976) and More Help for Your Nerves (1984). Her fifth and final book The Latest Help for Your Nerves (1989) was published one year before her death./nIn 1983, Dr. Weekes was interviewed in a series of six talks, called Peace From Nervous Suffering, on the British national TV program Pebble Mill at One, in which she explained her techniques. A transcription of these talks along with two BBC radio interviews and two interviews at White Plains Hospital in New York, were published in her final book The Latest Help for Your Nerves./nIn all five of her books, Weekes offers self-help methods and advice. Her work was marked by the personal nature of her approach. Early in her career she had earned both a Doctorate of Science as well as an M.D./nWeekes described her own battle with nervous illness in her final book in which she explained how she began suffering from anxiety. At the age of 26, she was misdiagnosed with Tuberculosis which caused her to become anxious and introverted. Weekes' anxiety lasted for two years and gave her valuable insight into nervous illness.[8] Dr. Robert L. Dupont describes in his book The Anxiety Cure (1998) that in 1983, he asked Weekes if she had ever had panic disorder. She replied \"Yes, I have had what you call panic attacks. In fact, I still have them. Sometimes they wake me at night.\" Dr. DuPont responded by saying he was sorry to hear that. He described Claire Weekes as looking at him in shock, and she responded \"Save your sympathy for someone else. I don't need it or want it. What you call a panic attack is merely a few normal chemicals that are temporarily out of place in my brain. It is of no significance whatsoever to me!\"[9]/nToday, many doctors may be unaware of her books, but they are still in print and her work is promoted by an organization in Australia set up by her heirs. Over six decades, Dr. Weekes' first three books have brought life-changing relief to hundreds of thousands of people suffering from anxiety and panic disorders around the world. Although Doctor Weekes has been deceased since 1990, at least half of Amazon.com's customer reviews state that one of her books \"saved my life\".[citation needed]/nWeekes' early work on the subject of reproduction and placentation in reptiles is held in high regard  and is often cited by researchers in the field./nClaire Weekes began her career as a research scientist, receiving her D Sc in 1930 from the University of Sydney; she was the first woman to attain that degree from the university.  Initially working under Prof. Launcelot Harrison, she conducted research on reproduction and placentation in viviparous (live-bearing) lizards from 1925\u20131934; part of this period (1929\u20131931) was spent in England in the lab of J.P. Hill.  Weekes' work led to eight published papers, including a major summary published in 1935 in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Weekes' work provided the basis an understanding of reptile placentation that lasted for nearly 50 years. More recent work has continued to build on the empirical and conceptual framework that she established.[10][11] Weekes' research on the complex placentae of Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii was instrumental in the establishment of the species as a model organism for studying the evolution of pregnancy.[12][13]/nClaire Weekes' published papers in reproductive biology of reptiles:", "29321387": "Baldo Angelo Abati (in Latin Baldus Angelus Abatius; born in Gubbio) was an Italian physician and naturalist.

He was among the first to describe the formation of species through geographic separation of breeding populations. He developed early ideas on the founder effect and what is now known as the Baldwin effect. He coined the term \"divergent evolution\".[1]/nGulick was born in Waimea on Kaua\u02bbi Island, during the Kingdom of Hawaii. His father was missionary Peter Johnson Gulick (1796\u20131877) and mother was Fanny Hinckley Thomas Gulick (1798\u20131883). Early in life he went to Oregon and sought gold in California. In 1851, he started to collect and study Hawaiian land snails. He had been interested in snails (a field now known as Conchology) since his early teens, and developed independently the concept of their evolution. He discovered many species of snails were only found in very specific areas within the islands, and there was no overlap between these areas.[2]/nIn 1853, after reading Charles Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle and Hugh Miller's The Footprints of the Creator, Gulick presented his paper, \"The Distribution of Plants and Animals\", to the Punahou School Debating Society. In 1855, he enrolled for one year at New York University and then Williams College in Massachusetts, and studied in their Lyceum of Natural History. In 1859, he was elected Lyceum President, and graduated with an A.B. degree.[3]/nHe then followed the family tradition of attending theological school at Williams College (1859) and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1859 to 1861. While there, he read Darwin's On the Origin of Species. He  then collected shells in Panama and Japan.[4]/nOn August 22, 1864, Gulick was ordained as a missionary in China, but also continued his study of snails. On September 3, 1864, he married Emily de la Cour.[5] In 1872, he wrote \"On the Variation of Species as Related to Their Geographical Distribution, Illustrated by the Achatinellinae\", which was published in the journal Nature. In 1872, he traveled to England for two years.[4] While there, he corresponded with Charles Darwin regarding his studies. He finally met Darwin and gave him a synopsis of an upcoming paper.[6] That paper was \"On Diversity of Evolution Under One Set of External Conditions\", which was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology in 1873. Gulick then returned to China, and remained there until 1875.[4]/nAfter his first wife died in 1875, he moved to Japan to continue missionary work.

He came to this theory while noting that there was a large diversity of local populations of Hawaiian land snails (Achatinella) which showed random variation under seemingly identical environmental conditions. Although he certainly promoted the importance of random factors in evolution, he also was a strong supporter of Darwinian natural selection, and this led to disagreement with Moritz Wagner's \"Migration Theory\" of the origin of species.[9]/nIn 1888, Gulick introduced new terms for two patterns of evolution that can be observed: the term monotypic evolution (previously called \"transformation;\" today \"anagenesis\") and the term \"polytypic evolution\" (previously called \"diversification\"; today \"cladogenesis\") \u2013 simultaneous processes, such as the multiplication of species, manifested by different populations and incipient species. George Romanes later adopted this terminology during his evolutionary studies.[9]/nGulick later proposed general geographic models of speciation, and disputed Moritz Wagner's more extreme claims that geographic speciation was the only possible route to speciation.[12][13]/nRomanes said of Gulick:/n...to his essays on the subject I attribute a higher value than to any other work in the field of Darwinian thought since the date of Darwin's death.[7]/nGulick reported collecting 44,500 Hawaiian snails in just three years. Some were of no scientific value because he did not record where they were obtained. Of many of the species he collected, no similar species remain in the wild today. Some modern observers attribute the extinction of many endemic Hawaiian snail species to him and fellow collectors such as his schoolmate David Dwight Baldwin.[14][15]", "26568937": "Guggenheim Fellowship (2007)\nMacArthur Fellowship (2009)/nUniversity of Kansas/nRichard O.

He received his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in 1983 and completed his doctorate at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1989. He then worked at the American Museum of Natural History[5] until 1991, when he became a professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas.[6] After gradually losing his hearing throughout the early 1990s due to illness, Prum moved from primarily doing field work to conducting research on plumage pigmentation, feather evolution, and Darwin's sexual selection theory.[7] Prum was a Fulbright scholar to Brazil in 2001,[8] and he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2007[9] and a MacArthur Fellowship in 2009.[6]/nHe released The Evolution of Beauty: How Darwin's Forgotten Theory of Mate Choice Shapes the Animal World \u2013 And Us, a book on the role of beauty in natural selection, in 2017.[10] In 2021, he received the Lewis Thomas Prize for his \"exceptional writing\".[11]/nIn his book Survival of the Beautiful, David Rothenberg reflects on Prum's analysis of sexual selection in birds, considering whether female birds are exercising an aesthetic sense when they choose a mate. Rothenburg argues Prum's position, that the females' aesthetic choice is essentially arbitrary and decoupled from natural selection: anything the females begin to choose becomes what the males must have if they are to have any offspring.[a] The aesthetic aspect of sexual selection has been debated since the start of Darwinism in the nineteenth century. Prum is following Edward Bagnall Poulton, who was criticised by Alfred Russel Wallace for asserting \"female preferences based on aesthetic considerations\".[13] In Rothenberg's words, Wallace \"had no place for Darwin's love of beauty, caprice, and feminine whim\".[b] Prum, on the other hand, considers art and male sexual display to be \"coevolution of the work and its appreciation\".[c]", "26011886": "Joy K. Ward is a leading evolutionary biologist studying the impact of the environment on plants and ecosystems.[1] She began a new role as the dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at Case Western Reserve University on July 1, 2020 - leaving behind her professorship at the University of Kansas. Her research on plant life has gained her notoriety in many scientific research fields. Aside from her work in the lab, she is also a strong advocate for advancing underrepresented communities' scientific learning and careers. As part of her deanship at the University of Kansas, Ward was an important factor in increasing the number of underrepresented individuals who held faculty positions in STEM subjects. Notably, as a result of her research efforts, she was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by U.S. President Barack Obama./nWard holds three degrees - a bachelor's, master's, and PhD. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from Penn State University in 1991. Moving to Durham, she completed her master's degree in botany in 1994 at Duke. This was quickly followed by a PhD, also from Duke, in botany that was completed in 1997.[2] Since 1997, Ward has also published over 40 peer-reviewed articles./nWard's primary research interests focus on how plants adapt to changing environments and conditions. As global warming has become a prevalent issue for all, Ward has directed her research to understanding how specific species of plants react to changes in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Utilizing a holistic approach to her research, Ward is interested in understanding these changes on multiple levels - molecularly, physiologically, and evolutionary. Ward is better able to understand the long-term impacts of atmospheric changes by utilizing fossil records in her research. Understanding how plants have adapted to environmental shifts in the past is an integral part of Ward's research. With her arsenal of knowledge, Ward hopes to be able to contribute ideas and strategies for conserving and ensuring the health of earth's currently thriving ecosystems./nAs carbon dioxide levels continuously fluctuate, Ward has studied the impact this has on plants. By forming an understanding of how plants adapt, Ward hopes we might be better able to predict how they will behave in the future. This will have monumental impacts on various ecosystems throughout the world. As aforementioned, Ward has been a pioneer in utilizing fossil records in her research. Through chemical and physical analysis, this groundbreaking work enabled Ward to understand past adaptations of plant life./nin 1999, Ward examined the differences in response between C3 and C4 plants when exposed to drought in environments that were low in carbon dioxide or high in carbon dioxide. Ward and her team found evidence that C4 plants have an advantage over C3 plants when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase. Additionally, the team found evidence that C4 plants have an advantage over C3 plants when they experience frequent and severe droughts.[3] During this time, Ward also led research studies on the ways that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has affected plant species in the past and present. Ward has used her data to predict how plants and future ecosystems and biological processes will operate in the future where atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will become higher.[4]/nMany of Ward's more recent research involves her predictions about the way that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide will impact plants, ecosystems, and ecology. In 2017, Ward led a study about plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide in the past, present, and future. Ward maintains that studying plants in this manner will allow scientists to better understand and predict the evolutionary consequences that will come with the changing environment. In this study, Ward found evidence for the implications of rising carbon dioxide for integrated plant-water dynamics and drought tolerance, the carbon dioxide effects on symbiotic interactions and evolutionary feedbacks, and the change in plant mechanisms in response to elevated carbon dioxide levels.[5]/n*All positions have been uploaded from Ward's curriculum vitae[6]/n*All awards and honors\u00a0 have been uploaded from Ward's curriculum vitae[7]\n[8]", "64415997": "Maria Odette Santos Ferreira (4 June 1925\u00a0\u2013 7 October 2018) was a Portuguese professor of microbiology who played an important role in research on HIV, through the identification of the HIV-2 virus in association with the Pasteur Institute of Paris. She was also the coordinator of the Portuguese programme to fight AIDS, overseeing the \"Say no to a second-hand syringe\" project, which resulted in the collection and exchange by pharmacies of 43 million used syringes between 1993 and 2008./nFerreira was born in Lisbon, Portugal, on 4 June 1925. Her grandfather was the owner of the first pharmacy on the island of Bolama in Portuguese Guinea and her father was a civil servant there. Her uncles were also pharmacists. Ferreira moved to Bolama when she was only three months old. Back in Portugal at the age of 10, she attended the Col\u00e9gio Moderno in Lisbon.[1][2]/nAfter obtaining a bachelor's degree, Ferreira had to postpone further academic training. The pharmacy faculty at the University of Lisbon had been closed since 1932, and the only institution able to offer a Pharmacy degree was in Porto. Her father, however, would not let her go alone to Porto to study. In 1968, the pharmacy faculty reopened in Lisbon, enabling her to continue her chosen studies, graduating in pharmaceutical studies in 1970. She then became an assistant professor at the University of Lisbon, responsible for practical instruction in microbiology, bacteriology, and virology. She was soon invited to spend a three-month internship with the Pasteur Institute, leaving her husband, also a pharmacist, and two daughters behind in Lisbon to go to Paris. On completing the internship, where she had been made aware of techniques for identifying the AIDS virus, she started a doctorate on the topic of hospital infections, receiving a PhD from Paris-Sud University in 1977.[1][2][3]/nIn the 1970s, Ferreira began collaborating with the Pasteur Institute to carry out an epidemiological study of hospital infections caused by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus observed in Lisbon hospitals. Her studies led to the identification of Portuguese lysotypes that had not previously been categorised. After the Carnation Revolution (25 April 1974), in which the authoritarian Estado Novo government was overthrown, she had several different roles in the reorganization of the University of Lisbon, as a member of the Board of Directors and of the Pedagogical Council.[1][2]/nIn the 1980s, Ferreira worked continuously with the Pasteur Institute, where she developed detection techniques for the HIV-1 lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), one of the etiological agents of HIV, and made the first diagnoses of cases of AIDS in Portugal, including that of the famous Portuguese singer Ant\u00f3nio Varia\u00e7\u00f5es. In September 1985, she flew to Paris from Lisbon with test tubes of blood in her coat. She held them close to her body to keep the blood at body temperature, necessary to maintain the stability of the samples, and also to be able to pass through security without inspection.[2][4][5] The blood came from a patient from Guinea-Bissau who had been admitted to the Egas Moniz Hospital in Lisbon. It was known that people in Guinea-Bissau had AIDS but researchers could not find antibodies to HIV-1 in their blood. The research Ferreira carried out at the Pasteur Institute in the following two weeks, together with Nobel Prize winners Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier, culminated in the identification of a new type of AIDS virus, HIV-2, and paved the way for comparative studies between HIV-1 and HIV-2.[2][3][4][5]/nFrom this time all of Ferreira's scientific activity was focused on the study of the HIV/AIDS infection, in particular on the less-virulent HIV-2. Her discovery of HIV-2, its epidemiology and diagnosis, made in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute and with Jos\u00e9 Luis Champalimaud from the Egas Moniz Hospital, came to revolutionize the world of serological diagnosis and helped the Retrovirus and Associated Infections Unit (CPM-URIA) at the University of Lisbon to expand and concentrate important lines of research in the area of retroviruses. Following this discovery, Ferreira and Champalimaud were invited to become consultants to the World Health Organization's AIDS Programme.[2][3]/nFerreira became Professor of Microbiology at the University of Lisbon in 1986 and played a major role in the creation of the university's microbiology laboratory. In 1992 she was appointed coordinator of the Portuguese National Programme to fight AIDS, a position she held until 2000. Under her, the \"Say no to a second-hand syringe\" needle-exchange project was introduced, the first such programme in the world. Resulting from a partnership between the Ministry of Health and the National Association of Pharmacies, this project was developed simultaneously throughout Portugal at approximately 2,500 pharmacies. By collecting 43 million used syringes between 1993 and 2008 the programme successfully reduced the risk of intravenous transmission of HIV and other communicable diseases (Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C) to drug addicts. Other projects with significant impact were the establishment of anonymous and free screening centres, and the creation of a centre in Lisbon to provide counselling, analysis, consultation and protection for sex workers.[1][2][3][6]/nThe work of the National Programme is estimated to have saved several thousand lives.[4] Ferreira visited drug addicts and prostitutes, alerting them to the need to exchange syringes and use condoms. She protested against the \"stupidity of fear\" and did not hesitate to hug and kiss HIV-positive people, even when she was personally ostracized by people who believed that the AIDS virus was spread like influenza.[4] She promoted several home-support services coordinated by the Solidarity Project of the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa, and the construction of a residence to support AIDS patients through provision of palliative care (Resid\u00eancia Madre Teresa de Calcut\u00e1).[1][3]/nIn 1975, the French government made Ferreira a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Academiques for her role in strengthening scientific cooperation between Portugal and France, and in 1987 she was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur for her work on HIV. In Portugal, in 1988, she was made a Commander of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (Portuguese: Ordem Militar de Sant'Iago da Espada). In 2016, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education (MCTES) awarded her the Medal of Merit for her \"valuable and exceptional contribution to the development of science or scientific culture in Portugal\". The Order of Pharmacists (Ordem dos Farmac\u00eauticos) recognized her achievements by awarding her its Medal of Honour and, in 2012, its gold medal. In 2010, the Order of Pharmacists created a scientific research award, which was designated as the \"Scientific Research Prize Professor Maria Odette Santos-Ferreira\". An award that particularly pleased her was the use of her name for a conference room at the Pharmacy Faculty.[1][2][3]/nFerreira died on 7 October 2018. She donated her professional estate to the Lisbon Pharmacy Museum. An exhibition of her work was under preparation with her participation at the time of her death and was held from 21 February 2019 at the museum.[4][5]", "30337278": "Clelia Giacobini (6 February 1931 \u2013 25 September 2010) was an Italian microbiologist, and also a pioneer of microbiology applied to conservation-restoration./nClelia Giacobini was born in Rome and graduated in Pharmacy and Biology at Sapienza University; subsequently she also obtained a PhD in Herbal medicine and a certificate of Soil microbiology at the Institut Pasteur in Paris (1969)./nIn the 1950s Cesare Brandi, Director and founder of Central Institute of Restoration - ICR Rome (now Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro-ISCR\"), thought to set up a laboratory of Microbiology in the Institute.

For that reason, Clelia Giacobini could be considered a \"pioneer\" of microbiology applied to conservation science. In 1961 there were the first lab results, listing microbial types that were considered responsible for biological alterations after extensive research on the archaeological and architectural monuments in Rome (Domus Tiberiana, Domus Flavia, Domus Aurea, San Clemente, monumental fountains, etc..).[4]/nIn 1965, as a result of more investigations, a preliminary methodology was defined: 1) inspection in situ and collection of samples; 2) microscopic examination of samples in the laboratory; 3) cultural isolation of drawings; 4) identification of the organisms. In 1967 she made public the results of further studies involving the definition of the five most typical phenomena of microbial spoilage on the frescoes. In 1970 the laboratory began to develop new and more refined technical and analytical methods, represented mainly by the application of scanning electron microscope, which already allowed the immediate diagnosis of the alteration and the chance to study all microorganisms in their natural environment. Later in the seventies, the workshop arranged to review the phenomenology of alterations in the appearance of biodeterioration, deepening our understanding of nutritional and environmental factors that favor the attack of biological agents.[5]/nIn the 1980s, the genus and species of these agents were identified, thanks to the collaboration of the British expert Mark Seaward and technical and scientific staff of the laboratory. In this phase of studies there were examined Fossanova Abbey, the excavations of Ostia Antica, the Etruscan tombs of Tarquinia, the Villas of Veneto, the frescoes of Villa Farnese in Caprarola (1988), etc..

This work, along with the studies of Ledbetter and Porter[35] and Green[39] established the importance of cortical microtubules in controlling the alignment of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall.[40][41] Further work with Barry Palevitz showed that microtubules were involved in orienting the cellulose microfibrils in the walls of guard cells in a pattern of radial micellation that is necessary for stomatal function.[42] Hepler, along with the husband and wife team of Dale Callaham and Sue Lancelle, developed a method to achieve rapid freeze fixation of particularly small plant cells that showed that cortical microtubules are closely associated with one another, actin microfilaments, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane.[33][43]/nBuilding on the work of Shinya Inou\u00e9 and Andrew Bajer using polarized light microscopy,[44] Hepler used electron microscopy to elucidate the nature of the microtubule/chromosome attachments at the kinetochore as well as the arrangement of the microtubules in the phragmoplast during the development of the new cell wall, where microtubules from both sides of the phragmoplast were seen to overlap with one another in the plane of the cell plate.[45]/nHepler realized that microtubules were dynamic structures that were deployed in various locations throughout the cell, and became interested in the mechanisms involved in microtubule organization in cells that lacked a microtubule-organizing center known as the centrosome. In order to understand how microtubule-organizing centers were generated, Hepler examined the de novo formation of the blepharoplast in the spermatogenous cells of Marsilea vestita. The blepharoplast in each spermatid generates 100\u2013150 basal bodies, each of which gives rise to the 9+2 arrangement of microtubules in a cilium. During telophase of the penultimate division, flocculent material appears near clefts on the distal surfaces of the daughter nuclei. During prophase of the final division which gives rise to the spermatids, the flocculent material near each nucleus condenses to give rise to two blepharoplasts, which then separate, one going to each spermatid.[46]/nWhile Hepler was successful in identifying an aggregation of material that possessed microtubule-organizing capacity, he was not able to specify the biophysical mechanisms involved in organization. After Richard Weisenberg[47] discovered that microtubule polymerization was sensitive to calcium concentration, Hepler realized that he had already seen a close association between elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules in the mitotic apparatus and in the phragmoplast and suggested that these membranes may function in controlling the concentration of free calcium in the mitotic apparatus.[48] Along with Susan Wick and Steve Wolniak, Hepler showed that the endoplasmic reticulum contained stores of calcium and suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum may locally control the calcium concentration and thus the polymerization/depolymerization of microtubules. Subsequently,[49][50] Hepler, along with Dale Callaham, Dahong Zhang, and Patricia Wadsworth, observed calcium ion transients during mitosis[51][52] and showed that the microinjection of calcium ions into the mitotic spindle does regulate the depolymerization of microtubules and the movement of chromosomes to the poles during mitosis.[53][54][55]/nHepler identified actin microfilaments in bundles at the ectoplasm-endoplasm interface of Nitella internodal cells by showing that the bundles bound heavy meromyosin, giving the characteristic arrowhead arrangement.[56][57] The actin microfilaments had the correct polarity to be part of the actomyosin motor that provides the motive force for cytoplasmic streaming in these giant algal cells.[58]/nHepler has shown that calcium ions are a central regulator of plant growth and development[59] specifically demonstrating that calcium is important for tip growth[60][61][62] and in phytochrome.[63][64] and cytokinin[65][66][67] action./nHepler's research is currently aimed at finding the ionic and molecular components that make up the pacemaker that regulates the oscillatory growth of pollen tubes. He has shown that calcium ions and protons are essential for growth.[68] The intracellular free calcium ions exist in a gradient dropping from 3000 nM at the tip to 200 nM 20 \u03bcm from the tip [69] and the intracellular H+ gradient falls from pH 6.8 at the tip to pH 7.5 10\u201330 \u03bcm from the tip.[70] The higher concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ and H+ at the tip result from the localization of the influx of these ions at the tip. The protons are effluxed at a region on the sides of the tube that corresponds to the location of the intracellular alkaline band.[71] Energy is required for pollen tube growth[72] and an H+-ATPase may mediate the efflux.\nHepler has shown that the magnitude of the intracellular calcium and proton gradients and the extracellular fluxes of these ions oscillate with a period of 15-50 s. This period is identical to the period of oscillation in the rate of pollen tube growth, however, the intracellular calcium peak follows the growth rate peak by 1\u20134 seconds, and the extracellular calcium peak follows the growth rate peak by 11\u201315 seconds.[73]\nThe delay between the extracellular and intracellular calcium peaks indicates that calcium ions do not immediately enter the cytoplasmic pool. Hepler postulates that the extracellular influx of calcium is not governed by the plasma membrane but by changes in the ion-binding properties of the pectin within the cell wall. The pectin is secreted in its uncharged methylester form. Subsequently, a pectin methylesterase in the wall results in the de-esterification of the methyl groups that yields carboxyl residues that bind calcium and form calcium-pectate cross-bridges. This calcium binding may account for the bulk of the observed extracellular current. The intracellular calcium gradient may direct the location of secretion of cell wall components that define the direction of pollen tube growth./nThe intracellular components that contribute to pollen tube growth include the actin-mediated transfer of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles filled with methylesterified homogalacturonans and pectin methylesterase synthesized on the ER to the growing tip.[74] The secretion of the vesicles at the growing tip anticipates the increase in growth rate,[75] indicating that the turgor pressure driven intussusception of the methylesterified pectin into the cell wall at the growing tip and its subsequent demethylesterification by pectin methylesterase may relax the cell wall by robbing the load-bearing calcium pectate bonds of its Ca2+.[76] This would result in a slightly delayed yet increased growth rate. The removal of the methoxy groups in the pectins at the flanks of the apical dome unmasks their negatively charged carboxylate groups. The anionic homogalacturonans then bind Ca2+ and become stiffer as the new apical dome, which will incorporate more methylesterified pectins and pectin methylesterase, grows away from the stiffened flanks composed of calcium pectate. The external Ca2+ concentration is critical. When the external Ca2+ concentration is below 10 \u03bcM, the amount of calcium pectate is so low that the cell wall is too weak and the pollen tube bursts. When the external Ca2+ concentration is above 10 mM, the amount of calcium pectate is so high that the cell wall is too stiff and the pollen tube will not grow.", "15722777": "Ricardo Rozzi (born October 6, 1960, in Santiago) is a Chilean ecologist and philosopher who is professor at the University of North Texas and the Universidad de Magallanes (UMAG).

Salvador Luria also showed that bacterial resistance to viruses (phages) is genetically inherited./nLuria was born Salvatore Luria in Turin, Italy to an influential Italian Sephardi Jewish family. His parents were Davide and Ester (Sacerdote) Luria.[1] He attended the medical school at the  University of Turin studying with Giuseppe Levi. There, he met two other future Nobel laureates: Rita Levi-Montalcini and Renato Dulbecco. He graduated from the University of Turin in 1935 and never got a master's degree or a PhD as they were not contemplated by the Italian high educational system (which, on the other hand, was very selective). From 1936 to 1937, Luria served his required time in the Italian army as a medical officer. He then took classes in radiology at the University of Rome. Here, he was introduced to Max Delbr\u00fcck's theories on the gene as a molecule and began to formulate methods for testing genetic theory with the bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria./nIn 1938, he received a fellowship to study in the United States, where he intended to work with Delbr\u00fcck. Soon after Luria received the award, Benito Mussolini's fascist regime banned Jews from academic research fellowships. Without funding sources for work in the U.S. or Italy, Luria left his home country for Paris, France in 1938. As the Nazi German armies invaded France in 1940, Luria fled on bicycle to Marseille where he received an immigration visa to the United States./nLuria arrived in New York City on September 12, 1940, and soon changed his first and middle names. With the help of physicist Enrico Fermi, whom he knew from his time at the University of Rome, Luria received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship at Columbia University.

The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences, for example, it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance./nLuria and Latarjet in 1947 published a quantitative analysis on the effect of ultraviolet irradiation on bacteriophage multiplication during intracellular growth.[5] During the early course of infection they found an increase in bacteriophage resistance to ultraviolet irradiation  and then later a decrease.  At the time this pattern, known as the Luria-Laterjet effect, was published little was known about the central role of DNA in biology.

At MIT, he switched his research focus from phages to cell membranes and bacteriocins.[citation needed] While on sabbatical in 1963 to study at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, he found that bacteriocins impair the function of cell membranes. Returning to MIT, his lab discovered that bacteriocins achieve this impairment by forming holes in the cell membrane, allowing ions to flow through and destroy the electrochemical gradient of cells. In 1972, he became chair of The Center for Cancer Research at MIT.  The department he established included future Nobel Prize winners David Baltimore, Susumu Tonegawa, Phillip Allen Sharp and H.

Due to his political involvement, he was blacklisted from receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health for a short time in 1969./nHe was a friend of the noted linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, and communicated with the Jewish American writer Elie Wiesel through a letter, in which he criticized Israel's involvement in the Guatemalan genocide and satirically Wiesel's silence on any issue concerning Israel's alleged terrorist activities worldwide. Chomsky would later describe it as such: \"In the mid-1980s, Salvador Luria, a friend of mine who is a Nobel laureate in biology and politically active, knew about this [i.e., the genocide].

She remarked on the change of roles: \"When I had had about six weeks of bacteriology, they offered me a job to teach it![2]\" She completed a second B.S. degree at the university in 1919, majoring in chemistry and zoology, and stated that \"When the war was over, I was too deep in bacteriology to ever get out again.\"[4]/nAfter finishing her degree in Colorado in 1919, she went to Chicago during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 with a desire to enter the field of medical research. She enrolled at the University of Chicago where she would eventually complete, all with honors, a M.S. degree, a Ph.D. degree in bacteriology, and a M.D. degree.[4] Her advisor at the university suggested that she study the etiology of influenza for her thesis. Therefore, in pursuit of her degrees at the University of Chicago, she studied filterable agents (viruses), and published over a dozen papers on the topic. This work eventually earned Branham a position as instructor in the Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology.[2][6]/nIn 1927, Branham left Chicago and began working as an associate at the University of Rochester School of Medicine under Stanhope Bayne-Jones.[6] Shortly thereafter, the outbreak of meningococcus arrived in California from China. Because of this, Branham's career shifted paths, and she began working for what is now the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (then, known as the Hygienic Laboratory of the United States Public Health Service) in Bethesda, Maryland as a senior bacteriologist, in order to study meningococcus. Branham stayed at the NIH for the rest of her career. She remained in the role for over 25 years until she was promoted to the Chief of Bacterial Toxins of the Division of Biological Standards in 1955.[7][2]/nBranham married retired businessman Philip S. Matthews in 1945.[3] Matthews died four years later.[6] Branham retired from the NIH in 1958 at the age of seventy from the position of Chief of the Section on Bacterial Toxins,[8] and died November 16, 1962[3][7] after a sudden heart attack. She is buried in Oxford, Georgia in her family's plot.[6]/nBroadly, Sara Branham's research was based in the field of infectious diseases, including influenza, salmonella, shigella, diphtheria, dysentery, and psittacosis.[3][9] She studied the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae.[6] The main focus of Branham's work at the NIH, however, was meningitis. This focus was Branham responding to what was quickly becoming a health crisis: an untreatable form of meningitis had arrived in the United States and began spreading quickly. She is credited with the discovery and isolation of Neisseria meningitidis. Neisseria is a common causative organism of meningitis,[9] and its taxonomy is well characterized by Branham throughout her work. She also discovered that the infection could be treated with sulfa drugs rather than antiserums that were used at the time, but that were ineffective in treating this strain. Branham was considered an international expert on the strain of disease:[6] due to her great contributions to the knowledge about it, Neisseria catarrhalis was renamed Branhamella caterrhalis in 1970, years after Branham's death.[10] The new name was officially accepted in the 1974 edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.[10][7] Branham's studies in infectious disease were nationally known, and she came to be considered as one of the \"grand ladies of microbiology\". In a biographical article about Branham published in the Atlanta Constitution,[11] the huge impact of her work was summarized in the exclamation: \"She killed millions of killers!\"[11]/nAlongside her busy professional life, Sara Branham played an active role in the community. She is regarded as a very influential woman that inspired those who worked with her throughout her career. She gave back to her alma mater by being an active alumna and supporter, returning for reunions and serving as alumna trustee from 1936 to 1939. She was a featured speaker for several events and gave many lectures, including two in 1960 just a couple years before she died.[2] She was also active in many scientific societies. She contributed to what is now the American Society for Microbiology (then, known as the Society of American Bacteriologists).[6] She was a delegate at the First and Second International Congresses in Microbiology in 1930 (Paris) and 1936 (London).[6] She served as a diplomat on both the American Board of Pathology in the field of Clinical Microbiology and the National Board of Medical Examiners.[2] One of Branham's colleagues remarked that Branham was equally comfortable entertaining in a chiffon dress and in a lab coat. She was known to be meticulous about her home and lawn, and was an avid ornithologist and gardener.[6]/nBranham was awarded the Howard Taylor Ricketts Prize in 1924 from the University of Chicago. Wesleyan College's Alumnae Association began recognizing the distinguished achievement of their individual alumnae in 1950.[2] In the inaugural year, Branham was honored with Wesleyan College's first Distinguished Service Award in 1950. She later received a similar award from the University of Chicago Medical School Alumni Association. She was also awarded an honorary doctor of science from the University of Colorado, which would be the last of six total degrees she earned in her life.[2][1] In 1959, she was honored as the American Medical Women's Association's Medical Woman of the Year.

Ramachandran, FRS (8 October 1922 \u2013 7 April 2001)[1] was an Indian physicist who was known for his work that led to his creation of the Ramachandran plot for understanding peptide structure. He was the first to propose a triple-helical model for the structure of collagen.[1] He subsequently went on to make other major contributions in biology and physics./nRamachandran was born in the town of Ernakulam, Kingdom of Cochin, India to a Tamil Brahmin family.[2] He completed his BSc honours in Physics from St Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli in 1939.[3][4] He joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1942 in the Electrical Engineering Department. Quickly realising his interest in physics, he switched to the Department of Physics to complete his master's and doctoral thesis under the supervision of Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman. In 1942, he received a master's degree in physics from Madras University with his thesis submitted from Bangalore (he did not attend any Madras college at that time). He subsequently received his D.Sc. degree in 1947.[5] Here he mostly studied crystal physics and crystal optics. During his studies he created an X-ray focusing mirror for the X-ray microscope. The resulting field of crystal topography is used extensively in studies involving crystal growth and solid-state reactivity./nRamachandran then spent two years (1947\u20131949) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge,[1] where he earned his PhD for 'studies on X-ray diffuse scattering and its application to determination of elastic constants' under the direction of Professor William Alfred Wooster, popularly known as W.A. Wooster, a leading crystallography expert in the world./nAfter completing his PhD, he returned to the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India in 1949 as an assistant professor of physics.[4] In 1952, he moved to Madras University as professor and head of the Department of Physics where he continued his work on crystal physics.[4] His interest, however, shifted to the structure of biological macromolecules. Using X-ray diffraction Ramachandran along with Gopinath Kartha proposed and published the triple helical structure of collagen in 1954 in the journal Nature, drawing worldwide scientific attention to the \"Madras group\".[6]/nAt Madras University, Professor Ramachandran was the favourite of the famous vice-chancellor and celebrated doctor and medical scientist, Sir Arcot Laksmanaswamy Mudaliar. Wanting to tackle problems at a more fundamental level, Ramachandran decided to use this information to examine the various polypeptide conformations then known and also to develop a good 'yardstick' that could be used for examining and assessing any structure in general, but peptides in particular. The result which emerged from these calculations in 1962, \u2013 now commonly known as the Ramachandran plot \u2013 was published in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1963 and has become an essential tool in the field of protein conformation.[7] When it was first calculated, crystal structures had barely been obtained for any protein. From the mid-1960s onward, Ramachandran studied many topics relating to the conformation of peptides including types of \u03b2-turns, conformation of prolyl residues, cis-peptide units, occurrence and need for non-planarity of the peptides, NMR coupling constants, peptides containing L and D residues and many others./nHe was awarded the prestigious Jawarharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1968 for research on Protein and Polypeptide Conformation; he was one of its first recipients.[8] Ramachandran can be credited for bringing together into the one field of molecular biophysics the then disparate fields of X-ray crystallography, peptide synthesis, NMR and other optical studies, and physico-chemical experimentation. In 1970, he founded the Molecular Biophysics Unit at the Indian Institute of Science which was later known as the Centre of Advanced Study in Biophysics.[1]/nRamachandran and A.V. Lakshminarayanan developed convolution-backprojection algorithms which greatly improved the quality and practicality of results obtainable by x-ray tomography. Compared to previously used methods, their algorithms considerably reduced computer processing time for image reconstruction, as well as providing more numerically accurate images. As a result, commercial manufacturers of x-ray tomographic scanners started building systems capable of reconstructing high resolution images that were almost photographically perfect. In 1971, they published their research in PNAS.[9]/nIn 1981, Ramachandran became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[10]/nNotable awards that Ramachandran received include the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award for Physics in India (1961) and the Fellowship of the Royal Society of London. In 1999, the International Union of Crystallography honoured him with the Ewald Prize for his 'outstanding contributions to crystallography'. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize as well for his fundamental contributions in protein structure and function./nRamachandran was devastated by the death of his wife Rajalakshmi in 1998 and his health gradually deteriorated. During the last few years of his life, he suffered a stroke and was affected by Parkinson's disease.[1] Ramachandran died in 2001 at age 78./nEach year, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) awards the \"G N Ramachandran Gold Medal for Excellence in Biological Sciences & Technology\" in his memory for work in Biological Sciences & Technology.[11]", "44853654": "Katherine H.

She authored around 150 papers, many co-authored with her husband Warren Harmon Lewis. The Lewises developed a growth medium called the Locke-Lewis solution and jointly received the Gerhard Gold Medal from the Pathological Society of Philadelphia.[1][2]/nMargaret Adaline Reed was born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, on November 9, 1881, to parents Joseph C. and Martha A. (Walker) Reed. From 1897 to 1901 she attended Goucher College (then known as Woman's College of Baltimore), where she earned an A.B. After graduation she studied at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, and the Universities of Zurich, Paris, and Berlin,  but never earned a graduate degree. At Bryn Mawr and Columbia she researched regeneration in amphibians and crayfish, and assisted noted embryologist Thomas Hunt Morgan.[2][3][4]/nIn 1908, Margaret Reed researched in Berlin in Max Hartmann's lab where she performed probably the first in vitro mammalian cell culture with guinea pig bone marrow by explanting the bone marrow and placing it into a nutrient-rich agar produced by fellow lab researcher Rhoda Erdmann and incubating the sample. A few days after doing so, she found that some of the nuclei exhibited characteristics of mitosis. This discovery was revisited by Margaret Reed after she married Warren Lewis, in 1910. In their combined efforts, the Lewises found that cell proliferation with their media selection and methods seemed only to occur in tissues common to all organs, such as connective tissue and blood vessel endothelium. Since the Lewises main interest was microscopic cell structures, their objective was to create optically clear media, which led to the creation of the Locke-Lewis solution. This medium is composed of salt solutions supplemented with bouillon and dextrose. The tissue grown in this medium was prepared in a method that become known as the \u201cLewis Culture\u201d where the tissue bits were put into a hanging drop on the underside of a thin glass slip. In the Locke-Lewis solution, the more robust cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, had a tendency to migrate out of the explant and flatten, making them easy to observe under high magnifications.[5]/nLewis was among the first scientists to observe the dynamics of mitochondria in living cells. In 1915 Margaret and Warren Lewis published a comprehensive analysis[6] of the shapes and movements of mitochondria in cultured cells. Lewis's pioneering time-lapse studies included observations of mitochondrial movement toward and away from the centrosome, mitochondrial fission, and mitochondrial fusion. In the same paper, Lewis presented perhaps the first descriptions of stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy./nLewis and her husband helped develop and put into practice the first experimental systems for observing and understanding somatic cell physiology in complex organisms, which demonstrated that the behavior of these autonomous cells had a significant relationship to the development, infection, immunity, physiology and development of cancer for the organism. As a result, their work served to establish the importance of cellular behavior. As a result, this couple's greatest impact on embryology and cell biology in the twentieth century was teaching later generations of biologists the basic factors involved in tissue culture based on what they had learned from their research. The Lewises saw a place for the findings on the cell related to embryology as well, and expressed this perspective to the president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington when they wrote to him that knowing the extent of a cell's permanent individuality must be determined before it is possible to understand how they cooperate and are integrated into a tissue. This perspective is what gave Margaret and Warren Lewis their place in the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution. With so many avenues opened by cell culture to explore, Margaret Lewis and her husband diverged in their area of study, with Margaret Lewis choosing to focus on microbiological problems, which involved close observations of chick embryo intestines reacting to typhoid bacilli in the medium in which it was grown. Through the tissue culture techniques the Lewises had developed, these studies showed that infections and diseases were cellular phenomena in that infection was observed in an isolated system but the events occurred in a way that would be observed in an organism as a whole.[7] \nIn her work with chick embryos, Margaret Lewis studied connective tissue formation within the tissues as well as outside of an environment where factors involved in coagulation are present. Lewis observed that the connective tissue fibrils resulted from the cytoplasmic transformations of the cells. In her studies of explanted tissue cultures, Lewis noted that the cells choose to migrate away from the tissue sample and divide as individual cells, resulting in loss of the tissue's characteristic appearance. However, she also made the distinction that the cells do not become more embryonic like Champy and others claimed, but instead lose their differentiated appearance as a tissue. This spreading of the cells and lack of characteristic tissue form caused fibril development in many tissue cultures to be lacking; however, there were a few cultures where connective tissue fibers did develop, and their progression could be tracked.  She observed that fibrils start as delicate lines in the exoplasm and become bundles that are passed between cells. Lewis also found no evidence of vacuoles forming fibrils as was believed to be the case by other researchers.[8]/nIn 1951, Lewis isolated a spontaneous epidermoid carcinoma in a mouse lung, which became known as a Lewis lung carcinoma. This carcinoma was one of the earliest tumors that could be transplanted and used to determine if a compound had potential as an anticancer agent.[9] It has played a significant role in more recent tumor models used in metastatic and angiogenesis studies as it is a highly malignant carcinoma, producing tumors when it was transplanted and increasing metastatic growth after the subcutaneously implanted carcinoma is removed.[10]\nSome of Margaret Reed Lewis\u2019 research in the mechanics of cancer included myeloid infiltration and strangulation-induced atrophy of tumors in rats.[11][12] In her study on myeloid infiltration, Lewis found that this phenomenon occurred in the adrenals but was not common to all subjects tested with tumors. However, tumor growth seemed to be associated with the progression of neutrophilia in peripheral blood and myeloid hyperplasia in certain organs.[11] In the tumor atrophy paper, Margaret Lewis showed that tumor tissue inactivated in environments devoid of sufficient circulation and continued to stay in this arrested state when transplanted to other rats. This led to absorption and resistance to viable tumor implantation.[12]/nBetween 1901 and 1912, Lewis held several teaching positions. She was an assistant in zoology at Bryn Mawr College (1901\u20131902); a science teacher at Miss Chapin's School, lecturer in physiology at New York Medical College for Women (1904\u20131907); lecturer at Barnard College (1907\u20131909), and instructor of anatomy and physiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Training School for Nurses (1911\u20131912).[2]/nIn 1910 she married Warren Harmon Lewis, also a cell physiologist. The Lewises collaborated on many research projects over the years, including the discovery that macrophage cells derived from monocytes and were not separate cell types.[13] Whether working on an independent or collaborative project, the couple worked alongside each other in lab and consulted with each other on their findings.[5] Their children were Margaret Nast Lewis, who became a physicist, Warren R.

Takahashi is a Japanese American neurobiologist and geneticist. Takahashi is a professor at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center as well as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[1][2] Takahashi's research group discovered the genetic basis for the mammalian circadian clock in 1994 and identified the Clock gene in 1997.[3][4][5] Takahashi was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2003.[6]/nTakahashi graduated from Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland in 1970.[2] Takahashi attended Swarthmore College and graduated with a degree in biology in 1974.[6] He worked with Patricia DeCoursey at the University of South Carolina for a year after graduation and then applied to work with Michael Menaker at the University of Texas, Austin. Menaker ultimately moved to the University of Oregon where Takahashi received his neuroscience Ph.D. in 1981.[6] Takahashi was a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health for two years under Martin Zatz before assuming a faculty position in Northwestern University's Department of Neurobiology and Physiology in 1983, where he held a 26-year tenure.[6] Takahashi joined the faculty at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in 2008 as their Loyd B. Sands Distinguished Chair in Neuroscience.[1] Takahashi also serves as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Hypnion Inc., a company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for central nervous system disorders affecting sleep and wake-alertness, as well as circadian rhythm abnormalities.[7] He also serves as a member of the editorial boards of Neuron, Physiological Genomics and Journal of Biological Rhythms.[8]/nIn the early 1980s, Takahashi and Menaker studied the bird pineal gland culture system in vitro to understand circadian oscillations, and they demonstrated that the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus,[9] which had been identified as the control center for circadian rhythms in mammals, played the same role in birds.[10] The authors also collaborated with DeCoursey and used hamsters to demonstrate that the photoreceptor system responsible for entrainment of circadian rhythms is different from that of the visual system.[11]/nIn 2010 Takahashi, Buhr, and Yoo examined the potential of temperature fluctuations to entrain biological oscillators. The finding that the master circadian pacemaker, a robust oscillator which is typically only entrained by environmental light/dark cycles, was also capable of entraining to temperature fluctuations when isolated in vitro indicates that temperature resetting is a fundamental property of all mammalian clocks and likely works through a highly conserved mechanism in all mammalian cells.  This also suggests that body temperature rhythms, as controlled by the SCN in homeothermic mammals, is a potential mechanism through which the master clock may synchronize circadian oscillators within tissues throughout the body.[12]/nTakahashi's research has led to many developments in understanding how the circadian clock of mammals affects physiology and relationships with the environment. In 1993, Takahashi and Michael Greenberg studied the mechanisms of mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei entrainment to environmental light cycles. They explored the relationship between phosphorylated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) and c-fos transcription, a protein previously indicated as a component of the photic entrainment pathway.[13] Using immunoprecipitation, Takahashi and Greenberg were able to show that light induced CREB phosphorylation occurs only during the subjective night.[14] Given that CREB has been shown to regulate c-fos transcription in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells,[15] Takahashi and Greenberg were able to conclude that phosphorylation of CREB in the SCN may play an important role in mammalian photic entrainment.[14]/nAfter the in vitro research on the pineal gland culture system used to understand circadian oscillations, the limitations of the cell culture system were evident and Takahashi switched methods to begin using forward genetics and positional cloning\u2014tools which required no advanced knowledge of the underlying mechanism\u2014to understand the genetic and molecular bases of circadian rhythms.[6][16] Using mutated mouse strains, Takahashi and his colleagues isolated strains with abnormal period length and discovered the clock gene in 1994.[17] They cloned the mammalian circadian clock gene in 1997.[6][18]/nIn 2000, Takahashi made what he calls one of his most significant contributions to the field, which was the cloning of the mutant tau gene identified in 1988 by Menaker and Martin Ralph.[6] Since its discovery in 1988, the tau gene had been studied thoroughly, however, due to limited genomic resources in hamsters, the organism in which it was discovered, a problem existed preventing further study. Through the use of a genetically directed representational difference analysis (GDRDA), the fragments of DNA that differed between the mutant and wild type hamsters. With this information, Takahashi then used positional syntenic cloning to identify synteny with the human genome. This revealed that the gene is closely related to the gene doubletime (dbt) in Drosophila, and casein kinase 1 epsilon (CKIe) in humans, both of which interact with and regulate PER levels.[19]/nSince identifying the clock mutant in 1994,[17] Takahashi has continued his research on this mutation and has applied it to studying clinical disorders, such as irregular sleep homeostasis and obesity.[20][21]/nIn 2000, he and his colleagues at Northwestern recognized that clock mutant mice slept 1 to 2 hours less per night than wild type mice.[20]  Additionally, because these mice lack the circadian system that regulates consolidated sleep at a certain time of day, sleep in clock mutants is spread out throughout the day in both light-dark cycles and in complete darkness.[20]  This mutation results in less REM sleep and more time spent in earlier sleep phases.[20]/nIn 2005, he collaborated with Joseph Bass and reported the effects of mutations in the clock gene on the metabolism and physiology of mice. Their experiments compared weight gain in Clock mutant mice to that of control mice and showed that mutant mice were more likely to gain weight. Such a discovery influenced them to pursue exploration of the clock gene's role in appetite and energy. In Clock mutant mice, they reported depressed levels of orexin, a neuropeptide involved in regulation of eating. This result provides further evidence that the clock gene has a profound impact on metabolic processes in mice.[21]/nIt has since been discovered that metabolism itself plays a role in regulating the clock.[22]  In 2009, Joseph Bass in collaboration with Takahashi's group discovered that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) mediated synthesis of metabolic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which both oscillate on a daily cycle, may play an important role in regulating circadian activity.[22] By measuring the oscillations of NAMPT and NAD+ levels in the livers of both wild-type and mutant mice they determined that oscillations in NAMPT regulated NAD+ which in turn regulated the deacetylase SIRT1.[22]/nUsing mutagenesis screens (forward genetics) found both the clock mutant mouse[18] and the tau mutant hamster.[6]  Takahashi's lab has continued use of this method in order to lead to discoveries of the role of the circadian clock in vision, learning, memory, stress, and addiction, among other behavioral properties.[6][2]/nIn 2007, Takahashi and his colleagues at Northwestern ran a forward mutagenesis screen in mice looking for variations in circadian oscillations and subsequently identified a mutant which they named overtime (Ovtm).[23] Using positional cloning, genetic complementation, and in-situ hybridization Takahashi and colleagues discovered that Ovtm was a point mutation that caused a loss of function in FBXL3 \u2013 an F-box protein \u2013 and was expressed throughout the brain and in the SCN. Assaying expression of known circadian clock genes in the Ovtm mutants, they observed a marked decrease in PER1 and PER2 protein and mRNA levels in the brain and a significant decrease in cry2 mRNA levels only.[23] Takahashi and his colleagues proposed that FBXL3 is a target site for protein degradation on the CRY2 protein, which would explain relatively normal CRY2 protein levels. Negative feedback by other elements of the circadian clock could then lead to the roughly 26-hour free-running period observed in Ovtm mice.[23]", "35645927": "Giovanni Rasori (1766\u20131837) was an Italian academic, physician and translator.[1]/nRasori was born in Parma.

Despite being told by her headmistress that pursuing an education in a male-dominated field of study would be foolish, in addition to contracting a serious case of mumps that temporarily stalled her academic activity, she decided to continue forth with her education.[5] In 1960, she graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in Zoology. For the next year, she studied genetics under Conrad Waddington and later devised a dissertation to study isolated populations of fish. This project was put on hold when she accepted a biology teaching job at the University of British Columbia,[5] where she met Peter Grant.[6]/nPeter Raymond Grant was born in 1936 in London, but relocated to the English countryside to avoid encroaching bombings during World War II. He attended school at the Surrey-Hampshire border, where he collected botanical samples, as well as insects.[6] He attended the University of Cambridge and later moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began work on a doctoral degree in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. Peter met Rosemary after beginning his research there, and after a year, the two wedded.[6]/nFor his doctoral degree, Peter Grant studied the relationship between ecology and evolution and how they were interrelated. The Grants travelled to the Tres Marias Islands off Mexico to conduct field studies of the birds that inhabited the island.[6] They compared the differences of bill length to body size between populations living on the Islands and the nearby mainland. Of the birds studied, eleven species were not significantly different between the mainland and the islands; four species were significantly less variable on the islands, and one species was significantly more variable.[7] On average, the birds on the islands had larger beaks. The Grants attributed these differences to what foods were available, and what was available was dependent on competitors. The bigger beaks indicated a greater range of foods present in the environment.[6]/nIn 1965, Peter Grant accepted tenure at McGill University in Montreal. He created a method to test the Competition Hypothesis to see if it worked today as it did in the past.[6] This research was done on grassland voles and woodland mice. The study looked at the competitiveness between populations of rodents and among rodent species.[8] In his article \"Interspecific Competition Among Rodents\", he concluded that competitive interaction for space is common among many rodent species, not just the species that have been studied in detail.[8] Grant also states that there are many causes for increased competition: reproduction, resources, amount of space, and invasion of other species.[8]/nDaphne Major, in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, was a perfect place to perform experiments and study changes within birds. It was isolated and uninhabited; any changes that were to occur to the land and environment would be due to natural forces with no human destruction.[9] The island provided the best environment to study natural selection; seasons of heavy rain switched to seasons of extended drought. With these environmental changes brought changes in the types of foods available to the birds. The Grants would study this for the next few decades of their lives./nIn 1973, the Grants headed out on what they thought would be a two-year study on the island of Daphne Major. There they would study evolution and ultimately determine what drives the formation of new species.[9] There are thirteen species of finch that live on the island; five of these are tree finch, one warbler finch, one vegetarian finch, and six species of ground finch. These birds provide a great way to study adaptive radiation. Their beaks are specific to the type of diet they eat, which in turn is reflective of the food available. The finches are easy to catch and provide a good animal to study. The Grants tagged, labelled, measured, and took blood samples of the birds they were studying. The two-year study continued through 2012.[9]/nDuring the rainy season of 1977 only 24 millimetres of rain fell. Two of the main finch species were hit exceptionally hard and many of them died.[10] The lack of rain caused major food sources to become scarce, causing the need to find alternative food sources. The smaller, softer seeds ran out, leaving only the larger, tougher seeds. The finch species with smaller beaks struggled to find alternate seeds to eat.[10] The following two years suggested that natural selection could happen very rapidly. Because the smaller finch species could not eat the large seeds, they died off. Finches with larger beaks were able to eat the seeds and reproduce. The population in the years following the drought in 1977 had \"measurably larger\" beaks than had the previous birds./nIn 1981, the Grants came across a bird they had never seen before. It was heavier than the other ground finches by more than five grams.[11][12]\n[13] They called this bird Big Bird. It had many different characteristics than those of the native finches: a strange call, extra glossy feathers, it could eat both large and small seeds, and could also eat the nectar, pollen, and seeds of the cacti that grow on the island.[9]  Although hybrids do happen, many of the birds living on the island tend to stick within their own species.[14] Big Bird lived for thirteen years, initially interbreeding with local species.  His descendants have only mated within themselves for the past thirty years, a total of seven generations.[14]/nBig Bird was originally assumed to  be an immigrant from the island of Santa Cruz. However, in 2015, whole genome analysis linked its descent to a bird that originated on Espa\u00f1ola Island, more than 100 kilometers from Daphne Major, the Espa\u00f1ola cactus finch (G. conirostris). \nDescendants of G. conirostris and local finches (G. fortis) have become a distinct species, the first example of speciation to be directly observed by scientists in the field.[15]\nWhole genome studies have enabled scientists to trace changes in the genome as the species became distinct.  Genes for beak shape (ALX1) and beak size (HMGA2) have been determined to be crucial in separating the hybridized species from local finches. Genes relating to the finches' song may also be involved.[11][16]/nOver the course of 1982\u20131983, El Ni\u00f1o brought a steady eight months of rain. In a normal rainy season Daphne Major usually gets two months of rain.[17] The excessive rain brought a turnover in the types of vegetation growing on the island. The seeds shifted from large, hard to crack seeds to many different types of small, softer seeds. This gave birds with smaller beaks an advantage when another drought hit the following year.[17] Small-beaked finch could eat all of the small seeds faster than the larger beaked birds could get to them./nIn 2003, a drought similar in severity to the 1977 drought occurred on the island. However, in the time between the droughts (beginning in late 1982), the large ground finch (Geospiza magnirostris) had established a breeding population on the island. This species has diet overlap with the medium ground finch (G. fortis), so they are potential competitors. The 2003 drought and resulting decrease in food supply may have increased these species' competition with each other, particularly for the larger seeds in the medium ground finches' diet. Following the drought, the medium ground finch population had a decline in average beak size, in contrast to the increase in size found following the 1977 drought. This was hypothesized to be due to the presence of the large ground finch; the smaller-beaked individuals of the medium ground finch may have been able to survive better due to a lack of competition over large seeds with the large ground finch. This is an example of character displacement.[18]/nIn Evolution: Making Sense of Life, the takeaway from the Grants' 40-year study can be broken down into three major lessons. The first is that natural selection is a variable, constantly changing process. The fact that they studied the island in both times of excessive rain and drought provides a better picture of what happens to populations over time. The next lesson learned is that evolution can actually be a fairly rapid process. It does not take millions of years; these processes can be seen in as little as two years. Lastly, and as the author states, most importantly, selection can change over time. During some years, selection will favour those birds with larger beaks. Other years with substantial amounts of smaller seeds, selection will favour the birds with the smaller beaks.[19]/nIn their 2003 paper, the Grants wrap up their decades-long study by stating that selection oscillates in a direction. For this reason, neither the medium ground finch nor the cactus finch has stayed morphologically the same over the course of the experiment. The average beak and body size are not the same today for either species as they were when the study first began.[20] The Grants also state that these changes in morphology and phenotypes could not have been predicted at the beginning.[21] They were able to witness the evolution of the finch species as a result of the inconsistent and harsh environment of Daphne Major directly./nSocieties and Academies:/nHonorary Degrees/nAssociate Editor of Scientific Journals/nHonorary citizen of Puerto Bacquerizo, I.

His influential Researches into the Physical History of Mankind touched upon the subject of evolution. From 1845, Prichard served as a Medical Commissioner in Lunacy.  He also introduced the term \"senile dementia\".[1]/nPrichard was born in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. His parents Thomas and Mary Prichard were Quakers:[2] his mother was Welsh, and his father was of an English family who had emigrated to Pennsylvania . Within a few years of his birth in Ross, Prichard's parents moved to Bristol, where his father now worked in the Quaker ironworks of Harford, Partridge and Cowles. Upon his father's retirement in 1800 he returned to Ross. As a child Prichard was educated mainly at home by tutors and his father, in a range of subjects, including modern languages and general literature.[3]/nRejecting his father's wish that he should join the ironworks, Prichard decided upon a medical career. Here he faced the difficulty that as a Quaker he could not become a member of the Royal College of Physicians. Therefore, he started on apprenticeships that led to the ranks of apothecaries and surgeons, first studying under the Quaker obstetrician Dr Thomas Pole of Bristol. Apprenticeships followed to other Quaker physicians, and to St Thomas' Hospital in London. In 1805, he entered medical school at Edinburgh University, where his religious affiliation was no bar. Also, the Scottish medical schools were held in esteem, having contributed greatly to the Enlightenment of the previous century./nHe took his M.D. at Edinburgh, his doctoral thesis of 1808 being his first attempt at the great question of his life: the origin of human varieties and races.[4] Later, he read for a year at Trinity College, Cambridge,[5] after which came a significant personal event: he left the Society of Friends to join the established Church of England. He next moved to St John's College, Oxford, afterwards entering as a gentleman commoner at Trinity College, Oxford, but taking no degree in either university.[3]/nIn 1810 Prichard settled at Bristol as a physician, eventually attaining an established position at the Bristol Infirmary (BRI) in 1816. Whilst working at the BRI, Prichard lived in the Red Lodge.  This was also where he wrote Researches into the Physical History of Man.[6]/nIn 1845 he was made one of the three medical Commissioners in Lunacy, having previously been one of the Metropolitan Commissioners,[7] and moved to London. He died there three years later of rheumatic fever. At the time of his death he was president of the Ethnological Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society.[8]/nIn 1813 he published his Researches into the Physical History of Man, in two volumes, on essentially the same themes as his dissertation in 1808. The book grew until the third edition of 1836-1847 occupied five volumes. The second to the fourth editions were published under the title Researches into the Physical History of Mankind. The fourth edition was also in five volumes.[9]/nThe central conclusion of the work is the unity of the human species, which has been acted upon by causes which have since divided it into permanent varieties or races. The work is dedicated to Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, whose five races of man are adopted. Prichard differed from Blumenbach and other predecessors by the principle that people should be studied by combining all available characters./nThree British men, all medically qualified and publishing between 1813 and 1819, William Lawrence, William Charles Wells and Prichard, addressed issues relevant to human evolution. All tackled the question of variation and race in humans; all agreed that these differences were heritable, but only Wells approached the idea of natural selection as a cause./nScience historian Conway Zirkle has described Prichard as an evolutionary thinker who came very close \"to explaining the origin of new forms through the operation of natural selection although he never actually stated the proposition in so many words.\"[10]/nPrichard indicated Africa (indirectly) as the place of human origin, in this summary passage:/nThis opinion was omitted in later editions.[12] The second edition includes more developed evolutionary ideas.[13]/nPrichard was influential in the early days of ethnology and anthropology. He stated that the Celtic languages are allied by language with the Slavonian, German and Pelasgian (Greek and Latin), thus forming a fourth European branch of Indo-European languages. His treatise containing Celtic compared with Sanskrit words appeared in 1831 under the title Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations. An essay by Adolphe Pictet, which made its author's reputation, was published independently of the earlier investigations of Prichard.[14]/nIn 1843 Prichard published his Natural History of Man, in which he reiterated his belief in the specific unity of man, pointing out that the same inward and mental nature can be recognized in all the races.[15] Prichard was an early member of the Aborigines' Protection Society./nIn medicine, he specialised in what is now psychiatry. In 1822 he published A Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System[16] (pt. I), and in 1835 a Treatise on Insanity and Other Disorders Affecting the Mind, in which he advanced the theory of the existence of a distinct mental illness called moral insanity. Prichard's work was also the first definition of senile dementia in the English language.[1] Augstein has suggested that these works were aimed at the prevalent materialist theories of mind, phrenology and craniology.[17] She has also suggested that Prichard was influenced by the somatic school of German Romantic psychiatric thought, in particular Christian Friedrich Nasse, and (eclectically) Johann Christian August Heinroth; this in addition to an acknowledged debt to Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol.[18]/nIn 1842, following up on moral insanity, he published On the Different Forms of Insanity in Relation to Jurisprudence, designed for the use of persons concerned in legal questions regarding unsoundness of mind.[19]/nAmong his other works were:/nHe married Anne Maria Estlin, daughter of John Prior Estlin and sister of John Bishop Estlin.[20] They had ten children,[21] eight of whom survived infancy, including Augustin Prichard (b. 1818, d. 1898), Constantine Estlin Prichard (b.1820), Theodore Joseph Prichard (b.1821), Illtiodus Thomas Prichard (b. 1825), Edith Prichard (b. 1829) and Albert Herman Prichard (b.1831).[22]/nDocuments including medical certificates relating to James Cowles Prichard and his second son, Augustin Prichard, are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 16082) (online catalogue).

He predicted the discovery of the Hepatitis B chronic carrier state would lead to calls for exclusion and quarantine of chronic carriers and the denial of health care. Blumberg came down solidly on the side of liberty and stated it was better not to test for the condition in medical practice. The following year, the teacher's union in New York City moved to exclude chronic carriers from the New York school system. At the time, a number of developmentally disabled children who had been institutionalized at Willowbrook were being mainstreamed into the public schools. As part of the Willowbrook hepatitis experiments, most children had been involuntarily tested and over 50 chronic carriers had been identified. The New York Public Health department convened a panel to decide policy led by Saul Krugman; however, Blumberg with his open views, was notably excluded. The panel and school system decided to exclude all known Hepatitis B carriers from school attendance and impose compulsory blood testing on all their classmates without informed consent about the nature of the blood tests. Litigation on behalf of the excluded children reversed the policy, and Blumberg advised the excluded children's lawyers. This set important precedent for the AIDS era./nIn an interview with The New York Times in 2002 he stated that \"[Saving lives] is what drew me to medicine. There is, in Jewish thought, this idea that if you save a single life, you save the whole world\".[28]/nBlumberg died on April 5, 2011,[1] shortly after giving the keynote speech at the International Lunar Research Park Exploratory Workshop held at NASA Ames Research Center.[29][30] At the time of his death Blumberg was a distinguished scientist at the NASA Lunar Science Institute, located at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.[31][32]/nJonathan Chernoff, the scientific director at the Fox Chase Cancer Center where Blumberg spent most of his working life said, \"I think it's fair to say that Barry prevented more cancer deaths than any person who's ever lived.\"[33] In reference to Blumberg's discovery of the Hepatitis B vaccine, former NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said, \"Our planet is an improved place as a result of Barry's few short days in residence.\"[34][35][36]/nIn 2011, the Library of Congress and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced the establishment of the Baruch S.

She pioneered both molecular weight determination of proteins using SDS PAGE[6] and immunofluorescence microscopy.[7] Osborn also used the immunofluorescence microscopy method to work out the details of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.  Small differences in the intermediate filament constituents helped her distinguish differentiated cells from each other.[8] She also found intermediate filament immunofluorescence differences between normal versus cancer cells.[8] Mary Osborn has been a prominent spokesperson for women in science.[9]/nOsborn was born in Darlington, UK[4] on December 16, 1940.[4] Osborn completed high school education at Cheltenham Ladies' College and university education at  Newnham College, Cambridge University where she was graduated in Mathematics and Physics in 1962.[4] She received a masters in biophysics at Pennsylvania State University in 1963. Her PhD on mutagenesis in nonsense mutations in bacteria was awarded by Pennsylvania State University in 1972.[5]/nMary Osborn carried out postdoctoral research from 1967 to 1969 in the laboratory of James Watson at Harvard University.[5]  Then she conducted research at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK (1969\u201372) before moving to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1972-75.)[4] Osborn had married her husband, Klaus Weber, on July 14, 1972.[4] Weber and Osborn moved to the G\u00f6ttingen Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry where Weber was Director and Osborn received a staff appointment in 1975.[4] in 1989, she was appointed an honorary professor at University of G\u00f6ttingen,.[5]/nMary Osborn and Klaus Weber wrote a classic paper in biochemistry [10] on determination of the molecular weight of a protein via SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, published in 1969 in Journal of Biological Chemistry.[4] They knew that in 1967 Shapiro, Vinuela, and Maisel had shown that electrophoresis of proteins along with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) could separate the tested polypeptide chains by molecular weight.[6][11] To see if this method applied to proteins of various sizes and shapes, Osborn and Weber took 40 known proteins, including globular and filamentous proteins, analyzed them via SDS PAGE, and plotted the logarithms of their molecular weights against their electrophoretic mobilities.[6] The results showed convincingly that \"the good resolution and the fact that an estimate of the molecular weight can be obtained within a day, together with the small amount of protein needed, makes the method strongly competitive with others commonly employed.\"[6]  This method has been used extensively by biochemists in all kinds of studies involving protein purification and identification as part of the process.[10]/nLater, Osborn and Weber pioneered fluorescent antibody staining of cellular substructures, a major technique called indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.[9] In developing the method, they tagged microtubules with specific antibodies, then used fluorescently-tagged secondary antibodies (antibodies to the first set of antibodies) to light up the locations of the microtubules in cells.[10] When they began their work in Germany, the cytoskeleton was not heavily researched.  Microtubules and microfilaments were known, and they established that microtubules always reacted with antibodies to tubulins while microfilaments always reacted with antibodies to actin. In the course of their studies, they also found intermediate filaments, slightly thicker than microfilaments, and unreactive to actin antibodies.[7][8]/nThey developed new antibodies against proteins of the microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments to use as reagents in examining many types of cells.[8] Many of their antibodies have been licensed to companies for commercial development.[8] Klaus and Osborn used their method to study elements of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells in two dimensions and three dimensions.[8]  Osborn has extensively studied microtubules, intermediate filaments, microfilaments, and nuclear proteins as well as other proteins that can associate with these structures.  By 1981 Osborn and Klaus had shown conclusively intermediate filaments in different types of cells are different but related, and they can be distinguished using immunofluorescence.[8] Soon thereafter, in 1982, the laboratory showed that many tumors differ from their matching normal tissue in the protein details of intermediate filaments as shown by immunofluorescence.[8][12] They also found that intermediate filament composition was tumor-specific.[8][12] Osborn and Weber have pioneered the diagnostic classification of tumor types using specific cytoskeletal elements determined via immunofluorescence microscopy.  Their methods have been widely applied in numerous clinical studies of muscular dystrophy and cancer.[9]/nWhen Mary Osborn returned to Europe after years in the US, she was surprised to find that European science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields) had not opened doors to women as she had experienced in America. She was quoted in an article in Science in 1994 to the effect that women's role in Germany was still \"kinder, kuche, kirch\" (children, kitchen, church.)[9]  In 1992, she had written a protest letter in response to an editorial in Nature that had claimed child care issues were chiefly responsible for the leaky pipeline for women in science, not discrimination.[9][10]  As a woman without children who had experienced no gender discrimination early in her career but had seen differential treatment of men and women in science later, she did not find this argument convincing, and she was appalled to find out that Europe had collected little or no data on rates of success of women in science.  Partly because Osborn objected to this situation, the European Commission (EC) appointed her co-chair of a working group to investigate the status of European women scientists and scientists in training and in employment and to prepare a report.[9]  The outcome was  the European Technology Assessment Network (ETAN) Report on Women in Science, published in 2006, which identified a number of reasons why women dropped out of science and served as a blueprint for Europeans who wished to fix this problem.[9][10]/nShe noted in 2012 that there was still a leaky pipeline for women scientists in Germany.[8] She has given a great deal of thought to how women are taught to act as they grow up and how that may impact their career decisions.  In an interview in 2004, Osborn said, \"In deciding whether to accept new challenges a remark by Diane Britten some years ago in The Times has proved very helpful: \"When asked to do something women tend to say `Why me?' Men say `Why not me?' I have learned to say `Why not me?'''[4] Summing up her advice to those in charge of sciences in universities and industry, she said in 2012, \"Above all one has to get the argument across that it is wasteful, expensive and unfair to educate and train large numbers of female scientists and then not use their talents in the job market or provide equal access to the top jobs.\"[8]", "69855804": "Michael Maurice[1] Goodin (April 8, 1967 \u2013 December 12, 2020) was a Jamaican-born plant virologist.

In 1935 his family moved to Georgia Cottage in Mobile. He graduated from Murphy High School in Mobile in the spring of 1942.

Burgin and Private First Class Merriell \"Snafu\" Shelton.[4] He rose to the rank of corporal in the Pacific Theater and saw combat as a 60\u00a0mm mortarman[5] at Peleliu and Okinawa. When fighting grew too close for effective use of the mortar, he served in other duties such as stretcher bearer[5] and as a rifleman.[6]/nDuring his service, Sledge kept notes of what happened in his pocket-sized New Testament. When the war ended, he compiled these notes which would, many years later, become the  memoir With the Old Breed. After being posted to Beijing after the war,[7] he was discharged from the Marine Corps in February 1946 with the rank of corporal.[8]/nAfter the war ended, Sledge attended Auburn University (then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute),[9] where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[10] He received a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration in the summer of 1949.[11]/nSledge had a hard time readjusting to civilian life:/nAs I strolled the streets of Mobile, civilian life seemed so strange.

He found that he could not endure the thought of wounding a bird and said that killing a deer felt like shooting a cow in a pasture. His father found him weeping after a dove hunt in which Sledge had to kill a wounded dove, and in the ensuing conversations he told his father he could no longer tolerate seeing any suffering. A key turning point in his life and career followed when his father advised him that he could substitute bird watching as a hobby. Sledge started to assist the conservation department in its banding study efforts,[13] the origin of his well-known passion for the science of ornithology.[citation needed]/nWhen he enrolled at Auburn University, the clerk at the Registrar's office asked him if the Marine Corps had taught him anything useful. Sledge replied:/nLady, there was a killing war. The Marine Corps taught me how to kill Japs and try to survive. Now, if that don't fit into any academic course, I'm sorry.

Vogt joined the British Pharmacological Society and began work with Sir Henry Dale at the National Institute for Medical Research, London.  Vogt coauthored a paper with Dale and Wilhelm Feldberg: 'Release of Acetylcholine at Voluntary Motor Nerve Endings' in 1936.[7] Sir Henry Dale was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1936 based on the work described in this paper, and he credited Feldberg and Vogt in his lecture.[8]/nIn late 1935, for the second half of her Rockefeller Traveling Fellowship, Marthe Vogt began work in Cambridge on the relationship of blood pressure to substances from the ischaemic kidney with Professor E.B. Varney, with additional funding grants from the Royal Society.  She was also awarded the Alfred Yarrow Research Fellowship of Girton College the next year.  In 1938 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Cambridge, where she was a demonstrator in pharmacology and physiology./nUnfortunately, the politics of World War II threatened her career.  Her German nationality led to an investigation by British intelligence services in 1940, who categorized her as a category A enemy alien because Nazi officials would not accept her resignation from a permanent appointment when she left Germany.  She was brought before a tribunal which ruled for her immediate internment.  However, Vogt's colleagues and friends rallied to her aid and an appeal was granted, freeing her to continue her work at Cambridge.[2]/nVogt remained at Cambridge for five years, working on topics in hypertension and adrenal gland function. In 1947, Vogt became a lecturer and later reader in pharmacology at Edinburgh University, where she continued work on transmitter substances, publishing research on serotonin and reserpine. In 1948, Vogt published a seminal work with William Feldberg: \"Acetylcholine synthesis in different regions of the central nervous system\".  The paper provides the earliest evidence for the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter and demonstrated the regional distribution of cholinergic systems in the brain./nShe was a visiting professor at Columbia University, New York in 1949.  Over the next thirty years, Vogt would divide her time between Cambridge, London and Edinburgh, and in 1960 she moved back to Cambridge once more to head the Pharmacology Unit at the Babraham Institute, retiring in 1968. She continued research there until 1990./nThroughout her life Marthe Vogt received numerous accolades from many scientific institutions. In 1952 she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1981 she was awarded the Royal Medal of the Society. She also held honorary doctorates from Edinburgh and Cambridge. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[9]/nMarthe Vogt later relocated to La Jolla, California in 1988 to live with her sister, noted cancer biologist  Marguerite Vogt (1913-2007).

His father, Robert Clark Orr, was a quarry owner, and a man of deep religious convictions, being a member of the Free Church of Scotland. His mother, Annie Boyd, was the daughter of another quarry master, wealthier than Robert Orr, and Past Master of a Masonic lodge./nHe was taught to read at an early age by his widowed grandmother, who lived with the family.[9] The family home was well supplied with books, and his father was widely read in political, sociological and metaphysical subjects, as well as religion. As he grew older, John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father, brothers, and visiting friends.[9]/nWhen he was five years old, the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea. They had to sell their home in Kilmaurs, and moved to West Kilbride, a village on the North Ayrshire coast. According to Kay, the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs, despite the family's reduced means. The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride. Apart from a four-month break at age thirteen, he attended the village school until age nineteen, the last four years as a pupil-teacher. Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland, and the school gave him a good knowledge of the Bible, which stayed with him for the rest of his life.[10]/nAt the age of thirteen, Boyd Orr won a bursary to Kilmarnock Academy, a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare. The new school was some 20 miles (32\u00a0km) from his home in West Kilbride, but his father owned a quarry about two miles (3\u00a0km) from the academy, and John was provided with accommodation nearby. His family cut short his education at the academy because, at the expense of his school attendance, he was spending time with the quarry workers, who let him work the machinery, and from whom he picked up a \"wonderful vocabulary of swear words\".[10] After four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G. Lyons.[10] There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of \u00a310 for the first year, and \u00a320 for the second. This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr, as in addition to his teaching duties, and studying at home for his university entrance and teacher-training qualifications, he also had to work every day in his father's business.[10]/nAfter four years as a pupil-teacher, at the age of 19, he won a Queen's Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in Glasgow, plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there. The course required attending classes at the college, in addition to following the three-year Arts course \u2013 based on classics \u2013 at the university. As Boyd Orr had passed his university entrance examinations, the fees for the university were also covered. The university education was considered the more important part of the course.[11]/nBoyd Orr criticised the university course because the hard work required to pass the exams did not allow sufficient time to meet and discuss with students of different social backgrounds.[a]/nAs an undergraduate in Glasgow, he explored the interior of the city, usually at weekends. He was shocked by what he found in the poverty-stricken slums and tenements, which then made up a large part of the city. Rickets was obvious among the children, malnutrition (in some cases, associated with drunkenness) was shown by many of the adults, and many of the aged were destitute. In his first teaching job after graduating M.A. in 1902, he was posted to a school in the slums. His first class was overcrowded, and the children ill-fed or actually hungry, inadequately clothed, visibly lousy and physically wretched. He resigned after a few days, realising that he could not teach children in such a condition, and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery.[12]/nAfter working for a few months in his father's business, he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in Saltcoats, also a poor area, but less squalid than the slums of Glasgow. Boyd Orr needed to augment his teacher's salary, and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in book-keeping and accountancy. After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations, and duly instructed his class. The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for, and teaching, this class were to prove very useful in his later career./nBoyd Orr realised that his heart was not in teaching, and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queen's Scholarship, he returned to the university to study biology, a subject he had always been interested in since childhood. As a precaution, he entered simultaneously for a degree in medicine./nHe found the university to be a very stimulating environment. Diarmid Noel Paton (son of the artist Joseph Noel Paton) was Regius Professor of Physiology, and Edward Provan Cathcart head of Physiological Chemistry, both men of outstanding scientific ability. He was impressed by Samson Gemmell, Professor of Clinical Medicine,[13] a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orr's approach to such questions.[12]/nHalf-way through his medical studies, his savings ran out. Reluctant to ask his family for support, he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage, with the help of a bank overdraft, and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies. On graduating, he sold the property for a small profit./nHe graduated BSc in 1910, and M.B. Ch.B. in 1912, at the age of 32, placing sixth in a year of 200 students. Two years later, in 1914, he graduated M.D. with honours, receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year./nOn leaving the university, he took a position as a ship's surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa, choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other. He resigned after four months, when he had repaid the debt. He then tried general practice, working as a locum in the practice of his family doctor in Saltcoats, and was offered a partnership there. Realising that a career in medicine was not for him, he instead accepted the offer of a two-year Carnegie research scholarship, to work in E. P. Cathcart's laboratory. The work he began there covered malnutrition, protein[14] and creatine[15][16] metabolism, the effect of water intake on nitrogenous metabolism in humans,[17][18] and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training.[19]/nOn 1 April 1914, Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in Aberdeen, a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the North of Scotland College of Agriculture and Aberdeen University. He had been offered the post on the recommendation of E. P. Cathcart, who had originally been offered the job, but had turned it down in favour of a chair in physiology in London./nThe joint committee had allocated a budget of \u00a35,000 for capital expenditure and \u00a31,500 for annual running costs. Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate. Using his experience in his father's business of drawing up plans and estimating costs, he submitted a budget of \u00a350,000 for capital expenditure and \u00a35,000 for annual running costs. Meanwhile, with the \u00a35,000 he had already been allocated he specified a building, not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee, but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed \u00a350,000 Institute. He accepted the lowest tender of \u00a35,030, and told the contractors to begin work immediately. The committee were not pleased, but had to accept the fait accompli. When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof, but to do no more for the time being./nOn the outbreak of the First World War he was given leave to join the British Army, and asked his former colleague E. P. Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas. Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home, and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the R.A.M.C. dealing with sanitation. Several divisions of non-conscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home, some of them in very poor sanitary conditions. Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene, preventing much sickness.[20]/nAfter 18 months he was posted as Medical Officer to an infantry unit, the 1st battalion Sherwood Foresters. He spent much of his time in shell holes, patching up the many wounded. His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a Military Cross after the Battle of the Somme, and of the Distinguished Service Order after Passchendaele. He also made arrangements for the battalion's diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields. As a result, unlike other units, he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital. He also prevented his men getting trench foot by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual.[20]/nWorried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances, he asked to be transferred to the navy, where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research. The army was reluctant to let him go, but agreed, since he was still a civilian surgeon. He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at Chatham, studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards, before being posted to HMS Furious. On board ship his medical duties were light, enabling him to do a great deal of reading. He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army./nWhen Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in Cambridge, Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter's support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to \u00a34,000. In 1920 he was introduced to John Quiller Rowett, a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience[21] over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr's plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide \u00a310,000 for the first year, \u00a310,000 for the second year, and gave an additional \u00a32,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, \"if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work\",[22] a condition the Treasury was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed Rowett Research Institute was opened shortly thereafter by Queen Mary.[23]/nBoyd Orr proved to be an effective fund-raiser from both government and private sources,[24] expanding the experimental farm to around 1,000 acres (4.0\u00a0km2), building a well-endowed library, and expanding the buildings. He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the institute's growing reputation, a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orr's many publications.[2] His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fund-raising, and in later life he said, \"I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute.\"[23]/nThrough the 1920s, his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition, his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving people's diets.

Her research focuses on circadian oscillators and their control of gene expression in living cells. Currently, Loros is a professor of Biochemistry, Cell Biology, and Molecular and Systems Biology at the Giesel School of Medicine.[1]/nLoros is from Los Altos, California. She attended Homestead High School and graduated in 1968. Loros then attended both Cabrillo College and Monterey Peninsula College and received two associate degrees in Biology by 1971.[2]/nBy 1979, Loros received her bachelor's degree in Biology from UC Santa Cruz. She went on to complete her PhD in Genetics from Dartmouth Medical School.[1]/nIn 1988, Loros began her career in biology at Dartmouth Medical School as a postdoctoral researcher in Biochemistry.[2] By 1994, Loros earned the position of Research Associate Professor of Biochemistry[2] and then accepted the position of Associate Professor of Biochemistry in 1996. She then became Professor of Biochemistry and Professor of Genetics in 2000 and 2001 respectively.[1]/nLoros also leads research at the Dunlap and Loros Laboratories with her husband Jay Dunlap, a fellow chronobiologist and researcher.[2] Her focus is on the circadian clock in Neurospora and its application to the genetic mechanisms of the clock in other organisms.[1][2] Loros, along with Jay Dunlap and Patricia J. DeCoursey, co-authored the text book \"Chronobiology: Biological Timekeeping \" which was published on June 1, 2004. The text chronicles the field of chronobiology by exploring both past and current discoveries and their relevance to modern society.[3]/nDr. Loros contributed to advancing research techniques by developing a targeted gene disruption technique for use in Neurospora, which had the effect of amplifying gene markers in such a manner as to make identification of low homologous recombination rates possible, which had previously not been the case when using traditional techniques such as Southern Blot tests.[4] Gene identification in Neurospora was additionally progressed by Loros\u2019 lab when it produced a high density SNP map for Neurospora.[4][5]/nLastly, continuing on with an idea from her post-doc work, Loros resynthesized a gene that codes for firefly luciferase.[2] Since Neurospora has long been a key model organism in the chronobiology field, modifying this tool has been key in further research. Before this, codon bias prevented effective usage of firefly luciferase in Neurospora, problematic as firefly luciferase serves as a reporter to measure transcription in cells. By modifying the firefly luciferase gene, Loros was able to achieve several orders more of light production in Neurospora, revolutionizing transcription measurements in N. cell cultures. Moreover, her modification to this reporter allowed the \u00a0FRQ/WCC feedback loop to be monitored in real time without disturbing the overt rhythms of the system. This in turn provided the tool to distinguish between oscillators not directly in the clock and the circadian clock itself.[6]/nAfter joining the faculty of the Giesel School of Medicine, Loros continued her post-doc research into the regulation of messenger RNA by circadian clocks.[7] Through sequential rounds of subtractive hybridization, Loros found 2 such genes that are responsible for transcription in morning specific cultures of Neurospora. Loros named these two, unlinked, genes ccg-1 and ccg-2, with the initialisms standing for clock-controlled genes, a term which, now prevalent in the circadian clock dialogue, Loros claims to have coined herself.[2][7] Moreover, her work on the negative feedback loop involved in the FRQ pathway demonstrated that the phosphorylation of negative elements of the clock are not as important in controlling the period as once thought. Loros and her collaborators showed that the nature of the FRQ allele controlled the pace of the clock, not the rate of phosphorylation and degradation of clock elements./nDuring her post-doc work, Loros remarked upon the possibility of frq being light induced, which was later confirmed by a post-doc fellow.[8] Turning her attention to the governing body for this light induction, Loros began experimenting with wc-1 finding that it not only was the mediator for said light induction, but was also necessary for Neurospora\u2019s clock in the absence of light.[8]/nWc-1, in conjunction with its partner protein, wc-2, was found to be the first described positive element regulator in a circadian feedback loop, with the norm being that of negative regulators. This led to the precedent of the PAS-PAS heterodimers in both animals and fungi alike.[8]/nRecently, Loros has worked on examining the reciprocal relationship between metabolism and circadian rhythm. Using Neurospora as her model organism, Loros\u2019 work has revealed how interconnected these two crucial systems are in fungi. These links include both the outputs of each system and how metabolism can directly influence the rhythms set by the clock.[9]", "3697442": "Karl Grobben (27 August 1854, in Brno \u2013 13 April 1945, in Salzburg) was an Austrian biologist.[1] He graduated from, and later worked at, the University of Vienna, chiefly on molluscs and crustaceans.

Christiano is a molecular geneticist in the field of dermatology. Her research focuses on genes involved in hair and skin growth, as well as treatments for hair loss and skin cancers.[1] She is the Richard and Mildred Rhodebeck Professor of Dermatology and Professor of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons./nChristiano attended Nutley High School in Nutley, New Jersey.[2] She attended Douglass College, a women-only residential college within Rutgers University-New Brunswick, earning her Bachelor of Science degree in 1987.[3] She continued her scientific training at Rutgers University, earning her Master of Science in Molecular Pathology and Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics. As a postdoctoral researcher in the Jefferson Medical College Department of Dermatology, Christiano focused on genetic blistering skin diseases.[4]/nChristiano established her laboratory at Columbia University in 1996.[4]/nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where a patient's immune cells attack their own hair follicles, causing hair to fall out in clumps. In collaboration with the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF), Christiano and her group were able to compare genomes between patients and healthy control individuals.[4]/nIn 2009, Christiano and her group published the discovery of 139 genetic markers linked to alopecia areata.[4] Although many expected that genes involved in alopecia would also be involved in other inherited hair and skin diseases, they found that genes linked to alopecia were linked to other types of autoimmune diseases instead: type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease.[4]/nIn patients with alopecia, one of the genes that are hyperactive is IKZF1, which results in overproduction of immune cells that subsequently attack hair follicles. In contrast, many cancer cells escape detection and elimination by immune cells. Scientists in the Christiano Lab were able to activate IKZF1 in certain cancer types, e.g. melanoma, and suppress tumor growth.[5]/nIn addition to her efforts in understanding the genetics behind alopecia, Christiano is also researching ways to treat it and other types of hair loss. Most therapies focus on stopping or slowing down hair loss, while hair transplantation simply moves one part of the scalp to another. Christiano's goal is to grow human hair in lab settings that could be then transplanted onto human scalp with minimal scarring. Although mouse and rat hair easily grow in lab, the methods do not work as well when growing human hair.[6] In 2013, Christiano and her group adapted the hanging drop cell culture technique to grow human cells that successfully grew human hair when transplanted onto the backs of nude mice.[7][8][9][10] In 2015, Christiano and her group found that a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors promoted hair follicles to enter growth phase.[11][12] In 2019, Christiano and colleagues developed a \"hair farm\", using a 3D-printed scaffold as a microenvironment to grow human skin cells and produce hair.[13][14][15]/nChristiano is the first member in her family to attend college and graduate school.[4] Hair has been an integral part of her family, as her grandfather was a barber and her mother was retired hairdresser.[4] In her first year of establishing her lab, Christiano started experiencing hair loss and was diagnosed with alopecia areata.[4] While it was known that alopecia areata is genetic, it was not well understood which genes were involved and how they worked.

A teacher, experimenter and theorist, he made a lasting contribution to science in his lengthy career, throughout which he sought to encourage specialists in different fields to meet and share insights./nPaul Weiss was born in Vienna, the son of a Jewish couple, Carl S. Weiss, a businessman, and Rosalie Kohn Weiss. His background favoured music, poetry, and philosophy \u2013 Weiss himself was a violinist \u2013 but an uncle encouraged an interest in science. Weiss received his baccalaureate in 1916./nAfter the end of the First World War, having served for three years as an officer in the artillery, he commenced studies in mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna, (now Vienna University of Technology). He then shifted his focus to biology with a minor in physics. He absorbed the studies of Edmond B. Wilson, Edwin G. Concklin, and Theodor Bovari and completed his doctoral thesis in 1922 under Hans Leo Przibram, then director of the Biological Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, on the responses of butterflies to light and gravity./nAfter completing his thesis he traveled widely in Europe, becoming an assistant director of the Biological Research Institute of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. In 1926 he married Maria Helen Blaschka./nHis studies of limb regeneration in newts showed that a complete limb could regenerate even if particular tissue forms were removed from the stump: the required types of tissue would reform. He studied cell differentiation and the transplanting and reforming of connections in the nerves of limbs, using newts and frogs for his experiments. He went on to consider neurobiology and morphogenesis. He introduced the idea of the \"natural experiment\" \u2013 the quest for suggestive examples  from nature \u2013 and this became a favourite teaching device./nIn 1930 a prospective post at the University of Frankfurt was lost due to the depression and Weiss moved to the United States. In 1931, after studying developing cell cultures for some time, Weiss won a Sterling fellowship to work with Ross Granville Harrison at Yale. He took US citizenship in 1939, publishing his Principles of Development the same year.[1] From 1933 to 1954, after working briefly at Yale, he taught at the University of Chicago./nIn his work on tissue cultures Weiss outlined several features of cell proliferation: he showed how cell-patterns are affected by their substrate and, through grafts, proved that basic neural patterns of coordination were self-differentiating rather than learned, though higher vertebrates can \"retrain\" reflexes./nDuring World War II he worked with the American government on nerve injury. In 1947 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.[2] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1953.[3] In 1954 he became one of the first professors at the new Rockefeller University in New York, where he remained for fifteen years. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that same year.[4] Paul Weiss was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Jimmy Carter in 1979.

Edwards also helped organize the deep biosphere research community by heading the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory Project on Loihi Seamount, and serving on several program steering committees involving ocean drilling.[1] Edwards taught at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and later became a professor at the University of Southern California.[1][2]/nKatrina Edwards was born the third of five children on March 15, 1968, in Columbus, Ohio, to Sandra and Timothy Edwards.[1]  At Columbus Alternative High School Katrina completed her secondary education, and pursued an early career at the Delaware Municipal Airport in general airport operations and later as a chief flight instructor.[1][2] While continuing her work at the airport, Edwards attended Ohio State University to pursue an undergraduate degree in geology.[3] In 1994, she received her bachelor's degree with honors.[1]/nIn 1996 Edwards left her work at the airport to attend the University of Wisconsin, Madison where she studied geochemistry, mineralogy, microbiology, oceanography, molecular biology and ecology.[2][4]  There she earned a master's in geology with emphasis on isotope geochemistry and in 1999 she earned the first Ph.D. in geomicrobiology awarded by the university.[1][3] It was also at UW-Madison she met her future husband.[3]  In 1999 Edwards moved to Massachusetts to join Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.[3]  There she established a geomicrobiology lab, which focused on the microbial transformation and degradation of solid Earth materials, specifically rocks, minerals, and organic matter.[3]/nKatrina Edwards died on October 26, 2014, at the age of 46.  Edwards is survived by her parents, her siblings, and her three children.[2]/nWhile at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Edwards was an associate scientist in geochemistry and marine chemistry.[2] In 2006, she began working at the University of Southern California (USC).[1] There she was a professor in the environmental studies, earth sciences, and biological sciences departments and became a mentor for many students and postdoctoral researchers.[2] In 2009, she helped established the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations (C-DEBI) at USC.[1] Creation of the technology center was done in partnership with USC, national laboratories, and several major research universities and was supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a $29 million grant.[1] Since then, the Deep Carbon Observatory is also continuing to organize collaborative work on biological activity in the deep subsurface.[5]/nEdwards, as founding director and principal investigator of C-DEBI, worked with other scientists and led multiple expeditions in the North Atlantic Ocean, including international projects to explore the ocean's crust through deep drilling.[1][2]  She also headed the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory Project on Loihi Seamount, which was supported by the NSF.[2] The goal of these expeditions was to gather information about the role of intraterrestrials (organisms living under the sea floor or inside the earth) and their role in what she called \"the tooth decay of the solid Earth,\" otherwise known as the degradation and transformation of Earth solid minerals and organic matter.[1][3]/nEdwards authored over 100 published papers, contributed to and edited several microbiology textbooks, served as the associate editor of American Mineralogist, and served on the editorial boards of Environmental Microbiology, Geobiology and Geomicrobiology journals. Her 2000 paper, \"An Archaeal Iron-oxidizing Extreme Acidophile Important in Acid Mine Drainage\" featured as the cover story in the journal Science.  Edwards also published a blog on Scientific American's website, relating the experiences of her team so members of the public could follow the events as they occurred during a research expedition in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.[1]/nEdwards studied intraterrestrial transformation pathways (metabolic processes) of iron (Fe) in sulfide-mineral deposits and the effects of their metabolic reactions on their surroundings. Because of its abundance, dynamic solubility, and oxidation-reduction properties, iron is an important element in the biochemistry of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. It is abundant in most fluids discharged from hydrothermal vents. Iron plumed from hydrothermal vents in sulfide mineral deposits precipitate (form a solid) with sulfur (S). The precipitate then becomes part of the physical structure of the sulfide deposit. Iron also has the potential to act as the substrate for microbial metabolism and respiration. This means that it can be reduced during a microbial process that uses it in the place of oxygen to create energy. This and other studies by Edwards have revealed how microbes can live deep in the Earth's crust in bedrock that was previously thought to be devoid of life.[6]/nEdwards was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2010 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011.

The Bassanese naturalist Antonio Gaidon, guided him towards his first scientific studies and was Brocchi's first master in the geological and mineralogical disciplines. Gaidon introduced Brocchi to the naturalists Giuseppe Olivi and Alberto Fortis, the latter accompanying Brocchi on geological excursions in the Bassano area.[1] In 1802 he was appointed professor of botany in the new lyceum of Brescia; but he more especially devoted himself to geological researches in the adjacent districts. The fruits of these labors appeared in different publications, particularly in his Trattato mineralogico e chimico sulle miniere di ferro del dipartimento del Mella (1808) a treatise on the iron mines of the Mella traditional region. These researches procured him the office of inspector of mines in the recently established Kingdom of Italy, and enabled him to extend his investigations over a great part of the country.[2]/nIn 1811 Brocchi produced a valuable essay entitled Memoria mineralogica sulla Valle di Fassa in Tirolo; but his most important work is the Conchiologia fossile subapennina con osservazioni geologiche sugli Apennini, e sul suolo adiacente (2 vols., Milan, 1814), containing accurate details of the structure of the Apennine range, and an account of the marine shell fossils of the Italian Tertiary strata compared with existing species. These subjects were further illustrated by his geognostic map, and his Catalogo ragionato di una raccolta di rocce, disposto con ordine geografico, per servire alla geognosia dell' Italia (Milan, 1817). His work Dello stato fisico del suolo di Roma (1820), with its accompanying map, is likewise noteworthy. In it he corrected the erroneous views of Scipione Breislak, who conceived that Rome occupies the site of a volcano, to which he ascribed the volcanic materials that cover the seven hills. Brocchi pointed out that these materials were derived either from Monte Albano, an extinct volcano, twelve miles from the city, or from the Monti Cimini, still farther to the north.[2]/nIn 1814 Brocchi presented the thesis that species, like individuals, age and eventually die out \u2014 an idea that later influenced Charles Darwin.[3]/nSeveral papers by him, on mineralogical subjects, appeared in the Biblioteca Italiana from 1816 to 1823. In the latter year, Brocchi sailed for Egypt, in order to explore the geology of that country and report on its mineral resources. Every facility was granted by Mehemet Ali, who in 1825 appointed him one of a commission to examine the territory of the recently conquered Kingdom of Sennar; but Brocchi fell a victim to the climate, and died at Khartoum on the 25th of September 1826, possibly of dysentery.[2][4] Much of his writings and collections are now housed in the Museo Civico di Bassano.", "879527": "Alexander Sergeevich Spirin (Russian: \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d) (4 September 1931 \u2013 30 December 2020[1]) was a Russian biochemist, Distinguished Professor at the Lomonosov Moscow State University (since 1999),[2] a Director of Institute of Protein Research Russian Academy of Sciences, Puschino (\u041f\u0443\u0449\u0438\u043d\u043e-\u043d\u0430-\u041e\u043a\u0435), Moscow Region (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c), Academician of Russian Academy of Sciences.

In addition to making headway in revealing the structure of DNA, her research has implications for the understanding of aging and cancer.[7]/nTitia de Lange originally wanted to study chemistry after finishing high school in the Netherlands but the lack of women in chemistry among students and teachers alike convinced her to study biology with a biochemistry track instead.[5] In her time at the University of Amsterdam she worked for mentor Richard Flavell at the National Institute for Medical Research where she completed her master's thesis.[5] Her thesis focused on DNA translocation in \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia, a very rare form of thalassemia.[8] Her research identified a patient with \u03b3\u03b2-thalassemia with a DNA translocation that caused the inactivation of the \u03b2-Globin gene.[8] de Lange spoke highly of the lab saying \"That was where I first saw how science is really done. \u2026 It was a very vibrant, competitive, international lab. It was a lot of fun, so that made me stay in science.\"[5]/nDe Lange started to gain interest in telomeres while earning her Ph.D. at the Netherlands Cancer Institute.[5] Telomeres gradually became the major focus of her research. After receiving her Ph.D. in 1985, de Lange completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco in Harold Varmus's Lab from 1985 to 1990.[5] While working at UCSF, de Lange continued her work on telomeres. de Lange discovered that sperm cells have telomeres that are several kilobase pairs longer than somatic cells.[9] She also found that tumor cells also have significantly shorter telomeres.[9] This research was significant in establishing the role of telomeres in both aging as well as cancer. Telomeres are repetitive nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes that function as protective elements from improper DNA repair.[10] The nucleotide sequence of telomeres is TTAGGG.[10] As a person ages telomeres are gradually shortened with each round of DNA replication, as not all of the DNA sequence is fully replicated.[10] Chromosome ends are threatened by various pathways, DNA-damage signaling pathways involving ATM or ATR kinase as well as double-strand break repair pathways, Non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair.[11]/nAt Rockefeller University her research focused on identifying proteins associated with telomeres and their role in protecting telomeres from processes of DNA repair.[5] In her first several years she dedicated a long amount of time and resources to identifying the major protein components of human telomeres.[5] In 1995, she identified and purified the Telomeric-repeat binding factor protein 1 (TRF1).[12] With the assistance of Bas van Steensel, de Lange conducted various studies on proteins associated with telomeres.[5] She found that TRF1 is crucial in the regulation of the length of telomeres.[13] In her research, she proposed that TRF1 inhibits the action of telomerase.[13] Telomerase is an RNA dependent DNA polymerase that can elongate telomeres and is essential in the maintenance of telomeric DNA.[9][12] Telomerase can counteract the shortening of telomeres, which occurs during the DNA replication process.[14] She and her co-investigators, Bas van Steensel and Agata Smogorzewska, also discovered the protein TRF2  and found that it prevents the end-to-end fusing of telomeres, in addition to other functions.[15]/nOne of de Lange's major discoveries was the discovery of the t-loop structure of telomeres in her collaboration with Jack Griffith.[16] This was shown through electron microscopy demonstrating that linear telomeric DNA can be remodeled by TRF2 into duplex loops (t loops).[14] This architectural change allows for TRF2 to sequester the ends of telomeres, which function to safeguard telomeres by covering overhanging single strands of DNA.[14] This mechanism protects against the improper activation of DNA damage checkpoints by natural chromosome ends.[14] Previous research had observed that in addition to protecting the ends of chromosomes, telomeric complexes also allow cells to distinguish random DNA breaks and natural chromosome ends.[14]/nIn 2005, de Lange came to the crucial realization that six telomeric proteins form a dynamic protein complex, that she named shelterin, named for its function of protecting chromosome ends.[17] The six shelterin subunits are: TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap1, TPP1, and POT1.[17] Shelterin subunits are not the only proteins that associate with telomeres but they differ from other proteins by meeting the criteria of not accumulating in areas beside chromosome ends, their function is limited to telomeres, and they are present at telomeres throughout the cell cycle.[17] Shelterin allows for telomeres to be essentially hidden from the DNA damage surveillance, without its safeguarding chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways where the telomeres would be mistaken for damaged DNA.[17]/nTitia de Lange's research has proven to be invaluable in the area of telomere research and has led to greater understanding for cancer development as well as genome maintenance.[5] Her research has catalyzed more research into the important role of telomeres in tumor development./nDe Lange is the recipient of several awards including the 2001 Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research, the 2008 Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center Prize, the 2010 AACR Clowes Memorial Award, the 2011 Vanderbilt Prize in Biomedical Science, the 2011 Vilcek Prize in Biomedical Science, the 2013 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the 2014 Gairdner International Award, and the 2017 Rosenstiel Award.[6][8]/nShe is an elected member of multiple organizations including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, The European Molecular Biology Organization, and the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences.[6] In 2022 she was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.[18]", "14183356": "Walter Garstang FLS FZS (9 February 1868 \u2013 23 February 1949), a Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford and Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds, was one of the first to study the functional biology of marine invertebrate larvae. His best known works on marine larvae were his poems published as Larval Forms and Other Zoological Verses, especially The Ballad of the Veliger. They describe the form and function of several marine larvae as well as illustrating some controversies in evolutionary biology of the time.[1]/nGarstang was known for his vehement opposition to  Ernst Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, now discredited. He is also noted for his hypothesis on chordate evolution, known as Garstang's theory, which suggests an alternative route for chordate evolution from echinoderms.[2][3]/nWalter Garstang was born on 9 February 1868 as the eldest son of Dr Walter Garstang of Blackburn and his wife Matilda Mary Wardley, and older brother of the archaeologist John Garstang.[4]/nIn 1895, he married Lucy Ackroyd; they had one son, Walter Lucian Garstang,.[5] and five daughters./nIn 1884, at the age of 16, he was awarded a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford and was initially going to study medicine. Under the guidance of Henry Nottidge Moseley, he joined the school of Zoology and graduated in 1888 at the age of 20. Before graduation, Garstang was offered a position as secretary and assistant to Gilbert C Bourne, the new resident director of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom in Plymouth. There he met Ray Lankester. In 1891, he left Plymouth and was a Berkley Research Fellow under Milnes Marshall at Owens College, Manchester. A year later, Garstang returned to Plymouth as Assistant Naturalist, only to be elected a Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1893. In 1894, while Ray Lankester held the Linacre Chair, he became a lecturer at Lincoln College and in 1895 he started the series of Easter classes in which he took students on week-long field courses to Plymouth.[6]/nBetween 1902 and 1907, Garstang was employed by the MBA as the principal investigator working on North Sea fisheries. He helped to establish a fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft that was later to become the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom). Garstang instigated a series of detailed fisheries surveys throughout the southern North Sea aboard the RV Huxley, under the auspices of the newly formed International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).[7]/nGarstang was Professor of Zoology at the University of Leeds from 1907 to 1933.[8] The Garstang Building at the university is named in his honour. In 1912, in cooperation with Professor Alfred Denny of the University of Sheffield he established the Robin Hood's Bay Marine Laboratory. The minutes of Sheffield's Faculty of Pure Science on 12 March 1912[9] record the following resolution that was carried unanimously: That the Faculty approves of the proposal to extend the work of the Department of Zoology by co-operating with the University of Leeds in establishing a small marine Zoological Laboratory at Robin Hood's Bay./nGarstang made the radical suggestion that the chordates evolved from the larvae of another group, whether the larvae of hemichordates or of echinoderms, by progenesis (which Garstang called \"neoteny\"). Echinoderm larvae, like chordates, are bilaterally symmetric. Especially notable are their similarities to larvae of hemichordates, which are a step closer to chordates as they share two of the five most commonly noted chordate characteristics, namely a hollow neural tube and pharyngeal slits.[10]/nGarstang's idea has been expanded and is supported by many lines of evidence. Perhaps most interesting and compelling is the fact that some amphibians can stay in larval form and still reach sexual maturity\u2014this shows that echinoderm larvae could, theoretically, have become sexually mature and simply stopped morphing into adults, instead evolving into chordate ancestors. Species that show this refusal to leave the larval stage include mud puppies and other salamanders, which either partially or completely show neoteny (also called pedomorphism): retention of juvenile traits or phenotypes after sexual maturity./nGarstang's hypothesis (this term is also used for his proposals on gastropod torsion, as described in The Ballad of the Veliger) was revolutionary for both its time and idea: it suggests that not only may single species evolve, but that single life stages of species may evolve into separate organisms. The hypothesis, which Garstang proposed in the early 20th century, seemed far-fetched at the time of its conception and did not receive support until after Garstang's death.[11]/nFirst published in 1951, two years after his death, Larval Forms and Other Zoological Verses (ISBN\u00a0978-0-226-28423-1) is a compilation of 26 poems by Garstang on the form, function and development of various larval invertebrates. Although they were published posthumously, Garstang had had a desire to publish them for many years and never did because he always thought he would add to them. Except for the introduction written by Sir Alister Hardy, everything in the final publication, including the title and order of the poems, was his own work./nMany of his poems were written to express his views on the scientific theories of the time. Most notable may be The Axolotl and the Ammocoete which speculates an evolutionary relationship between the Axolotl and the Ammocoete. Alister Hardy wrote on this in the Introduction to Larval Forms:/nOnly a few months before he died Garstang had drafted a communication to Nature to put forward his latest suggestion that Amphioxus might be regarded as a paedomorphic ammocoete-like larva of a Cyclostome; it was never sent, because the day on which he was to have posted it he found that the whole of his idea had recently and quite independently been published by the great Stensio./nMost of these poems were written before 1922 and reflect the knowledge and theories of that time. In some of the poems, some of the animals, or species of animals, have speaking parts. The poems included in his final work are:/nWalter Garstang's most famous zoological verse, The Ballad of the Veliger, was first published in 1928 and privately printed.

He attended the City College of New York and was initially interested in biology, but found the courses uninspiring and instead chose to focus on math and physics. During his undergraduate work he took a leave of absence to work in a biology laboratory, where he studied the genetics of bacteria.[1] He graduated in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics.[3] He then began his graduate studies at Columbia University in 1940, studying cellular physiology under the supervision of H.B. Steinbach. Spiegelman joined Steinbach in his move to Washington University School of Medicine two years later, and received his PhD from that institution in 1944.[1] His graduate work focused on what was then known as enzymatic \"induction\" or \"adaptation\", now known to reflect changes in gene expression in response to environmental factors.[1] He continued to work at Washington University until 1948, and then took a one-year Public Health Service fellowship at the University of Minnesota.[1][3]/nIn 1949, Spiegelman joined the faculty at the University of Illinois, where he would spend the next 20 years of his academic career.[1][3] His research in this time focused on nucleic acids and particularly on the enzymes associated with nucleic acid synthesis, originating from work on bacteriophage with RNA genomes such as MS2 phage and bacteriophage Q\u03b2.[1] His work with Q\u03b2 RNA led to a noted  experiment with self reproducing RNA structures called Spiegelman's Monster.[1][2] Among his best-known work is his research on nucleic acid hybridization,[1] much of which was conducted in along with Kim Atwood and Ferruccio Ritossa[4] building on work by Rich and Davies in 1956,[5] which helped to lay the groundwork for advances in recombinant DNA technology.[6][1]/nSpiegelman's later research focused on cancer and in 1969 he moved to the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, becoming a professor of human genetics and development as well as the directory of the Institute of Cancer Research.

Cantley (born February 20, 1949) is an American cell biologist and biochemist who has made significant advances to the understanding of cancer metabolism. Among his most notable contributions are the discovery and study of the enzyme PI-3-kinase, now known to be important to understanding cancer and diabetes mellitus.[1][2] He is currently Meyer Director and Professor of Cancer Biology at the  Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.  He was formerly a professor in the Departments of Systems Biology and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, Massachusetts. In 2016, he was elected Chairman of the Board for the Hope Funds for Cancer Research./nCantley grew up in West Virginia, remaining there at Wesleyan College where he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry in 1971.  Cantley obtained his PhD at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he worked with Gordon Hammes on enzyme kinetics, using FRET to study enzyme conformational changes.  In 1975 he moved to Harvard University for a postdoctoral fellowship under Guido Guidotti, where he discovered that an impurity in commercial preparations of ATP, vanadate, acts as a transition state analog for phosphate hydrolysis.  In 1978 Cantley became assistant professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard, being promoted to associate professor in 1981.  In 1985, he became a full professor in physiology at Tufts University School of Medicine.  In 1985 Cantley and colleagues Malcolm Whitman, David Kaplan, Tom Roberts, and Brian Schaffhausen made the seminal discovery of the existence of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K).  In 1992, Cantley moved to Harvard Medical School as a Professor of Cell Biology and the Director of the Division of Signal Transduction at the former Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center).  In 2003, Cantley became a founding member of the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School.  In 2007, Cantley also became the Director of Cancer Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He joined the faculty of Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital in 2012.[1][2][3][4] Dr. Cantley was elected the Chairman of the Board of the Hope Funds for Cancer Research in 2016.[5]/nCantley is married to Vicki Sato, herself a prominent figure in the pharmaceutical industry and a professor at Harvard University in both the Business and Medical Schools./nIn a series of studies spanning several years, Cantley and colleagues demonstrated that a kinase activity associated with the middle T oncoprotein is a phosphoinositide kinase,[7] that it is a novel type of phosphoinositide kinase that phosphorylates the 3' position on the inositol ring,[8] and that this phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) is activated by growth factors to produce novel 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, in particularly PtdIns(3,4,5)P3[9] that had previously been identified in physiologically stimulated human neutrophils.[10]  In subsequent years Cantley and colleagues identified critical aspects of the regulation of PI-3-kinase by growth factor receptors.  Specifically, they discovered that the catalytic subunit p110 dimerizes with the regulatory subunit p85,[11] and that the SH2 domain of p85 specifically recognized phosphotyrosines[12] on growth factor receptors or adaptor proteins via the pY-X-X-M motif.[13][14]/nThe Cantley lab has also made seminal contributions to understanding signaling downstream of PI-3-kinase.  They discovered that the Pleckstrin Homology domain of AKT binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (and PtdIns(3,4)P2) and that this binding is critical for activation of AKT catalytic activity.[15][16]  They further demonstrated that tuberin/TSC2 is a critical substrate of AKT,[17] and together with the laboratory of John Blenis they discovered that AKT phosphorylation of tuberin/TSC2 is required for activation of mTOR TORC1 kinase activity[18] via regulation of the small GTPase rheb.[19]  The Cantley lab also was one of a few labs that nearly simultaneously identified LKB1 as a regulator of AMPK that also serves to regulate TORC1.[20][21]/nFor the discovery of PI-3-Kinase and its role in cancer metabolism, Cantley was one of eleven recipients of the inaugural Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, \"the world's richest academic prize for medicine and biology. The prize, which carries a $3 million cash award, recognizes excellence in research aimed at curing intractable diseases and human life.\"[22] \nThe fundamental and far-reaching nature of the discovery of PI-3-kinase, together with Cantley's role in mapping the upstream regulation of PI-3-kinase and the downstream signaling pathways, have led to speculation that Cantley is a likely candidate for the Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology.[23]  The growing evidence for a primary role for PI-3-kinase in cancer[24][25] and its critical role in insulin signaling[26] have served to strengthen the significance of this fundamentally important discovery./nThe first drug targeting the PI-3-kinase pathway as a treatment for cancer - Idelalisib (PI3K Delta inhibitor) - was approved by the FDA as a treatment for leukemia and two types of lymphoma in July 2014.[27] Other drugs are currently in clinical development./nIn 1994, the Cantley lab published a novel strategy to determine the sequence specificity of phosphopeptide binding domains (initially SH2 domains).[13]\nSubsequently, the oriented peptide library approach was extended to identify the substrate specificity of protein kinases toward synthetic peptides.[28]  This approach was then extended to characterize the specificity of Ser/Thr kinases and phospho-Ser/Thr binding domains.[29]  This approach was used to characterize the substrate specificity of a large number of protein kinases.  The kinase specificity matrices generated from these experiments served as the basis for creating the website Scansite, allowing the de novo identification of candidate phosphorylation sites in an arbitrary protein.[30][31]/nIn later research, the oriented peptide library approach has also been used to characterize protease cleavage specificity.[32]  Modification of the original oriented peptide approach has allowed for large scale, kinome-wide determination of protein kinase specificity.[33]/nIn 1997, the Cantley lab discovered that the enzymes that had been referred to as type II PIP-kinases, instead of using PtdIns(4)P as a substrate, in fact required PtdIns(5)P as a substrate to produce PtdIns(4,5)P2.[34]  Further research demonstrated that PtdIns(5)P is naturally occurring in all eukaryotes./nIt is remarkable that of the seven naturally occurring phosphoinositides, the existence of four of them (PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) was discovered by Cantley and colleagues.[8][9][34][35]/nThe role of PI-3-kinase in anabolic signaling by insulin, IGF-1, and other growth factors makes a straightforward link between metabolism and cancer, especially in light of the discovery that the PIK3CA gene encoding PI-3-kinase is an oncogene.[36]/nIn recent years Cantley and colleagues have made additional links between metabolic regulation and oncogenic transformation with their discovery that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase is associated with cancer.[37][38]  This discovery provides a molecular basis for understanding the Warburg effect.  Cantley is now a major player in the resurgence of the importance of the Warburg effect in the process of oncogenesis.[39]/nCantley was part of the Stand Up to Cancer \"dream team\" that was brought together to investigate ways to target PI-3-kinase as a way to treat women's cancers, and he now leads a national effort targeting triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer with novel drug combinations.[40] Recent research found that high levels of Vitamin C halted the growth of aggressive forms of colorectal tumors.[41] His lab also elucidated the role of Nrf2 in serine production in non-small cell lung cancer, with potential implications for pancreatic and other cancers as well.[42]/nLewis C.

During his eleven years at UM, most of his research was done at MBL, where he worked on the daily rhythms of color change of fiddler crabs.  Some of his most important work during this time period was his 1957 discovery, along with Robert A.

This discovery was important in broadening our understanding of how many marine invertebrates feed and how energy and nutrients flow through marine ecosystems.[4]/nIn 1964, Stephens joined the faculty of the University of California at Irvine (UCI) as the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology.  While at UCI, he spent his career refining and expanding his findings of amino acid uptake by invertebrates, conclusively showing that bacteria were not involved in the process, and that the process was a significant supplementary source of nutrition for many animals.

He graduated from Cornell University in 1974 (BA, biological sciences) and completed his PhD in the laboratory of Peter Palese in 1980,[8] studying genetic reassortment of influenza virus. As a post-doctoral fellow in David Baltimore's laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1979\u20131982), Racaniello used recombinant DNA technology to clone and sequence the genome of the small RNA animal virus poliovirus. Using these tools, he generated the first infectious clone of an animal RNA virus.[9] Construction of the infectious clone revolutionized modern virology./nRacaniello established his own research laboratory at Columbia University in the fall of\n1982.[10] The aim of his laboratory is to understand replication and pathogenesis of small\nRNA animal viruses, picornaviruses. The reproductive cycle of a virus begins with its attachment\nto and entry into the cytoplasm of a cell. His laboratory identified CD155 (poliovirus\nreceptor, PVR); a cell surface protein, and member of the immunoglobin superfamily as\nthe protein that mediates this process.[11][12] Understanding how the interaction between virus and cell alters the viral\nparticle and how virus entry is facilitated by the interaction has helped understand the\nmeans by which poliovirus infection is initiated.[13][14]/nHumans are the only known natural host for poliovirus. The study of viral disease is\ntherefore only feasible with the generation of a small animal model. Though not\nsusceptible to poliovirus infection, murine cells do allow for efficient replication of\npoliovirus RNA introduced into the cytoplasm. Taking advantage of this observation,\nRacaniello's laboratory constructed the first small animal model of poliomyelitis. Mice\nproducing the human CD155 protein were generated and infected with poliovirus.[15] These mice exhibited all symptoms and pathology of\npoliomyelitis observed in humans, including flaccid paralysis and spinal cord lesions.\nThese mice today are used not only to continue to understand poliovirus pathogenesis but\nas a means to test the safety of stocks of the polio vaccine./nPoliomyelitis is a disease of the central nervous system; however, it is believed that\nCD155 is present on the surface of most if not all cells of the body. An element present\nwithin the virus RNA was hypothesized to govern viral tropism which tissues the virus\ninfected. Newborn mice producing PVR were infected with wild-type poliovirus and a\nchimeric poliovirus in which this element was replaced with the same region from hepatitis C virus,\na liver specific virus, or coxsackievirus B3, a virus that infects the heart or meninges.\nMice infected with any of these viruses exhibited symptoms of poliomyelitis. Therefore,\nthis region of poliovirus does not determine tissue tropism of the virus.[16]/nSecretion of interferon is one means the body uses to ward off pathogens, including viral\ndiseases. However, poliovirus is able to replicate when interferon is added to medium\nused to culture mammalian cells. Racaniello's laboratory believes that this resistance is\ndictated by the 2A protein of poliovirus.[17][18]\nRacaniello's laboratory continues to investigate how poliovirus circumvents the immune\nresponse of the host, enhancing our understanding of its pathogenesis and why it is a\ndisease of the central nervous system./nEven though global eradication of poliovirus was initiated in 1988, and poliovirus\ninfection continues throughout the world today, Racaniello's laboratory has begun to\ninvestigate the reproductive cycle and pathogenesis of other picornaviruses similar to poliovirus.\nThese viruses include enteroviruses D68 (EV-D68) and 70 (EV70), human rhinovirus,\ncoxsackievirus A21 and echovirus 1. Infectious clones of EV70 and several serotypes of\nrhinoviruses were generated.[19][20][21] These reagents have been used to understand how host range of a virus\ncan be altered and to identify cellular proteins necessary for replication of the viral RNA. Racaniello has also begun to study how these viruses evade the host innate immune system, in particular interferon type I response. Infection of cultured cells with human rhinovirus 1A results in the cleavage of the integral component IPS-1 (MAVS, Cardif).[22]\nIn addition a small animal model of virus echovirus 1 pathogenesis has been established.[23]/nRacaniello is also interested in picornavirus evolution and movement. To this means, he intends to isolate and identify picornaviruses found in the wild throughout the Northeastern United States./nRacaniello's laboratory continues to pursue the fundamental principles of virus biology.[24] Together with a long-term collaborator, Racaniello's lab has determined that neurotropism of Zika virus and enterovirus D 68 are not a recently acquired phenotypes. Results from their studies examining Zika virus infection of the neonatal mouse brain revealed that cortical developmental pathologies associated with virus infection may result from architecture defects of the developing brain. Data from their research understanding the mechanism of enterovirus D68 associated acute flaccid myelitis suggests multiple means by which paralysis may result from virus infection.[25][26]/nIn collaboration with members of the Center for Infection and Immunology at Columbia, Rosenfeld and Racaniello described a cross-reactive anti-enterovirus antibody response.[27] These results challenge the idea that enterovirus infections are modulated solely by a homotypic humoral immune response./nUnderstanding that the World Wide Web is a primary scientific tool, Racaniello is one of the co-creators of BioCrowd,[28] a social network designed to bring together scientists of all disciplines. Racaniello's virology blog,[29] and podcasts This Week in Virology;[30] This Week in Parasitism[31] with colleagues Dickson Despommier and Daniel O.

While listening to one of his father's records at home when he was 4 years old, his father saw him mimicking a conductor's mannerisms and had him appear on a live TV show conducting his orchestra. That and other TV appearances made him a celebrity in Venezuela even performing in movies conducting an orchestra.[5] In adult life Romero never pursued a professional career as a musician but continued performing as an amateur.[6][7]/nRomero attributes his decision to become a scientist the day the press announced the launch of Sputnik. His decision to study biology was inspired by the Jacques-Yves Cousteau film \"The Silent World\".[8]/nHe obtained a Licenciatura in biology, with a zoology concentration, from the Universitat de Barcelona,[9] in 1977, while working as a scientist in several institutions and as science writer for several printed, radio, and TV media. He obtained his doctorate in biology from the University of Miami,[10] in Coral Gables, Florida, with a doctoral dissertation on the evolution and behavior of cavefish./nRomero met his wife Ana during the early 1970s while both were undergraduate students at the Universitat de Barcelona.[citation needed]/nIn 1994 he fled his native Venezuela to the United States, after denouncing the killing of dolphins by Venezuelan fishermen and receiving death threats. Since returning to the US he has taught at the University of Miami, Miami-Dade Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Macalester College, and Arkansas State University. Romero accepted the position as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 2009, a position that he held until 2014. He became dean of the George and Mildred Weissman School of Arts and Sciences at Baruch College/City University of New York, effective July 2016,[11] and stepped down in June 2020.[12]/nWhile an undergraduate student in biology at the Universitat de Barcelona in Spain, Romero volunteered at the Museum of Zoology (later renamed as Museum of Natural Sciences) where he created the Hydrobiology Section [13] led a group of other undergraduates to work on aquatic organisms reorganizing some of the collections and re-identifying some of the mislabeled specimens. He also volunteered working at the Museum of Geology of the Seminario Conciliar of Barcelona where he described several new species of Middle Triassic (240-235\u00a0million years old) horseshoe crabs and a set of fossils that he described as an entirely new group (subphylum) of animals never reported to science before.[14]/nAs a graduate student at the University of Miami, Romero specialized on the study of the evolution, behavior, and ecology of cavefishes. Through these studies he was the first to propose that colonization of cave environments was an active process via behavioral adaptations preceding morphological ones (e.g. blindness and depigmentation).[15] Later he proposed a new hypothesis aimed at explaining the mechanisms leading towards the loss of eyes and pigmentation among these and other cave animals. He suggested that the mechanism behind this phenomenon was a little understood biological process at the time called phenotypic plasticity. This challenged the typological view of all cave creatures as completely differentiated from a genetic viewpoint from their surface (epigean) ancestors. According to Romero all what was needed for the evolution of drastically morphologically distinct cave species were just a few changes in the genes controlling the development of features such as eyes and pigmentation. These and other ideas were summarized in a book.[16]/nRomero studied the history and practices of exploitation of marine mammals in the Caribbean basin. To that end he conducted field and archival studies in Venezuela,[17] Trinidad and Tobago,[18] Grenada,[19] St Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, and Bermuda[20][21][22] as well as in libraries and archives in the northeastern U.S. that keep logbooks from whaling vessels. He concluded that local shore whaling combined with Yankee whaling were responsible for the depletion of many whale and dolphin populations throughout the Caribbean basin and that both types of whaling influenced each other from a cultural viewpoint.[23] For example, he recorded chants by local Caribbean whalers that mimicked those of Yankee whalers from the nineteenth century, demonstrating that cultural influence.[24]/nRomero has described a number of fossil species of horseshoe crabs,[25] jellyfishes[26] (of which there are very few good-quality fossil impressions from around the world) and a group of very unusual species that he grouped under the name of Paleocyphonates, which he described as a new subphylum. He proposed the hypothesis that these extinct, medium-size fossil impressions represented the adult stage of today existing larva cyphonautes and supported such hypothesis not only with paleontological information but with physiological and developmental biology data as well.[27]/nIn addition to his studies on marine mammal exploitation in the Caribbean, Romero also carried out a number of field and archival studies about the exploitation of other marine animals in the same region. One of those allowed him to discover that the first animal population depleted by Europeans in the American continent was of a pearl oyster species (Pinctada imbricata) off the coast of Venezuela. In 1996 he studied historical records and used information about the biology of these and other species to explain its rapid disappearance.[28] Romero also conducted studies on the pollution caused by lead in gasoline in Venezuela \u2013 the only country in the Western Hemisphere that still produced leaded gasoline at that time. Those studies showed high levels of that contaminant in the Venezuelan environment and leaded gasoline was later eliminated from the market.[29][30][31] He also produced a study about all of the environmental-related programs in U.S. higher education institutions. He concluded that the number of those programs always spiked after the electoral wins by Democratic presidents.[32]/nRomero has published and taught on the history and philosophy of science, particularly on evolutionary ideas. Through his work he concluded that the initial resistance by French biologists to accept Charles Darwin's ideas was a combination of catholic mysticism and nationalism.[33] In another study he concluded that environmental classification and intellectual inertia delayed for centuries the acceptance of whales and dolphins as mammals, instead of being considered fish.[34] He has also worked on Darwin's life and published an analysis on how the British scientist was modifying his home at Downe, Kent, in order to accommodate to his scientific interests, his growing family and number of servants, as well as his health problems.

He encouraged her to learn to play the flute, violin, steel pan, recorder, and percussion.[9] She didn't realize she had a knack for science until high school. She did well in her math and science classes and that led her to consider a career in science when she had only ever thought of being a musician or a baker.[1] Initially she was interested in psychology and neuroscience due to a friend's interest in the area. Her interest in developmental genetics began with a summer internship in the lab of Joe Culotti at the University of Toronto.[10]/nExtavour received an Honors BSc at the University of Toronto. Her Ph.D. thesis was on germ cell selection in genetic mosaics and was published in 2001 in PNAS.[11]/nIn 2003 Extavour did a study at Cambridge University on the mechanisms of germ cell formation that showed animal germ cells were likely specified by inductive signals more often than previously thought.[12] This went against the mainstream scientific view at the time that animal germ cells are usually specified by maternally inherited determinants.[13] During a 2013 interview with Quanta Magazine, she explained the concepts of this research as such: \"Before there is even an embryo, the molecular content of some cells predetermines them to develop as either germ or soma. In other organisms, there is instead a signaling mechanism: An embryonic cell receives chemical signals from neighboring cells that activate (or repress) the genes that allow for germ-line function.\"[5]/nIn 2007 she started her independent laboratory in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University as an Assistant Professor. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 2011 and to Full Professor in 2014.[3] Some of Extavour's research during this period showed that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can help to induce primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the early stages of embryo development in a cricket.[14] Extavour and her colleagues were able to specify that two BMPs, BMP8b and BMP4, help induce PGCs in this insect. This is significant because it was the first demonstration of a specific signaling pathway operating in the induction of embryonic germ cells in an Invertebrate.[15]/nFrom 2010 to 2015 Extavour directed a national research collaborative called EDEN, which stands for Evo-Devo-Eco (evolutionary-developmental-ecological) Network.[16] The organization, funded by the National Science Foundation, encouraged scientists to develop and share tools and techniques for use in a broader spectrum of organisms than the traditionally studied laboratory model organisms.[5][8] Extavour believes that a number of deep evolutionary questions cannot be answered by examining only one organism, and thus hopes that science will move past the model organism paradigm.[7]/nExtavour sings Classical and Baroque music professionally.

Rose (born 25 July 1955) is a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Irvine./nMichael Roberson Rose was born on July 25, 1955. He obtained his B.S. in 1975 from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. In 1976 he obtained his M.S.. In 1978 he obtained his Ph.D from the University of Sussex.[1]/nHis Ph.D. advisor was Brian Charlesworth. His main area of work has been the evolution of aging, approached both theoretically and empirically via the technique of experimental evolution. In 1991, he published Evolutionary Biology of Aging exploring a view of the subject based on antagonistic pleiotropy, the hypothesis that aging is caused by genes that have two effects, one acting early in life and the other much later. The genes are favored by natural selection as a result of their early-life benefits, and the costs that accrue much later appear as incidental side-effects that we identify as aging. Dr. Rose has also suggested that aging can stop in a latter stage of life. The field of aging biology is divided between those who think that it will be very difficult to develop technology to postpone human aging and those who expect breakthroughs in this field in the near future. Rose is an outspoken advocate for the former position./nThe phenomenon was first described by George C. Williams in 1957, but it was Rose who coined the phrase \"antagonistic pleiotropy\". Rose's laboratory has conducted the longest-running experimental evolution experiment designed to test the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) are being bred for longevity by collecting eggs from the longest-lived flies in each generation.  The experiment has run since 1981, and has produced flies with quadruple the original life span[citation needed]. The prediction of the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis was that these long-lived flies would have much lower fertility early in life. The result has been the opposite - that the long-lived flies actually lay more eggs at every stage of life. Rose explains this result in terms of an interaction between genotype and environment. The long-lived flies show other weaknesses that would make them poor competitors in the wild, and perhaps these traits are the true areas of antagonistic pleiotropy. He is one of the biologists featured in the 1995 science documentary Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times. In 1997, Rose was awarded the Busse Research Prize by the World Congress of Gerontology. He has authored The Long Tomorrow: How Advances in Evolutionary Biology Can Help Us Postpone Aging./nIf the effect on fitness of increase in mortality is zero, as is the case after the age when survival affects reproduction, then natural selection does not weed out the tendency for rates of mortality to accelerate with age. The idea that selection for reproduction in youth causes accumulating dysfunction in later adulthood is a commonly accepted explanation for aging. Protagonistic pleiotropy is the opposite effect: beneficial effects in later life as a result of selection for reproduction in earlier life. Rose contends that a correct understanding of Hamilton's equations through mathematical modeling show that protagonistic pleiotropy is plausible.[2]/nRose's most recent book is Does Aging Stop?.[2] W. D. Hamilton advanced the idea that any gene killing an organism before it reproduced would be weeded out by natural selection. However, genes that kill later in life, after reproduction ceases, can remain in the population. For Rose, this suggests that aging is a result of \"declining forces of natural selection.\" He points to studies of the demographic data in large-scale fruit fly experiments and actuarial data for humans which he believes support the hypothesis that acceleration in death rates can halt in later life. According to Rose, mortality-rate plateaus have not often been noticed in humans because they are only seen in specific-age cohorts of the very old. His proposed explanation is that at a stage of life beyond the potential to reproduce, the effect of natural selection is no longer falling as it has 'bottomed out'. Rose suggests that if a decline in the effect of natural selection is responsible for aging, then when this decline finally ends, at post-reproductive age, aging could halt. He reasons it follows that aging is \"not a cumulative process of progressive chemical damage, like rust, at late ages, aging can stop\".[2]/nAccording to Rose, relative to the age of reproductive maturity a transition to the late-life stage of life occurs much later in humans than in the populations of flies for which there are data. In humans, the 'late-life' stage of life is only reached at 90 years old, whereas the data for flies scaled to humans would predict a 'late-life' stage for humans at 40\u201350 years old. Rose suggests that human populations' adoption of agriculture led to more children surviving to adulthood, and to reproduction occurring later in life. Agriculture is also hypothesized by Rose to have resulted in high population density, thereby increasing the range of ages not under selection.[2]/nBritish Commonwealth Scholar, 1976\u201379; NATO Science Fellow, 1979-1981, NSERC of Canada University Research Fellow, 1981\u201388; President's Prize, American Society of Naturalists, 1992; Excellence in Teaching Award, University of California, Irvine Biological Sciences, 1996; Busse Prize, World Congress of Gerontology, 1997.", "50850950": "Cinzia Verde is an Italian researcher in marine biochemistry at the National Research Council (CNR), Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR).[1][2][3]/nVerde received her Degree (equivalent to a PhD) in Biological Sciences cum laude from the University of Naples in 1987./nVerde is a Senior Researcher at the National Research Council (CNR), Institute of Biosciences and BioResources (IBBR) as a marine biochemist leading the CNR research area \u201cPolar Biology\u201d.[1][2] She is  Managing Editor of the Journal Marine Genomics[4] and a member of the Editorial Board of Biodiversity.[5]/nVerde researches the biological processes and evolution of prokaryotes and eukaryotes from polar ecosystems.

The second approach relied primarily on radioautography, and involved experiments on intact animals or pancreatic slices which were carried out in collaboration with Lucien Caro and especially James Jamieson.

His parents were Anna (Uelsmann) and Gustav Hillemann, and he was their eighth child.[20] His twin sister died when he was born, and his mother died two days later.  He was raised in the nearby household of his uncle, Bob Hilleman, and worked in his youth on the family farm.  He credited much of his success to his work with chickens as a boy; since the 1930s, fertile chicken eggs had often been used to grow viruses for vaccines.[4]/nHis family belonged to the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. When he was in the eighth grade, he discovered Charles Darwin, and was caught reading On the Origin of Species in church. Later in life, he rejected religion.[21] Due to lack of funds, he almost failed to attend college.  His eldest brother interceded, and Hilleman graduated first in his class in 1941 from Montana State University with family help and scholarships.  He won a fellowship to the University of Chicago and received his doctoral degree in microbiology in 1944.[22]  His doctoral thesis was on chlamydia infections, which were then thought to be caused by a virus.  Hilleman showed that these infections were actually caused by a species of bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, that grows only inside of cells.[4]/nAfter joining E.R. Squibb & Sons (now Bristol-Myers Squibb), Hilleman developed a vaccine against Japanese B encephalitis, a disease that threatened American troops in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. As chief of the Department of Respiratory Diseases at Army Medical Center (now the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) from 1948 to 1957, Hilleman discovered the genetic changes that occur when the influenza virus mutates, known as antigenic shift and Antigenic drift, which he theorized would mean that a yearly influenza vaccination would be necessary.[2][23]/nIn 1957, Hilleman joined Merck & Co. (Kenilworth, New Jersey), as head of its new virus and cell biology research department in West Point, Pennsylvania. It was at Merck that Hilleman developed most of the forty experimental and licensed animal and human vaccines for which he is credited, working both at the laboratory bench as well as providing scientific leadership./nHilleman served on many national and international advisory boards and committees, academic, governmental and private, including the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research Program Evaluation and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the National Immunization Program.[citation needed]/nHilleman was among the first to recognize that a 1957 outbreak of influenza in Hong Kong could become a huge pandemic. Working on a hunch, after nine 14-hour days he and a colleague determined that it was a new strain of flu that could kill millions.[6][24] Forty million doses of vaccines were prepared and distributed.[25]  Although 69,000 Americans died, the pandemic could have resulted in many more deaths in the United States.  Hilleman was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal from the American military for his work. His vaccine is believed to have saved hundreds of thousands of lives.[7][16]/nIn 1968, during the Hong Kong flu pandemic, Hilleman and his team also played a key role in developing a vaccine, and nine million doses became available in 4 months.[7][26]/nHilleman was one of the vaccine pioneers to warn about the possibility that simian viruses might contaminate vaccines.[27] The best-known of these viruses is SV40, a viral contaminant of the polio vaccine, whose discovery led to the recall of Salk's vaccine in 1961 and its replacement with Albert Sabin's oral vaccine.  The contamination occurred in both vaccines at very low levels, but because the oral vaccine was ingested rather than injected, it did not result in any harm.[citation needed]/nIn 1963, his daughter Jeryl Lynn came down with the mumps.  He cultivated material from her, and used it as the basis of a mumps vaccine.  The Jeryl Lynn strain of the mumps vaccine is still used.  The strain is used in the trivalent (measles, mumps and rubella) MMR vaccine that he also developed, the first approved vaccine to incorporate multiple live virus strains. Like many other vaccines and medications of that time period, the vaccine was tested in children with intellectual disabilities who lived in group homes; this was because, given the poor hygiene and cramped quarters of their accommodations, they were at much higher risk of infectious disease.[28]/nHe and his group invented[4] a vaccine for hepatitis B by treating blood serum with pepsin, urea and formaldehyde.  This was licensed in 1981, but withdrawn in 1986 in the United States and replaced by a vaccine that was produced in yeast.  The latter vaccine is still in use.  By 2003, 150 countries were using it and the incidence of the disease in the United States in young people had decreased by 95%. Hilleman considered his work on this vaccine to be his single greatest achievement. Liver transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl said \"...controlling the hepatitis B virus scourge ranks as one of the most outstanding contributions to human health of the twentieth century...Maurice removed one of the most important obstacles to the field of organ transplantation\".[29]/nIn his later life, Hilleman advised the World Health Organization.  He retired as senior vice president of the Merck Research Labs in 1984 at its mandatory retirement age of 65.  He then directed the newly created Merck Institute for Vaccinology where he worked for the next twenty years until his death in 2005.[30]/nAt the time of his death in Philadelphia on April 11, 2005,[21] at the age of 85, Hilleman was Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia./nHilleman was a forceful man yet at the same time, modest in his claims.  None of his vaccines or discoveries are named after him.  He ran his laboratory like a military unit, and he was the one in command.  For a time, he kept a row of \"shrunken heads\" (actually fakes made by one of his children) in his office as trophies representing each of his fired employees.  He used profanity and tirades freely to drive his arguments home, and once, famously, refused to attend a mandatory \"charm school\" course intended to make Merck middle managers more civil.

He criticised the traditional natural history style of biology, including the study of evolution, as immature science, since it relied on narrative.[7]/nFor example, he wrote \"Admittedly, some hypotheses have become so well established that no one doubts them. But this does not mean that they are known to be true. We cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it, and a hypothesis does not cease to be a hypothesis when a lot of people believe it.\"[9]/nWoodger set out to play for biology the role of Robert Boyle's Sceptical Chymist, intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the Vienna Circle of logical positivists like Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist J. B. S. Haldane to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and helped to bring about the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, combining genetics, evolution, ecology and other disciplines.[7]", "34237643": "Olwen Anne Elisabeth Rasa (1940 \u2013 15 November 2020) was a British ethologist, known for her long-duration study of the social behaviour of the dwarf mongoose in Kenya.[1] She had studied aggression among coral reef fish under the pioneering ethologist Konrad Lorenz.

He was one of the most influential and widely read authors of popular science of his generation.[1] Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. In 1996, Gould was hired as the Vincent Astor Visiting Research Professor of Biology at New York University, after which he divided his time teaching between there and Harvard./nGould's most significant contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium[2] developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972.[3] The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching speciation. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.[4]/nMost of Gould's empirical research was based on the land snail genera Poecilozonites and Cerion. He also made important contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, receiving broad professional recognition for his book Ontogeny and Phylogeny.[5] In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism and proposed that science and religion should be considered two distinct fields (or \"non-overlapping magisteria\") whose authorities do not overlap.[6]/nGould was known by the general public mainly for his 300 popular essays in Natural History magazine,[7] and his numerous books written for both the specialist and non-specialist.\nIn April 2000, the US Library of Congress named him a \"Living Legend\".[8][9]/nStephen Jay Gould was born in Queens, New York, on September 10, 1941. His father Leonard was a court stenographer and a World War II veteran in the United States Navy. His mother Eleanor was an artist, whose parents were Jewish immigrants living and working in the city's Garment District.[10] Gould and his younger brother Peter were raised in Bayside, a middle-class neighborhood in the northeastern section of Queens.[11] He attended P.S. 26 elementary school and graduated from Jamaica High School.[12]/nWhen Gould was five years old his father took him to the Hall of Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History, where he first encountered Tyrannosaurus rex. \"I had no idea there were such things\u2014I was awestruck,\" Gould once recalled.[13] It was in that moment that he decided to become a paleontologist.[14]/nRaised in a secular Jewish home, Gould did not formally practice religion and preferred to be called an agnostic.[15] When asked directly if he was an agnostic in Skeptic magazine, he responded:/nIf you absolutely forced me to bet on the existence of a conventional anthropomorphic deity, of course I'd bet no. But, basically, Huxley was right when he said that agnosticism is the only honorable position because we really cannot know. And that's right. I'd be real surprised if there turned out to be a conventional God./nThough he \"had been brought up by a Marxist father\"[16] he stated that his father's politics were \"very different\" from his own.[17] In describing his own political views, he has said they \"tend to the left of center.\"[18] According to Gould the most influential political books he read were C. Wright Mills' The Power Elite and the political writings of Noam Chomsky.[18]/nWhile attending Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the early 1960s, Gould was active in the civil rights movement and often campaigned for social justice.[19] When he attended the University of Leeds as a visiting undergraduate, he organized weekly demonstrations outside a Bradford dance hall which refused to admit black people. Gould continued these demonstrations until the policy was revoked.[20] Throughout his career and writings, he spoke out against cultural oppression in all its forms, especially what he saw as the pseudoscience used in the service of racism and sexism.[21]/nInterspersed throughout his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently referred to his non-scientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained an avid New York Yankees fan throughout his life.[22] As an adult he was fond of science fiction movies, but often lamented their poor storytelling and presentation of science.[23] His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas.[24] He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and delighted in city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.[25]/nGould married artist Deborah Lee on October 3, 1965.[12] Gould met Lee while they were students together at Antioch College.[13] They had two sons, Jesse and Ethan, and were married for 30 years.[26] His second marriage in 1995 was to artist and sculptor Rhonda Roland Shearer.[12]/nIn July 1982 Gould was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, a deadly form of cancer affecting the abdominal lining (the peritoneum). This cancer is frequently found in people who have ingested or inhaled asbestos fibers, a mineral which was used in the construction of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology.[27][28] After a difficult two-year recovery, Gould published a column for Discover magazine in 1985 titled \"The Median Isn't the Message\", which discusses his reaction to reading that \"mesothelioma is incurable, with a median mortality of only eight months after discovery.\"[29] In his essay, he describes the actual significance behind this fact, and his relief upon recognizing that statistical averages are useful abstractions, and by themselves do not encompass \"our actual world of variation, shadings, and continua.\"[29]/nGould was also an advocate of medical cannabis. When undergoing his cancer treatments he smoked marijuana to help alleviate the long periods of intense and uncontrollable nausea. According to Gould, the drug had a \"most important effect\" on his eventual recovery. He later complained that he could not understand how \"any humane person would withhold such a beneficial substance from people in such great need simply because others use it for different purposes.\"[30] On August 5, 1998, Gould's testimony assisted in the successful lawsuit of HIV activist Jim Wakeford, who sued the Government of Canada for the right to cultivate, possess, and use marijuana for medical purposes.[31]/nIn February 2002, a 3-centimetre (1.2\u00a0in) lesion was found on Gould's chest radiograph, and oncologists diagnosed him with stage IV cancer. Gould died 10 weeks later on May 20, 2002, from a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung, an aggressive form of cancer which had already spread to his brain, liver, and spleen.[32] This cancer was unrelated to his previous bout of abdominal cancer in 1982.[33] He died in his home \"in a bed set up in the library of his SoHo loft, surrounded by his wife Rhonda, his mother Eleanor, and the many books he loved.\"[34]/nGould began his higher education at Antioch College, graduating with a double major in geology and philosophy in 1963.[35] During this time, he also studied at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom.[36] After completing graduate work at Columbia University in 1967 under the guidance of Norman Newell,[37] he was immediately hired by Harvard University, where he worked until the end of his life (1967\u20132002). In 1973, Harvard promoted him to professor of geology and curator of invertebrate paleontology at the institution's Museum of Comparative Zoology.[1]/nIn 1982, Harvard awarded him the title of Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology. That same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[38] In 1983, he was awarded a fellowship at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where he later served as president (1999\u20132001). The AAAS news release cited his \"numerous contributions to both scientific progress and the public understanding of science.\"[39] He also served as president of the Paleontological Society (1985\u20131986) and of the Society for the Study of Evolution (1990\u20131991).[1]/nIn 1989, Gould was elected into the body of the National Academy of Sciences. Through 1996\u20132002 Gould was Vincent Astor Visiting research professor of biology at New York University. In 2001, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year for his lifetime of work.[1] In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Darwin\u2013Wallace Medal, along with 12 other recipients. (Until 2008, this medal had been awarded every 50 years by the Linnean Society of London.[40])/nEarly in his career, Gould and his colleague Niles Eldredge developed the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which describes the rate of speciation in the fossil record as occurring relatively rapidly, which then alternates to a longer period of evolutionary stability.[3] It was Gould who coined the term \"punctuated equilibria\" though the theory was originally presented by Eldredge in his doctoral dissertation on Devonian trilobites and his article published the previous year on allopatric speciation.[41]/nAccording to Gould, punctuated equilibrium revised a key pillar \"in the central logic of Darwinian theory.\"[17] Some evolutionary biologists have argued that while punctuated equilibrium was \"of great interest to biology generally,\"[42] it merely modified neo-Darwinism in a manner that was fully compatible with what had been known before.[43]\nOther biologists emphasize the theoretical novelty of punctuated equilibrium, and argued that evolutionary stasis had been \"unexpected by most evolutionary biologists\" and \"had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology.\"[44]/nComparisons were made to George Gaylord Simpson's work in Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1941), in which he also illustrated relatively sudden changes along evolutionary lines. Simpson describes the paleontological record as being characterized by predominantly gradual change (which he termed horotely), although he also documented examples of slow (bradytely), and rapid (tachytely) rates of evolution. Punctuated equilibrium and phyletic gradualism are not mutually exclusive (as Simpson's work demonstrates), and examples of each have been documented in different lineages. The debate between these two models is often misunderstood by non-scientists, and according to Richard Dawkins has been oversold by the media.[45]\nSome critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as \"evolution by jerks\",[46]\nwhich prompted Gould to describe phyletic gradualism as \"evolution by creeps.\"[47]/nGould made significant contributions to evolutionary developmental biology,[48] especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny.[35] In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.[49]/nGould was a champion of biological constraints, internal limitations upon developmental pathways, as well as other non-selectionist forces in evolution. Rather than direct adaptations, he considered many higher functions of the human brain to be the unintended side consequence of natural selection.[50] To describe such co-opted features, he coined the term exaptation with paleontologist Elisabeth Vrba.[51] Gould believed this feature of human mentality undermines an essential premise of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.[citation needed]/nIn 1975, Gould's Harvard colleague E. O. Wilson introduced his analysis of animal behavior (including human behavior) based on a sociobiological framework that suggested that many social behaviors have a strong evolutionary basis.[52] In response, Gould, Richard Lewontin, and others from the Boston area wrote the subsequently well-referenced letter to The New York Review of Books entitled, \"Against 'Sociobiology'\". This open letter criticized Wilson's notion of a \"deterministic view of human society and human action.\"[53]/nBut Gould did not rule out sociobiological explanations for many aspects of animal behavior, and later wrote: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of inclusive fitness and kin selection to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism\u2014previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior... Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\"[54]/n/nWith Richard Lewontin, Gould wrote an influential 1979 paper entitled, \"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm\",[50]\nwhich introduced the architectural term \"spandrel\" into evolutionary biology. In architecture, a spandrel is a triangular space which exists over the haunches of an arch.[55][56] Spandrels\u2014more often called pendentives in this context\u2014are found particularly in classical architecture, especially Byzantine and Renaissance churches./nWhen visiting Venice in 1978, Gould noted that the spandrels of the San Marco cathedral, while quite beautiful, were not spaces planned by the architect. Rather the spaces arise as \"necessary architectural byproducts of mounting a dome on rounded arches.\" Gould and Lewontin thus defined \"spandrels\" in the evolutionary biology context to mean any biological feature of an organism that arises as a necessary side consequence of other features, which is not directly selected for by natural selection. Proposed examples include the \"masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive use of an umbilicus as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality.\"[57]/nIn Voltaire's Candide, Dr. Pangloss is portrayed as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that \"all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds\". Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology.[58][59][60]\nAn illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd's case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways.[61] Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay \"Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples,\" prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.[62]/nGould was criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett for using the term spandrel instead of pendentive,[63] a spandrel that curves across a right angle to support a dome. Robert Mark, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton, offered his expertise in the pages of American Scientist, noting that these definitions are often misunderstood in architectural theory. Mark concluded, \"Gould and Lewontin's misapplication of the term spandrel for pendentive perhaps implies a wider latitude of design choice than they intended for their analogy. But Dennett's critique of the architectural basis of the analogy goes even further astray because he slights the technical rationale of the architectural elements in question.\"[56]/nGould favored the argument that evolution has no inherent drive towards long-term \"progress\". Uncritical commentaries often portray evolution as a ladder of progress, leading towards bigger, faster, and smarter organisms, the assumption being that evolution is somehow driving organisms to get more complex and ultimately more like humankind. Gould argued that evolution's drive was not towards complexity, but towards diversification. Because life is constrained to begin with a simple starting point (like bacteria), any diversity resulting from this start, by random walk, will have a skewed distribution and therefore be perceived to move in the direction of higher complexity. But life, Gould argued, can also easily adapt towards simplification, as is often the case with parasites.[64]/nIn a review of Full House, Richard Dawkins approved of Gould's general argument, but suggested that he saw evidence of a \"tendency for lineages to improve cumulatively their adaptive fit to their particular way of life, by increasing the numbers of features which combine together in adaptive complexes. ... By this definition, adaptive evolution is not just incidentally progressive, it is deeply, dyed-in-the-wool, indispensably progressive.\"[65]/nGould's arguments against progress in evolutionary biology did not extend towards a notion of progress in general or notions of cultural evolution. In Full House, Gould compares two notions of progress against one another. While the first concept of progress, evolutionary progress, is argued to be invalid for a number of biological considerations, Gould permits that evolution may operate in human cultural evolution through a Lamarckian mechanism. Gould goes on to argue that the disappearance of the 0.400 batting average in baseball is paradoxically due to the inclusion of better players in the league, rather than players becoming worse over time. In his view such a process is likely reflective in a number of cultural phenomena including sports, the visual arts, and music where, unlike in biological systems, the realm of aesthetic possibilities is constrained by a \"right wall\" of human limits and aesthetic preferences.[66] Gould later goes on to state that his arguments for biological evolution should not be applied to cultural change lest they be employed by, \"so-called 'political correctness' as a doctrine that celebrates all indigenous practice, and therefore permits no distinctions, judgements, or analyses.\"[64]/nGould never embraced cladistics as a method of investigating evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils.[67] Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.[68]/nMost of Gould's empirical research pertained to land snails. He focused his early work on the Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould \"Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, and the problem of how it is that you can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form.\"[69]/nGiven Cerion's extensive geographic diversity, Gould later lamented that if Christopher Columbus had only catalogued a single Cerion it would have ended the scholarly debate about which island Columbus had first set foot on in America.[70]/nGould is one of the most frequently cited scientists in the field of evolutionary theory. His 1979 \"spandrels\" paper has been cited more than 5,000 times.[71] In Paleobiology\u2014the flagship journal of his own speciality\u2014only Charles Darwin and George Gaylord Simpson have been cited more often.[72] Gould was also a considerably respected historian of science. Historian Ronald Numbers has been quoted as saying: \"I can't say much about Gould's strengths as a scientist, but for a long time I've regarded him as the second most influential historian of science (next to Thomas Kuhn).\"[73] Gould's undergraduate course, Science B-16: History of the Earth and Life, was taught in a Harvard Science Center lecture hall with a 250 seat capacity. Science B-16 was so oversubscribed that an annual lottery was held to see which students would be allowed to enroll in the course.  If a student was denied course enrollment three times, then their fourth entry into the lottery provided them with a guaranteed seat in the class.[74]/nShortly before his death, Gould published The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating his version of modern evolutionary theory. In an interview for the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, \"In a couple of years I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals\u2014very different from my popular science writings\u2014but it is of greater consolation to me because it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life.\"[75]/nGould became widely known through his popular essays on evolution in the Natural History magazine. His essays were published in a series entitled This View of Life (a phrase from the concluding paragraph of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species) from January 1974 to January 2001, amounting to a continuous publication of 300 essays.[7] Many of his essays were reprinted in collected volumes that became bestselling books such as Ever Since Darwin and The Panda's Thumb, Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, and The Flamingo's Smile./nA passionate advocate of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, trying to communicate his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).[22]/nAlthough a self-described Darwinist, Gould's emphasis was less gradualist and reductionist than most neo-Darwinists. He fiercely opposed many aspects of sociobiology and its intellectual descendant evolutionary psychology. He devoted considerable time to fighting against creationism, creation science, and intelligent design. Most notably, Gould provided expert testimony against the equal-time creationism law in McLean v. Arkansas. Gould later developed the term \"non-overlapping magisteria\" (NOMA) to describe how, in his view, science and religion should not comment on each other's realm. Gould went on to develop this idea in some detail, particularly in the books Rocks of Ages (1999) and The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox (2003). In a 1982 essay for Natural History Gould wrote:/nOur failure to discern a universal good does not record any lack of insight or ingenuity, but merely demonstrates that nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms. Morality is a subject for philosophers, theologians, students of the humanities, indeed for all thinking people. The answers will not be read passively from nature; they do not, and cannot, arise from the data of science. The factual state of the world does not teach us how we, with our powers for good and evil, should alter or preserve it in the most ethical manner.[76]/nGould also spoke out against creationist misuse of his work and theory, especially with respect to how his theory of punctuated equilibrium relates to the presence of transitional fossils or forms:/nIt is infuriating to be quoted again and again by creationists\u2014whether through design or stupidity, I do not know\u2014as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms. Transitional forms are generally lacking at the species level but are abundant between larger groups. The evolution from reptiles to\nmammals . . . is well documented.[77]/nAn anti-evolution petition drafted by the Discovery Institute inspired the National Center for Science Education to create a pro-evolution counterpart called \"Project Steve,\" which is named in Gould's honor.[78] In 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) selected Gould for inclusion in CSI's \"Pantheon of Skeptics\" created to remember the legacy of deceased CSI fellows and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.[79]/nGould also became a noted public face of science, often appearing on television. In 1984 Gould received his own NOVA special on PBS.[80] Other appearances included interviews on CNN's Crossfire and Talkback Live,[81] NBC's The Today Show, and regular appearances on PBS's Charlie Rose show. Gould was also a guest in all seven episodes of the Dutch talk series A Glorious Accident, in which he appeared with his close friend Oliver Sacks.[82]/nGould was featured prominently as a guest in Ken Burns's PBS documentary Baseball, as well as PBS's Evolution series. Gould was also on the Board of Advisers to the influential Children's Television Workshop television show 3-2-1 Contact, where he made frequent guest appearances.[83]/nSince 2013, Gould has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.[84]/nIn 1997, he voiced a cartoon version of himself on the television series The Simpsons. In the episode \"Lisa the Skeptic\", Lisa finds a skeleton that many people believe is an apocalyptic angel. Lisa contacts Gould and asks him to test the skeleton's DNA. The fossil is discovered to be a marketing gimmick for a new mall.[85] During production, the only phrase Gould objected to was a line in the script that introduced him as the \"world's most brilliant paleontologist\".[86] In 2002, the show paid tribute to Gould after his death, dedicating the season 13 finale to his memory. Gould had died two days before the episode aired./nGould received many accolades for his scholarly work and popular expositions of natural history,[87] but a number of biologists felt his public presentations were out of step with mainstream evolutionary thinking.[88] The public debates between Gould's supporters and detractors have been so quarrelsome that they have been dubbed \"The Darwin Wars\" by several commentators.[89][90]/nJohn Maynard Smith, the eminent British evolutionary biologist, was among Gould's strongest critics. Maynard Smith thought that Gould misjudged the vital role of adaptation in biology, and was critical of Gould's acceptance of species selection as a major component of biological evolution.[91] In a review of Daniel Dennett's book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Maynard Smith wrote that Gould \"is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.\"[92] But Maynard Smith was not consistently negative, writing in a review of The Panda's Thumb that \"Stephen Gould is the best writer of popular science now active... Often he infuriates me, but I hope he will go right on writing essays like these.\"[93] Maynard Smith was also among those who welcomed Gould's reinvigoration of evolutionary paleontology.[43]/nOne reason for criticism was that Gould appeared to be presenting his ideas as a revolutionary way of understanding evolution, and argued for the importance of mechanisms other than natural selection, mechanisms which he believed had been ignored by many professional evolutionists. As a result, many non-specialists sometimes inferred from his early writings that Darwinian explanations had been proven to be unscientific (which Gould never tried to imply). Along with many other researchers in the field, Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists as \"proof\" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved.[94] Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.[95]/nThe conflicts between Richard Dawkins and Gould were popularized by philosopher Kim Sterelny in his 2001 book Dawkins vs. Gould. Sterelny documents their disagreements over theoretical issues, including the prominence of gene selection in evolution. Dawkins argues that natural selection is best understood as competition among genes (or replicators), while Gould advocated multi-level selection, which includes selection amongst genes, nucleic acid sequences, cell lineages, organisms, demes, species, and clades.[90]/nDawkins accused Gould of deliberately underplaying the differences between rapid gradualism and macromutation in his published accounts of punctuated equilibrium.[96] He also devoted entire chapters to critiquing Gould's account of evolution in his books The Blind Watchmaker and Unweaving the Rainbow, as did Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea. Other biologists contemporary to Gould went further, as in the case of Robert Trivers who classified it as \"intellectual fraud\".[97]/nIn his book Wonderful Life (1989) Gould famously described the Cambrian fauna of the Burgess Shale, emphasizing their bizarre anatomical designs, their sudden appearance, and the role chance played in determining which members survived. He used the Cambrian fauna as an example of the role contingency has in shaping the broader pattern of evolution./nHis view of contingency was criticized by Simon Conway Morris in his 1998 book The Crucible of Creation.[98] Conway Morris stressed members of the Cambrian fauna that resemble modern taxa. He also argued that convergent evolution has a tendency to produce \"similarities of organization\" and that the forms of life are restricted and channelled. In his book Life's Solution (2003) Conway Morris argued that the appearance of human-like animals is also likely.[99] Paleontologist Richard Fortey noted that prior to the release of Wonderful Life, Conway Morris shared a similar thesis to Gould's, but after Wonderful Life Conway Morris revised his interpretation and adopted a more deterministic position on the history of life.[100]/nPaleontologists Derek Briggs and Richard Fortey have also argued that much of the Cambrian fauna may be regarded as stem groups of living taxa,[101] though this is still a subject of intense research and debate, and the relationship of many Cambrian taxa to modern phyla has not been established in the eyes of many palaeontologists.[102]/nRichard Dawkins disagrees with the view that new phyla suddenly appeared in the Cambrian, arguing that for a new phylum \"to spring into existence, what actually has to happen on the ground is that a child is born which suddenly, out of the blue, is as different from its parents as a snail is from an earthworm. No zoologist who thinks through the implications, not even the most ardent saltationist, has ever supported any such notion.\"[103] In the Structure of Evolutionary Theory Gould stresses the difference between phyletic splitting and large anatomical transitions, noting that the two events may be separated by millions of years. Gould argues that no paleontologist regards the Cambrian explosion \"as a genealogical event\u2014that is as the actual time of initial splitting\", but rather it \"marks an anatomical transition in the overt phenotypes of bilaterian organisms.\"[104]/nGould also had a long-running public feud with E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary biologists concerning the disciplines of human sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, both of which Gould and Lewontin opposed, but which Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Steven Pinker advocated.[105] These debates reached their climax in the 1970s, and included strong opposition from groups such as the Sociobiology Study Group and Science for the People.[106] Pinker accuses Gould, Lewontin, and other opponents of evolutionary psychology of being \"radical scientists\", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science.[107] Gould stated that he made \"no attribution of motive in Wilson's or anyone else's case\" but cautioned that all human beings are influenced, especially unconsciously, by our personal expectations and biases. He wrote:/nI grew up in a family with a tradition of participation in campaigns for social justice, and I was active, as a student, in the civil rights movement at a time of great excitement and success in the early 1960s. Scholars are often wary of citing such commitments. \u2026 [but] it is dangerous for a scholar even to imagine that he might attain complete neutrality, for then one stops being vigilant about personal preferences and their influences\u2014and then one truly falls victim to the dictates of prejudice. Objectivity must be operationally defined as fair treatment of data, not absence of preference.[108]/nGould's primary criticism held that human sociobiological explanations lacked evidential support, and argued that adaptive behaviors are frequently assumed to be genetic for no other reason than their supposed universality, or their adaptive nature. Gould emphasized that adaptive behaviors can be passed on through culture as well, and either hypothesis is equally plausible.[109] Gould did not deny the relevance of biology to human nature, but reframed the debate as \"biological potentiality vs. biological determinism.\" Gould stated that the human brain allows for a wide range of behaviors. Its flexibility \"permits us to be aggressive or peaceful, dominant or submissive, spiteful or generous\u2026 Violence, sexism, and general nastiness are biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviors. But peacefulness, equality, and kindness are just as biological\u2014and we may see their influence increase if we can create social structures that permit them to flourish.\"[109]/nGould was the author of The Mismeasure of Man (1981), a history and inquiry of psychometrics and intelligence testing, generating perhaps the greatest controversy of all his books and receiving both widespread praise[110] and extensive criticism.[111][112][113] Gould investigated the methods of nineteenth century craniometry, as well as the history of psychological testing. Gould wrote that both theories developed from an unfounded belief in biological determinism, the view that \"social and economic differences between human groups\u2014primarily races, classes, and sexes\u2014arise from inherited, inborn distinctions and that society, in this sense, is an accurate reflection of biology.\"[114] The book was reprinted in 1996 with the addition of a new foreword and a critical review of The Bell Curve./nIn 2011, a study conducted by six anthropologists criticized Gould's claim that Samuel Morton unconsciously manipulated his skull measurements, arguing that his analysis of Morton was influenced by his opposition to racism.[115][116][117]  The group's paper was reviewed in an editorial in the journal Nature, which pointed out that the paper's authors might have been influenced by their own motivations, recommending a degree of caution, stating \"the critique leaves the majority of Gould's work unscathed,\" and noted that \"because they couldn't measure all the skulls, they do not know whether the average cranial capacities that Morton reported represent his sample accurately.[118] The journal stated that Gould's opposition to racism may have biased his interpretation of Morton's data, but also noted that \"Lewis and his colleagues have their own motivations. Several in the group have an association with the University of Pennsylvania, to whom Morton donated his collection of skulls, and have an interest in seeing the valuable but understudied skull collection freed from the stigma of bias and did not accept Gould's theory \"that the scientific method is inevitably tainted by bias.\"[118]/nIn 2014, the group's paper was critically reviewed in the journal Evolution & Development by University of Pennsylvania philosopher professor Michael Weisberg, who tended to support Gould's original accusations, concluding that \"there is prima facie evidence of a racial bias in Morton's measurements\". Weisberg concludes that although Gould did make several errors and overstated his case in a number of places, Morton's work \"remains a cautionary example of racial bias in the science of human differences\".[119] In 2015, biologists and philosophers Jonathan Kaplan, Massimo Pigliucci, and Joshua Banta published an article arguing that no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from Morton's data. They agreed with Gould, and disagreed with the 2011 study, insofar as Morton's study was seriously flawed, but they agreed with the 2011 study insofar as Gould's analysis was in many ways not better than Morton's.[120] University of Pennsylvania anthropology doctoral student Paul Wolff Mitchell published an analysis of Morton's original, unpublished data, which neither Gould nor subsequent commentators had directly addressed. Mitchell concluded that Gould's specific argument about Morton's unconscious bias in measurement is not supported, but that it was true, as Gould had claimed, that Morton's racial biases influenced how he reported and interpreted his measurements, arguing that Morton's interpretation of his data was arbitrary and tendentious: Morton investigated averages and ignored variations in skull size so large that there was significant overlap.[121] A contemporary of Morton, Friedrich Tiedemann, had collected almost identical skull data and drawn conclusions opposite to Morton's on the basis of this overlap, arguing strongly against any conception of a racial hierarchy.[122][123]/nIn his book Rocks of Ages (1999), Gould put forward what he described as \"a blessedly simple and entirely conventional resolution to ... the supposed conflict between science and religion.\"[124] He defines the term magisterium as \"a domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution.\"[124] The non-overlapping magisteria (NOMA) principle therefore divides the magisterium of science to cover \"the empirical realm: what the Universe is made of (fact) and why does it work in this way (theory). The magisterium of religion extends over questions of ultimate meaning and moral value. These two magisteria do not overlap, nor do they encompass all inquiry.\"[124] He suggests that \"NOMA enjoys strong and fully explicit support, even from the primary cultural stereotypes of hard-line traditionalism\" and that NOMA is \"a sound position of general consensus, established by long struggle among people of goodwill in both magisteria.\"[124]/nThis view has not been without criticism, however. In his book The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins argues that the division between religion and science is not so simple as Gould claims, as few religions exist without claiming the existence of miracles, which \"by definition violate the principles of science.\"[125] Dawkins also opposes the idea that religion has anything meaningful to say about ethics and values, and therefore has no authority to claim a magisterium of its own.[125] He goes on to say that he believes Gould is \"bending over backwards to be nice to an unworthy but powerful opponent\".[126] Similarly, humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz argues that Gould was wrong to posit that science has nothing to say about questions of ethics. In fact, Kurtz claims that science is a much better method than religion for determining moral principles.[127]/nGould's publications were numerous. One review of his publications between 1965 and 2000 noted 479 peer-reviewed papers, 22 books, 300 essays,[10] and 101 \"major\" book reviews.[1]/nThe following is a list of books either written or edited by Stephen Jay Gould, including those published posthumously, after his death in 2002.

With Huxley, he started working on an actin/myosin/ATP model for molecular motors,[4][5] proposing that myosin would ratchet actin and exert a stroke.[6] Spudich first attempted to create an in vitro setup with actin and myosin. However, he faced great difficulty aligning actin filaments.[3] In 1982 he and Michael Sheetz started to work on the alga Nitella, which has long oriented actin fibers, and observed myosin coated beads moving along actin filaments.[7] This provided strong clues about the molecular transport of intracellular cargo, later refined to observing a single step of a single myosin molecule.[8]  His research and its place in the overal development of the motility field has been described in a number of well-cited review articles.[9][10][11]/nHe started at UCSF and then came to Stanford as a professor of Structural biology in 1977.

Considered politically, Enchmen's philosophy is an example of \u2033vulgar materialism\u2033, a term often used by Marxist detractors. It was pejoratively called Enchmenism, especially when coupled and contrasted with the Mininism of Sergey Konstantinovich Minin and Deborinism of Abram Deborin./nEmmanuil was born in 1891 in the Georgian town of Tbilisi into the family of a Jewish timekeeper employed by a construction company. From 1910, Enchmen studied at the St. Petersburg Psycho-Neurological Institute, receiving a degree in biology in 1914. In 1913 he met Ivan Pavlov. Leon Orbeli recalled that Pavlov told him in 1920 that Enchmen \"was my best friend from the year 1913.\"[2]/nEnchman was drafted into the Russian Imperial Army in 1914, but following the February Revolution of 1917 he joined the Red Army, becoming a member of the Russian Communist Party in 1919,[2] although previously he had been a Socialist Revolutionary.[3] During the Russian Civil War, he applied his knowledge of English and German to agitate amongst foreign troops, and attained the rank of Senior Politruk.[2] He became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mikhail Tskhakaya, who sent him to Lenin with a personal letter of introduction. Despite being captured en route, he escaped and delivered the letter.[2]/nWhen Pavlov requested to be allowed to emigrate in September 1920, Lenin sent Enchman to see Pavlov. Enchman sent a report to Mikhail Pokrovsky outlining the inadequacy of Pavlov's working circumstances. This was forwarded to Lenin who issued a decree on February 11, 1921, which provided Pavlov with the material aid he needed.[2]/nIn 1923, Nikolai Bukharin declared Enchmen's theory incompatible with what the Bolshevik regime regarded as Marxism, and Enchmen's reputation collapsed. It was only in 1990 that some of his material was republished in Russia. However, he had gained the attention of Gregory Razran,[2] a Russian American psychologist who viewed Pavlovian psychology as being incompatible with Marxism-Leninism.[4] In the years after, Enchmen held administrative positions but continued writing on issues related to Marxist philosophy. Following Buharin's fall from power and subsequent execution, Tskhakaya contacted Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev, a member of the politburo, to see if Enchman could recommence with his scientific interests, however this was declined by Stalin.[2]/nEnchmen rejoined the Red Army with the rank of Senior Politruk, after the USSR was invaded by Germany. However, he was discharged in 1942 for health reasons. On January 16, 1943, he was given the position of a senior scientist at the Biological Section of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, and on October 13, 1948, he was transferred to the Biophysical Section of the Pavlov Institute of Physiology.[2]/nHis Theory of New Biology was expressed in his unpublished 1913 text 'Psychology before the tribunal of reborn positivism' (Russian: \u041f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043c, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430). This primarily dealt with methodology./nFirstly, Enchman makes a distinction between physical/material and psychological/conscious phenomena:/nThe introspective person is aware of their own conscious experiences, but this cannot directly experience by any other person. However, a second observer can report on the overt activity, or behaviour, of the introspecting person. The scientific method is concerned with attempts to establish relationships among the observed phenomena of the physical/material realm, whilst ignoring any parallel psychological/conscious experiences.

Nature's Services starts off with an introduction from Daily titled \"What are Ecosystem Services\" and another introductory piece by Harold Mooney and Paul Ehrlich that seeks to detail the \"fragmentary history\" of ecosystem services. After the introductions, the book is split into four distinct sections that address different elements of ecosystem services./nThe first section of the book address the economic issues involved in assigning value to ecosystem services in the first place. The next two sections outline different kinds of services that can be provided by nature, \"Overarching Services\" and \"Services Supplied by Major Biomes.\" The overarching services section includes papers like \"Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning\" by David Tilman,[20] \"Ecosystem Services Supplied by Soil\" by Daily, Pamela Matson and Peter Vitousek[21]  and \"Services Provided by Pollinators\" by Gary Nabhan and Stephen Buchmann[22] The \"Services Provided by Major Biomes\" section includes papers regarding topics like \"Marine Ecosystems\" by Charles Peterson and Jane Lubchenco[23] and \"The World's Forests and their Ecosystem Services\" by Norman Myers[24]/nThe last section of the book includes case studies which showcase different services that distinct ecosystems provide to people around the world. Examples include: \"Water Quality Improvements by Wetlands\" by Katherine Ewel[25] and \"Ecosystem Services in a Modern Economy: Gunnison County, Colorado\" by Andrew Wilcox and John Harte.[26] In the conclusion of the book, Daily remarks that the \"core analyses presented in this book attempt to value ecosystems and their component species only insofar as they confer benefits, in the form of life-support goods and services, to human beings\" but that this \"focus does not in any way preclude making decisions on the basis of other values as well.\"[27]/nIn his review of the book, James Salzman concluded that Nature's Services, in contrast with efforts like the Endangered Species Act, \"takes a different, potentially more effective tack, calling for explicit recognition of ecosystem services because of the direct, tangible benefits they provide. Such recognition could provide a more integrated and compelling basis for action than those suggested by a single-species or biodiversity protection for the simple reason that the impacts of those services on humans are more immediate and undeniably important.\"[28]/nThe New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable was co-written by Daily and Katherine Ellison and was published in 2002 by Island Press. The book presents different cases studies where companies or governments were able to actually profit from their conservation efforts. One chapter describes how New York \"decided to meet federal requirements to improve\nwater quality with a less expensive, though more controversial, option of protecting watershed integrity through land purchases and development limits, rather than adopt the technological solution of a multibillion dollar treatment facility.\"[29] While another chapter offers \"an assessment of plans to manage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by developing a worldwide system of carbon trading patterned on the U.S. experience with pollution.\"[29]/nKenneth Arrow remarked that Daily and Ellison \"have delineated the new movement to make conservation of natural resources financially rewarding and illustrate in a lively and probing manner many cases of profitable activities that also preserve the biosphere.\"[29]/nIn his review of the book, Patrick Wilson stated that \"The most notable contribution of The New Economy of Nature is its balanced message, optimistic and cautious.\" He goes on to say that the book \"avoids the fallacy that the market is the solution to our environmental protection challenges and that, if allowed to operate free of government intervention, it can somehow make the policymaking choices less problematic and the tradeoffs less daunting\" and that \"it challenges elements of environmental orthodoxy that hold that the market, because of its short-term orientation and emphasis on profit over conservation, is an intrinsic threat to nature and the only solution is increased government oversight and financial commitment.\"[30]/nGreen Growth That Works: Natural Capital Policy and Finance Mechanisms from Around the World was published in 2019 by Island Press.[31]/nDaily has received numerous prestigious awards and honors throughout her academic career, including the 21st Century Scientist Award (2000), The Sophie Prize (2008), The International Cosmos Prize (2009), The 16th Annual Heinz Award with special focus on global change, the Midori Prize (2010), the Volvo Environment Prize (2012), the Blue Planet Prize (2017), and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement (2020).[5][32][33][34][35] She has received the 2018 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of Ecology and Conservation Biology, jointly with Georgina Mace for developing vital tools facilitating science-based policies \u201cto combat species loss.\u201d[36]/nDaily has authored, coauthored and/or edited five books.

He became an international expert on lakes and wrote the four-volume Treatise on Limnology in 1957.[4]/nHutchinson earned his degree in zoology from Cambridge University but chose not to earn a doctorate, of which he came to be proud as he aged.[5] Although born in England, he spent nearly his entire professional life at Yale University in the United States where he was Sterling Professor of Zoology and focused on working with graduate students.[6]/nHutchinson was born in 1903 to Arthur and Evaline D. Hutchinson.[7] He grew up in Cambridge, England. His father was a mineralogist at the University of Cambridge. Hutchinson grew up surrounded by intellectuals, including two of Darwin's sons. By the age of five, Hutchinson was already collecting aquatic creatures and studying their preferred living environment in aquariums that he manufactured himself.[6] He had a younger brother and a younger sister.[7] He had his early education at Saint Faith's.[8]  He went on in 1917 to study at  Gresham's School in Norfolk.[6] Gresham's was unique in not focusing on the classics, but including more intensive studies of mathematics and science, along with modern languages and history.[9]  It was here that he began to notice that organisms had different chemical environments.[10] Hutchinson was admitted to read zoology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating in 1925.[11]/nHutchinson married three times. His first wife was Grace Pickford. Grace was also Cambridge educated, she became a well known scientist as well. They were married from 1931 to 1933, when they agreed to a divorce.[12]\nHe met his second wife, Margaret Seal, while on a boat returning to England from India. She was a musician and they shared an appreciation for music, literature, and art. They were married for fifty years, with no children. She died of Alzheimer's in 1983. Hutchinson's third marriage occurred while he was into his eighties to Anne Twitty, a biologist of Haitian descent.[13] He survived all three of his wives and died in London, May 17, 1991.[14]/nAfter graduating, he went to Italy to study octopuses. Next he travelled to South Africa where he discovered the field of limnology or the study of freshwater systems, on the shallow lakes near Cape Town.[15] He took a position teaching zoology at Yale University in 1928. He travelled widely, reaching underexplored parts of the world and writing his first book on the ecology of high-elevation lakes in India. At Yale  his graduate students influenced him to research new areas.[16]/nAt the age of twenty-two, on graduating from Cambridge, Hutchinson traveled to Italy on a Rockefeller Higher Education Fellowship to work at the Stazione Zoologica. He was interested in doing research on the branchial gland of the octopus. He wanted to establish endocrine function in higher invertebrates. He thought that the branchial gland was the endocrine gland in the octopus, but an octopus shortage put an end to his research. He returned to Italy many times for Italian art, folklore, and to study his Italian ancestry.[17]/nIn 1926 he applied for a lectureship at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. He lectured for two years before he was fired, but he continued to study the South African water bugs. When he began his research there were fourteen known species and when he concluded his research there were nearly forty. It was here that Hutchinson discovered limnology, or the study of fresh waters. Along with Grace Pickford,  he studied the chemistry and biology of the coastal lakes. He was greatly interested in limnology due to it combining of all his interests such as natural history, aquatic invertebrates, and chemistry. He was drawn to the differences in the chemistry, flora, and fauna in the different water sources.[18] While in South Africa in the late 1920s he frequently visited the southeastern portion of the country, in particular conducting biology and chemistry research in Morgans Bay and St Lucia, he also spent a lot of time around the Sani Pass and the Drakensberg Mountains as well as the area around Royal Natal National Park. He became somewhat of a minor celebrity in Natal during this time.[19]/nIn 1932 Hutchinson joined the Yale North India Expedition. He wanted to be the first to make ecological observations of a high-altitude lake, and to compare these with lower-altitude lakes.  The work yielded insights into biogeography and new data on high elevation limnology. Most lakes had no fish, and crustaceans were the top predators. In letters to his wife, he described the  different water chemistry from the Indian lakes to the South African lakes.[20] He collected hundreds of specimens for analysis by specialists. This expedition provided the material for his first book, The Clear Mirror, in which he described the colors, organisms, ecology, and the people of the Ladakh.[21]/nMost of Hutchinson's contributions to American limnology came from research at Linsley Pond in Connecticut. Studies were done on small lakes, such as chemical stratification, oxygen deficits, productivity, and the ecological significance of the oxidation-reduction potential of lake waters. His four volume Treatise on Limnology became a standard for limnology students. Hutchinson expanded the field of limnology, especially in its ecological and biogeochemical aspects. He advocated the use of statistical and mathematical methods in limnology.[22] His postdoctoral associate Raymond Lindeman furthered Hutchinson's model of the trophic dynamic concept. Together they looked at energy flows through the lake in the trophic levels of ecosystems.[23] They followed the energy using Hutchinson's notation system in which each organism was given an integer to mark how many organisms the energy had to go through in order to reach it, this was designated as its trophic level. It then became possible to measure the efficiency of a given system, or the energy losses between ascending trophic levels.[3]/nHutchinson is also recognized as being the first to use radioisotopes as tracers in field experiments. In doing so he along with his graduate student Vaughan Bowen, are credited with creating Radiation Ecology, a brand new major field of ecology. He again turned to Linsley Pond, he released twenty-four portions in two lines and dispersed it uniformly across the water, a week later they collected water across different depths in the lake. They then evaporated and measured the radioactivity, what they found they deemed to be statistically significant. The rest was found to have been taken up by the aquatic plants in the shallow water area of the lake.[24]/nHutchinson and his graduate students intellectualized American ecology by \"forcing its practitioners to confront all of the processes that maintain to change ecological systems, whether these processes were biological, physical or geological\".[3] He built on Charles Elton's idea of an ecological niche. He defined it as \"a highly abstract multi-dimensional hyperspace in which the organism's needs and properties were defined as dimensions.\"[3] Hutchinson created the idea of \"Circular Causal Systems\", the tight link between biological and physical processes, and that the activity of organisms balanced the effects on the cycles of chemicals through organisms. He said that the changes in biological productivity were related to the changes of available nutrients. He stated that the condition in which organisms existed were systems of feedback loops. In his systems view, there were both living and non-living feedback systems which followed the same mechanical principles. This led to the development of systems ecology by his student H.T. Odum.[23]/nDue to Hutchinson, the European attitudes towards ecology entered America. Before Hutchinson, ecology and natural history were considered identical. After Hutchinson it became legitimate to study the physical and chemical properties of ecosystems in their own right. Hutchinson also raised the idea of climate change 30 years before the problem became popular. He taught his students as early as 1947 that the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide would lead to a global temperature increase. He considered the causes and preventatives for extinction, resource management, and the social anthropology of endangered cultures decades before they were attracting attention as crises.[3] He influenced many different areas of ecology, contributing to his designation as the \"Father of Modern Ecology\". His many graduate students went on to careers in ecology.[25] He was the first to describe and resolve the paradox of the plankton in 1961.[26] Upon his death, Yvette H. Edmondson noted \"The era that ended with G.E. Hutchinson's death was not only that of a thoughtful man and the growth of a science imprinted by his thinking. Even more sadly, we may be seeing the end of an intellectual climate in which the sparking mind of one individual can so illuminate a science. Science by committee casts a very different light.\"[27] In 1982, the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, now called the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, honored Hutchinson by creating the G. Evelyn Hutchinson Award, one of the Society's major awards that is given annually to recognize excellence in any aspect of limnology or oceanography.[27]/nHutchinson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1949,[28]  the National Academy of Sciences in 1950,[29] and the American Philosophical Society in 1956.[30] He was awarded the 1952 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.[31] He was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1984.[32] He was elected to the Royal Society in 1983, awarded the Kyoto Prize in 1986, and posthumously the National Medal of Science in 1991.", "48590173": "Order of Mapungubwe, 2007/nValerie Mizrahi FRS (born 1958) is a South African molecular biologist.[1]/nThe daughter of Morris and Etty Mizrahi, she was born in Harare, Zimbabwe and was educated there.

B. van Niel, he made important contributions to the taxonomy of bacteria, including the classification of blue-green algae as cyanobacteria.[2] In 1957, he and co-authors wrote The Microbial World, an influential microbiology textbook which was published in five editions over three decades.[3] In the course of 24 years at the University of California, Berkeley he reached the rank of professor and served as chair of the Department of Bacteriology before leaving for the Pasteur Institute in 1971.[4] He received several awards over the course of his career, including the Leeuwenhoek Medal. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences and the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur.[1]/nRoger Yate Stanier was born to British immigrant parents on 22 October 1916 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.[4] His father studied medicine at the University of Toronto and later established a private practice in diagnostic radiology. His mother, a teacher, studied English literature at the University of Cambridge./nHis early education was at private boarding schools. Beginning at age 7 he attended St. Christopher's School in Victoria, British Columbia for two years, followed by what Stanier described as \"five long and hellish years\" at Shawnigan Lake School.[5] His father removed him from Shawnigan after he contracted pneumonia, upon his recovery he attended Oak Bay High School until his graduation in 1931 at the age of 15.[5] He then enrolled at the local junior college, Victoria College, where he studied biology, literature, and history.[6] He subsequently transferred to the University of British Columbia (UBC) with the intention to study literature and history. His parents demurred, however, so he settled on bacteriology in order to placate his physician father, ultimately graduating with first-class Honours in bacteriology in 1936.[5]/nBecause he felt he had had insufficient exposure to the physical sciences at UBC he sought chemistry training at the University of Munich in 1936.[5] The rise of Nazism had poisoned the environment at the university, so he cut short his studies there and decided to attend graduate school in the United States.[6]/nOn account of the presence of his friend, Mike Lerner, he chose to enroll in the Department of Bacteriology of the University of California, Berkeley, but he found himself uninterested by the phage research done under A.P. Krueger, and he subsequently accepted a teaching assistantship at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) for the 1938\u20131939 term, his first paid employment.[5] During his time at UCLA, he attended the famous summer course taught by C. B. van Niel at the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. His experience there drove his decision to pursue general microbiology. After receiving his M.A. from UCLA in 1939 he returned to Pacific Grove as van Niel's student.[4]/nAfter his graduation he worked with Marjory Stephenson at the University of Cambridge as a Guggenheim fellow beginning in 1945./nUpon his return to the United States he served a short appointment at the University of Indiana./nIn 1946-1947 we had at Indiana Roger Stanier, a marvelous teacher of bacterial biochemistry, a superb lecturer, and an arrogant uncompromising intellectual.

As in Dante\u2019s Inferno Farinata was contemptuous of Hell, so did Roger hold all of Indiana in contempt. From him I began to learn that biochemistry was not just chemistry, but biology. I learned about the power  of an integrated view of metabolism and of the subtle interplay between organisms and their environment. Most important, I learned that bacteriology could be as much fun as genetics, if of a different kind of fun.[7]/nIn 1947 he accepted an invitation to join the Department of Bacteriology of the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for most of his career.[4]/nIn 1971 he left Berkeley and moved to Paris, where he worked at the Institut Pasteur for the last decade of his life.[8] He described the reasons for his departure as both academic and political: academic disruptions amid the campus turmoil associated with the Free Speech Movement, then governor Ronald Reagan's ouster of University of California president Clark Kerr, and the election of President Richard Nixon.[5] Along with his wife Germaine, he accepted the invitation of \u00c9lie Wollman to take over the former lab space of Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and Jacques Monod, with the stipulation that he be allowed to work on cyanobacteria exclusively.[5][9] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978.[10]/nStanier's research career included a diverse variety of research problems bound by a desire to synthesize the general and specific patterns observed in bacteria into a more unified understanding of biology as a whole.[11] Together with C. B. van Niel, Stanier was described by Carl Woese as one of the \"only consistently insightful and articulate reporters of the early search for a microbial phylogeny\".[12] Stanier participated in Bergey's Manual Trust during its conception.[1] He invented the technique of simultaneous adaption for the analysis of metabolic pathways.[13]/nStanier's work on Cyanobacteria focused on obligate autotrophy, fatty acid composition, structure of phycobiliproteins and phycobilisomes, chromatic adaptation, nitrogen fixation, and their nutrition and taxonomy.[11] He led the proposal to include cyanobacteria, which he called blue-green algae or cyanophytes, within the bacteria rather than consider the cyanobacteria as distinct from bacteria.[14][15]/nStanier also authored an influential textbook, The Microbial World.[1][3] The Microbial World played an important role in the promulgation of the concepts of \"prokaryote\" and \"eukaryote\" as negative definitions of Bacteria and Archea.[2][16]", "49507692": "Richard Bruce \"Dick\" Root (7 September 1936 \u2013 22 January 2013) was a professor of evolutionary biology, ecology and entomology.[2] He was an important contributor to the field of ecology, and is best known for introducing the concept of the ecological \u201cguild\u201d.[2] This concept is found in his doctoral research paper focused on defining the ecological niche and comparing the niche dimensions of the blue-grey gnatcatcher with other insectivorous bird species.[2][3]/nRoot completed his undergraduate and honours degrees at the University of Michigan, before moving to University of California, Berkeley to complete his PhD research.[1] Root's first scientific article was published in 1960, based on his honours research on flatworm demography.[1] His doctoral thesis, titled \u201cNiche organization in the Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea)\u201d, was completed in 1964 and later published in Ecological Monographs in 1967.[3] The concept of ecological guilds established in this paper has become a highly influential in ecology.[2] His research later shifted focus from insectivorous birds to focusing on the insects themselves (Cornell University memorials 2013). His research in later years concentrated mostly on trends in the traits, functions, and affinities of the arthropods associated with goldenrods (especially tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima).[4]/nBy 2003, Root had supervised 33 Ph.D. students and 4 master's students, who sometimes described themselves as \"Rootlets\".[5] In the final seven years of his life, Root experienced a gradual decline in his mental and physical abilities due to a degenerative disease, but continued to be involved in science, visiting Cornell University regularly, attending lunch meetings and visiting field sites.[1] He died on January 22, 2013, and was survived by his wife Barbara, two children and two stepchildren through his marriage to Barbara.[1]/nIn 1962, while a graduate student, Root won the A. Brazier Howell Award of the Cooper Ornithological Society.[1] Throughout his career, he received many prestigious awards, including the Eminent Ecologist Award (2003) and Eugene P. Odum Award (2004), both presented by the Ecological Society of America.[1][5] In 2003, he received the Edgerton Career Teaching Award from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University.[1][4]", "31354222": "Ronald J. Konopka (1947-2015) was an American geneticist who studied chronobiology.[1]  He made his most notable contribution to the field while working with Drosophila in the lab of Seymour Benzer at the California Institute of Technology. During this work, Konopka discovered the period (per) gene, which controls the period of circadian rhythms.[2][3]/nRon Konopka received his Ph.D. in Biology from the California Institute of Technology in 1972. In 1975, following his discovery of the period mutants, Konopka was awarded a faculty position at the California Institute of Technology. While there, Konopka's colleagues were critical of his reluctance to publish his work on the period gene, and Konopka was denied tenure. After his stay at Caltech, Konopka accepted a position at Clarkson University but was again denied tenure and subsequently exited the field of science.[4] Konopka's career, interwoven with the work of his mentor, Seymour Benzer, and the other scientists working in Benzer's lab is narrated in Time, Love, Memory by Jonathan Weiner./nKonopka's discovery and genetic analysis of period and several other circadian rhythm mutations became the basis of the research done by  Drs. Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young, who were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine./nAs a graduate student in Seymour Benzer's lab, Konopka sought to use Benzer's method of behavioral genetics to unravel the mysteries of the \"master clock\" that existed in every organism.[5] He used ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) to induce point mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, and eventually isolated three mutants with abnormal rhythms in eclosion. He mapped the mutations to the same location on the far left of the X chromosome, less than 1 centimorgan away from the white gene locus. These mutations were alternative alleles of a gene that Konopka subsequently named period.[6] While wild type flies have a circadian period around 24 hours, Konopka found the per01 mutant was arrhythmic, the perS mutant had a period of 19 hours, and the perL had a period of 29 hours./nIn 1979 and a 1980, Konopka and Dominic Orr tested whether mutations in per mutations affected the period of the entire circadian cycle or just a portion of it. By comparing the light responses of perS eclosion rhythm to that of wild type flies, Konopka and Orr found that light pulses reset the mutant clock to a greater extent than the wild type clock (about 10 hours for perS compared to 3 hours for wild type flies). They also observed that the while duration of the light-sensitive part of the day (subjective night) was found to be similar between perS and wild type flies, the duration of the light-insensitive part of the cycle (subjective day) was 5 hours shorter in mutant flies than in wild type flies. They concluded that differences in period length between mutant and wild type flies could be accounted for by a shortening of the subjective day, or the active part of the circadian cycle, in perS mutants. From this, Konopka concluded that separate molecular processes correspond to the subjective night and subjective day and that the perS allele acts by shortening the subjective day while leaving the subjective night unchanged. Based on these findings, Konopka and Orr constructed a model for the action of the per gene. The oscillation is interpreted in terms of a membrane gradient that is established during the subjective day and dissipates during the subjective night. The model predicts that the per gene product is active during the subjective day and functions like a pump to establish the gradient. Once a high threshold is reached, the pump shuts off and light-sensitive channels open to dissipate the gradient. A light pulse during the subjective night closes the channels and starts the pump; the value of the gradient when the channels close is the same as the value when the pump starts, and thus a reset in the cycle is produced and an oscillation results.[7]  This model has been replaced with a transcription translation negative feedback model involving timeless, clock, and cycle.[8]/nAlso in 1980, Konopka and Steven Wells reported an abnormality in the morphology of a neurosecretory cell group associated with the arrhythmic per01 mutation and with 2 arrhythmic mutants of another fly strain, Drosophila pseudoobscura. This cell group normally consists of four clustered cells in either side of the brain, roughly halfway between the top and bottom edge, in the posterior area of the brain. Cells in this cluster are occasionally located abnormally near the top edge, rather than the middle, of the brain at a rate of about 17% of cells in wild-type D. melanogaster. The per01 mutation significantly increases the percentage of abnormally located cells to about 40%. In two aperiodic strains of D. pseudoobscura, the percentages of abnormally located cells are likewise significantly increased over those in the wild type. Konopka inferred from the results that neurosecretory cells may be part of the Drosophila circadian system and that per gene product may influence the development of these cells.[9]/nIn 1979 Konopka worked with Alfred Handler to discover the nature behind pacemaker signalling by transplanting brains of donor flies into abdomens of arrhythmic host flies. They found that circadian rhythms in host flies were restored with the period of the donor; for example, short period (perS) adult brains implanted into the abdomens of arrhythmic (per01) hosts could confer a short period rhythm on the activity of some hosts for at least 4 cycles.[10] Since the transplanted brains were unable to create new neuronal connections to locomotor activity centers, Konopka and Handler concluded that pacemaker signalling for locomotion must be humoral and not neuronal.[10]/nWhile at Clarkson College, Konopka continued his work with Orr and also collaborated with chronobiologist Colin Pittendrigh. During the collaboration, Konopka worked to understand behaviors of Drosophila per mutants beyond their abnormal period lengths. Konopka was primarily interested in how these mutants behaved in constant light or constant darkness and whether they conformed to the rules established by chronobiologist Jurgen Aschoff. In addition, Konopka also observed behavior of the flies under varying light intensities and over a range of temperatures. Konopka found that the perS and perL flies showed reciprocal behaviors under the experimental conditions.[11] For example, perS period shortened, while perL period lengthened in response to decreasing temperature.[11] Konopka hypothesized that these reciprocal behaviors were a manifestation of two coupled oscillators, a model proposed in 1976 by Pittendrigh and Daan.[12]/nIn 1990, Konopka collaborated with Mitchell S. Dushay and Jeffery C. Hall to further investigate the effects of the clock gene in D. melanogaster. Konopka had noted in 1987 that the Clock (Clk) mutant, induced via chemical mutation, was a semidominant mutation that shortened the rhythm of locomotor activity in flies by around 1.5hr.[7] Dushay, Konopka and Hall noted that Clk mutants had phase response curve that was shortened from 24hr to 22.5hr, and that the short period was also observable in the eclosion rhythm of the mutant flies.[13] Clk was mapped close enough to the per01 mutation such that it could be considered a per allele, but due to the presence normal courtship song rhythms in Clk males and the lack of coverage of its effects via duplications, Dushay and Konopka determined that Clock was a novel circadian mutation.[13]/nBy working with Randall F. Smith and Dominic Orr of Caltech, Konopka discovered a new circadian mutant, named Andante, in 1990.[14] In contrast to Clock, Andante lengthens the period of eclosion, and locomotor activity by 1.5\u20132 hours, and was also shown to lengthen the periods of other circadian mutants.[14] Andante is a semi-dominant mutation, temperature compensated, and unaffected by the sine oculis mutation, which eliminates the outer visual system of flies. It was mapped to the 10E1-2 to 10F1 region of the D. melanogaster X chromosome, close to the miniature-dusky locus.[14]", "18247035": "Zden\u011bk Neubauer (30 May 1942 \u2013 5 July 2016) was a Czech philosopher and biologist, remarkable especially for original interpretations in science history and epistemology./nBorn in Brno to family of the Brno normative legal school representative Zden\u011bk Neubauer (sr.), Neubauer graduated from Charles University in Prague (1965 in microbiology, biology and chemistry, 1971 in philosophy).

He was formerly an assistant professor and then associate professor with tenure at the University of Pittsburgh between 1990 and 1997.[12] Since 1997 he has served as the director of research in the Department of Otolaryngology at the Drexel University College of Medicine (DUCoM).[13]/nEhrlich held an appointment as Technical Specialist at the State University of New York Research Foundation between 1984 and 1988.

Additionally, he directs the Meta-Omics Core Facility at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, which is a National Cancer Institute designated Cancer Center that encompasses Thomas Jefferson University and Drexel University.[15]/nEhrlich\u2019s research works span the fields of molecular diagnostics, genomics, molecular medicine, and evolutionary biology with particular emphases on chronic bacterial pathogenesis, comparative bacterial genomics, and human genetics.[16]/nEhrlich\u2019s research on the etiology of chronic middle-ear disease (otitis media) in the early 1990s in which he exploited the potential of the emergent field of molecular diagnostics led to his development of the biofilm paradigm of chronic infectious diseases.[17]/nEhrlich\u2019s biofilm work began with chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) and soon encompassed other chronic respiratory mucosal diseases including sinusitis; adenoiditis; pharyngitis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using the chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera) experimental model of COME his research supported the hypothesis that biofilm formation was a key driver in its pathogenesis.[18] Subsequently, he led a team that directly demonstrated the formation of bacterial biofilms on the middle-ear mucosa of children who had failed multiple rounds of antibiotic therapy, yet still suffered from either COME or recurrent OM.[19]/nEhrlich then developed a metabolic framework for understanding biofilm biology which he subsequently used for the development of a science for the treatment and management of infectious diseases.[20]/nWhile examining the role of biofilms in multiple otolaryngologic infections, Ehrlich concluded that understanding their physiology would be key to the formulation of effective treatment strategies[21][22] as biofilm bacteria are resistant to classical antimicrobial therapies. With this focus on developing methods for ameliorating chronic bacterial infections, he led a research team to identify novel bacterial treatment targets and to find small molecular inhibitors that could serve as anti-biofilm drugs. This work built upon his realization that biofilm resistance to antibiotics was not primarily due to issues of penetration, but rather, as he illustrated, due to metabolic quiescence attributable to oxygen limitation and a lack of fermentable substrates as he demonstrated using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model biofilm organism.[23][24] This anti-biofilm research program has resulted in multiple patent applications and employs a hybrid in silico and laboratory pipeline for the identification and characterization of small inhibitor molecules which can be used in combination with traditional antibiotics for the treatment of biofilm infection by targeting the bacterial stringent response.[25] In another research study, his team reported that with the controlled use of salicylic acid-releasing polymers, the biofilm formation can be hindered on plastic catheters.[26] In addition, he evaluated the issues associated with the biofilm infections in the orthopedic field for which he developed and promulgated the concept of \"intelligent implants\"[27] that would serve both their structural/dynamic functions while simultaneously self-monitoring and treating biofilm infections \u201cin situ\u201d as they occurred.[28]/nOne of Ehrlich's earliest works used the polymerase chain reaction and focused on the detection of human retroviruses including, HTLV-I and HIV.[29] In these studies, he used nucleic acid amplification combined with oligonucleotide-detection procedures to diagnose HIV in the infected strains.[10] More recently, his work during the COVID-19 pandemic included the establishment of a molecular diagnostics facility that provided both detection and sequence-based typing for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, he collaborated with a group or physicians to develop appropriate precautionary measures, and recommendations regarded as essential prior the resuming of the Elective Orthopaedic Surgery with a strict emphasis on preventing the spread of COVID-19.[30]/nMuch of Ehrlich\u2019s clinical and translational research has focused on the integration of technologies in bacterial genomics which have led to the identification of pathogens etiologically associated with various pathogenic disease processes. Through his early adoption and development of species-specific pan-domain molecular diagnostics including the Ibis Biosciences T5000 and his lab-developed, long-read 16S microbiome assay he has played a role in demonstrating that many inflammatory conditions are actually chronic polymicrobial infections in which the pathogens remain largely unculturable.  In particular, he has used these approaches in the study of orthopedic, neurosurgical, and wound infections to identify both known and novel pathogens in multiple conditions including: periprosthetic 'sterile' loosenings;[31] suspected infected arthroplasties; 'aseptic' arthritis; and ventroperitoneal shunts[32] as well as chronic non-healing wounds.[33]/nGiven the increasing prevalence of tick-borne diseases, Ehrlich along with a team of researchers expanded their research into the pathogenesis, fundamental biology, and detection strategies, and conducted a large-scale sequencing among the Borreliaceae for the formulation of a family-level pan-genome to be used for the development of species-specific and strain-specific diagnostics.[34]/nEhrlich\u2019s research works have led to the mapping and cloning of multiple human disease genes (alleles) as we well as the identification and characterization of virulence genes within pathogens through his introduction of statistical genetics and machine-learning methods to the characterization of unannotated bacterial genes. Most notably he led the research that identified the genetic bases for several craniofacial abnormalities[35][36] and hereditary pancreatitis;[37] in which multiple mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene were shown to be associated with the hereditary pancreatitis (HP).[38] Moreover, the research findings on hereditary pancreatitis also illustrated that the mutation in cationic trypsinogen gene is associated with the recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis, and argued that the chronic pancreatitis could be due to the recurrent pancreatitis.[39]/nEhrlich\u2019s distributed genome hypothesis which predicted the bacterial pangenome led to his application of statistical genetics for the identification of bacterial distributed genes that are associated with virulence and tissue tropism. This approach led to his identification and characterization of Msf1, an Haemophilus influenzae virulence factor that provides for the bacterium\u2019s survival and trafficking in human macrophages.[40] In addition, he has investigated the bacterial evolution underlying bacterial adaptation to the human lung environment.[41][42]/nEhrlich's recent research on the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is based on the argument that chronic biofilm infections contribute to the development of AD by continually triggering the brain's antimicrobial peptide response. This leads to an accumulation of the Abeta peptide and its polymeric form, beta-amyloid that is, at least in part, responsible for triggering the symptoms of dementia. According to his research, a complex polymicrobial dynamic contributes to the pathogenicity of Alzheimer.[43] Speaking with Katie Clark for the Drexel University Research Magazine, he commented, \"Despite the billions that have been spent, we have no effective drugs, we have done nothing to change the natural history of the disease... The approach people are taking is not right.\"[44]", "63401447": "Scott J.

These included Art Haas,[8] the first to see Ubiquitin chains, Keith Wilkinson,[2] the one to first identify APF-1 as Ubiquitin, and Cecile Pickart.[9]/nWhen Irwin Rose started on his prizewinning work on ubiquitin he was already very distinguished as an enzymologist./nOnly a selection of Rose's very extensive work in this field is mentioned here./nIn collaboration with Marianne Grunberg-Manago, Saul Korey and Severo Ochoa he investigated the Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate and ATP catalyzed by acetate kinase, an essential reaction for priming the tricarboxylate cycle,[10][11] describing the purification of the enzyme and measuring the equilibrium constant of the reaction./nWith Edward O'Connell, Rose investigated the mechanisms of the reaction catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase[12] and, with Sidney Rieder, of triose phosphate isomerase[13]/nWith Jessie Warms, he studied the mechanism of hexokinase of sarcoma tumor,[14] finding that it was located in the mitochondria of liver and brain, and bound in accord with a Mg2+-dependent equilibrium./nHe had a general interest in the role of magnesium in cells, and studied it on the basis of the equilibrium of the reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase,[15] a complicated question, because numerous complexes of Mg2+, H+ and K+ with ATP, ADP and AMP need to be taken into account./nStarting from Ogston's theory, Rose[16] was concerned with the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalysed reactions, investigating various enzymes,[17] and later glutamine synthetase.[18] This was the topic of a review article written with Kenneth Hanson.[19]/nAfter its discovery by Gideon Goldstein and colleagues in 1975,[20] ubiquitin was extensively studied by Rose, with Avram Hershko, Aaron Ciechanover, A.

He is widely regarded as one of the founders of paleobiology, and first described the theory of insular dwarfism. He was also a specialist on Albanian studies and completed the first geological map of northern Albania.[1][2]/nNopcsa was born in 1877 in D\u00e9va, Transylvania, Kingdom of Hungary (today Deva, Romania), to the Hungarian Nopcsa aristocratic family of Romanian origin. He was the son of Elek Nopcsa\u00a0[hu], a member of the Hungarian Parliament. In 1895 Nopcsa's younger sister Ilona discovered dinosaur bones at the family estate at Szacsal (today part of S\u00e2npetru, S\u00e2nt\u0103m\u0103ria-Orlea, Romania).[1][3] He shared the bones with Professor Eduard Suess, who encouraged him to study them.[4] Following the professor's advice, he started studying geology at the University of Vienna in 1897,[4] where he quickly advanced in his studies. He gave his first academic lecture in 1899 at the age of twenty-two.[5] He acquired a PhD in geology in 1903 from the university; his  doctorate focused on geologically mapping the area surrounding the family estate./nOn 20 November 1906 Nopcsa met the then eighteen-year-old Bajazid Elmaz Doda in Bucharest and hired him as his secretary.[6] Nopcsa later recounted this meeting in his memoir:[7][8]/n[H]e has been the only person who has truly loved me and in whom I had full confidence, never doubting for a moment that he would misuse my trust./nAdditionally, Nopcsa was interested in Albania, which was a province of the Ottoman Empire contending for independence in that time. He was one of the few outsiders who ventured into the mountainous areas in the north of Albania.[9] He soon learned the Albanian dialects and customs. Eventually, he got on good terms with the leaders of the Albanian nationalist resistance who fought against the Turks in the region. Nopcsa gave passionate speeches and smuggled in weapons./nIn 1907 on one of his expeditions into the Albanian mountains, he was held hostage by the bandit Mustafa Lita, together with Bajazid Doda. Lita demanded ten thousand Turkish pounds for his release.[6] In his memoirs Nopcsa described his elaborate plan to get out of this situation, which involved being taken to Prizren as a spy.[10] He was eventually rescued by Doda's father, who had brought 'ten armed retainers'.[11][10]/nIn 1912 the Balkan states joined forces to drive out the Turks. However, afterwards the newly liberated states immediately plunged into internal conflicts. During these Balkan Wars, Nopcsa spied for Austria-Hungary.[12] Out of these conflicts, Albania arose as an independent state, which needed a king. Nopcsa volunteered, suggesting he would use money he would gain from marrying a rich American girl to fund the war efforts, however, to no avail.[12][13]/nLater, during the First World War, Nopcsa was on another mission as a spy for Austria-Hungary, working undercover as a shepherd in Transylvania.[9][12] He also led a group of Albanian wartime volunteers. Also he  was the first to hijack\u00a0an aircraft in history. His motive for aircraft hijacking was to flee the nascent and ultimately short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919.[14]  With the defeat of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, Nopcsa's native Transylvania was ceded to Romania. As a consequence, the Baron of Fels\u0151-Szilv\u00e1s lost his estates and other possessions in 1920.[15] Compelled to find paid employment, he landed a job as the head of the Hungarian Geological Institute in 1925.[4][16]/nBut Nopcsa's tenure in the Geological Institute was short-lived, he soon became bored of the sedentary job. He went to Europe on a motorcycle journey together with his long-standing Albanian secretary and lover Bajazid Elmaz Doda to study fossils.[9][16][17] He later returned to Vienna where he ran into financial difficulties again and was distracted in his work. To cover his debts, he sold his fossil collection to the Natural History Museum in London.[18][19] Nopcsa struggled with illness, to the extent that he had to give a lecture in a wheelchair in 1928.[19] Soon Nopcsa became depressed. Finally, in 1933, he fatally shot first his partner, Bayazid Elmas Doda, after having slipped sleeping powder into his tea.[12][19] He then wrote a suicide note, where he states the reason for his actions a nervous breakdown, and shot himself.[1][9] He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering in Vienna, and his ashes buried there (Section 3, Ring 3, Group 8, No. 44). In his suicide note, he describes his reasons for killing his partner:[1]/nThe reason that I shot my longtime friend and secretary, Mr Bayazid Elmas Doda, in his sleep without his suspecting at all is that I did not wish to leave him behind sick, in misery and without a penny, because he would have suffered too much./nNopcsa left behind a considerable quantity of scientific publications and private diaries. The diaries paint a picture of a complex man with great intuition, but without the ability to understand the motives of others. His devotion to the cause of the Albanians was in contrast to his sociopathic insensitivity. In his diaries he nonchalantly wrote about his bid to become king of Albania:[20]/nOnce a reigning European monarch, I would have no difficulty coming up with the further funds needed by marrying a wealthy American heiress aspiring to royalty, a step which under other circumstances I would have been loath to take.'/nDuring his lifetime Nopcsa wrote a memoir based on diaries and notes from 1897 to 1917. Even though he finished the memoir around 1929, it was never published during his lifetime.[7] Only in 2001 was it published in German and it was later translated to English in 2014 as Traveler, Scholar, Political Adventurer: A Transylvanian Baron at the Birth of Albanian Independence, edited by Robert Elsie.[7][11]/nNopcsa's main contribution to paleontology \u2013 and hence \"paleobiology\" \u2013 was, that he was one of the first researchers who tried to \"put flesh onto bones.\" At a time when paleontologists were mainly interested in assembling bones, he tried to deduce the physiology and living behavior of the dinosaurs he was studying. Nopcsa was the first to suggest that these archosaurs cared for their young and exhibited complex social behavior, an idea that did not take off until the 1980s.[21] Because he was one of the first people to study the biology of dinosaurs, he is known as the 'father of paleobiology',[21] even though he himself coined the term \"paleophysiology\" for the study of the evolution of physiology and biology.[22] Some of his works in this field exploited paleohistological data.[23]/nAnother of Nopcsa's theories that was ahead of its time was that birds evolved from ground-dwelling dinosaurs, which is the theory of cursorial origin of flight.[24] He theorized that the Proavis, a theorized predecessor of birds, was running animal with forearms lifted off the ground, which they would flap as they made a jump. The scales on its forearms would develop into feathers to aid this, and eventually allowing for flight.[24] This theory found favor in the 1960s and later gained wide acceptance, though later fossil finds of tree-living feathered dinosaurs suggest the development of flight may have been more complex than Nopcsa envisioned. Additionally, Nopcsa's conclusion that at least some Mesozoic era reptiles were warm-blooded[17] is now shared by much of the scientific community./nNopcsa studied Transylvanian dinosaurs intensively, even though they were smaller than their \"cousins\" elsewhere in the world. For example, he unearthed six-meter-long sauropods, a group of dinosaurs which elsewhere commonly grew to 30 meters or more, which he named Magyarosaurus.[21] Nopcsa deduced that the area where the remains were found was an island, Ha\u021beg Island (now the Ha\u0163eg or Hatzeg basin in Romania) during the Mesozoic era.[25] He theorized that \"limited resources\" found on islands commonly have an effect of \"reducing the size of animals\" over the generations, producing a localized form of dwarfism. Nopcsa's theory of insular dwarfism\u2014also known as the island rule\u2014is today widely accepted.[26][27] Additional pygmy sauropods, named Europasaurus, were recently discovered in northern Germany.[28][29][30]/nNopcsa also created a theory about the dinosaurs' sexual dimorphism, which he published in 1926.[31] Among others, he thought that hadrosaurid species with the cranial crests were males and those without them were females. He paired Kritosaurus with Parasaurolophus, Prosaurolophus with Saurolophus and others. His examples were not proved to be true, but his opinion that sexual dimorphism was present among hadrosaurid dinosaurs has gained acceptance, see for example Lambeosaurus./nNopcsa discovered and named several species in his lifetime. In 1899 he named the species Mochlodon robustus,[32] which he later renamed to Rhabdodon robustum in 1915.[33] He also named Struthiosaurus transylvanicus, which he described in 1915.[6][34] In 1928 he named the Teinurosaurus (meaning \"extended tail lizard\").[35][36] He named the turtle species Kallokibotion bajazidi, which literally means 'beautiful box of Bajazid'. The reason for this name was that the shell reminded him of Bajazid's arse.[6]/nNopcsa was also interested in evolutionary theory,[37] especially on macroevolution, on which the fossil record can yield relevant data. [38]/nNopcsa was also an important geologist.[9] Indeed, Nopcsa was one of the first scholars to study the geology of the western Balkans, particularly northern Albania.[2]/nNopcsa became fascinated with Albania during his lifetime, probably through the tales of Albania's mountain tribesmen, to which he was first introduced by Louis Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, a man thought to be his first lover.[9] During his lifetime Nopcsa published more than fifty scientific studies concerning Albania, covering a wide range of linguistics, folklore, ethnology, history and kanun (that is, Albanian customary law).[39] He was one of the leading experts on Albania in his time.[39]/nAfter Nopcsa's death, several of his important manuscripts were left unpublished. He participated in the work of the Albanian Congress of Trieste, published his notes on the congress that became of particular historical interest.[1][40] He left the Albanological part of his estate along with a letter of manuscripts to be published to Norbert Jokl, a renowned specialist in Albanian studies and Nopcsa's former colleague.[7] At that time, Nopcsa's material consisted of thousands of pages of notes, sketches, and finished text. Subsequently, this library came into possession of Mid'hat Bey Frash\u00ebri. When Frash\u00ebri was forced to flee the country, Nopcsa's materials were confiscated by the communist regime of Enver Hoxha.[1] Eventually, Nopcsa's manuscripts, drawings, and completed writings formed the core of the Albanological section of Albania's National Library.[1][41]", "1043968": "Aaron Ciechanover (/\u0251\u02d0h\u0259\u02c8ro\u028an t\u0283i\u02c8h\u0251\u02d0no\u028av\u025b\u0259r/ \u24d8 AH-h\u0259-ROHN chee-HAH-noh-vair; Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05e6'\u05d7\u05e0\u05d5\u05d1\u05e8; born October 1, 1947) is an Israeli biologist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for characterizing the method that cells use to degrade and recycle proteins using ubiquitin./nCiechanover was born in Haifa, British Mandate of Palestine on 1 October 1947[1] into a Jewish family.[2] He is the son of Bluma (Lubashevsky), a teacher of English, and Yitzhak Ciechanover, an office worker.[citation needed] His mother and father supported the Zionist movement and immigrated to Israel from Poland in the 1920s./nHe earned a master's degree in science in 1971 and graduated from Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem in 1974.

Ullrich has received Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence, awarded by Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates in 2008 and Ullrich and his team received the Wolf Prize in 2010./nUllrich received his primary degree in biochemistry at the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg in molecular genetics in 1975. He did post-doctoral work at the University of California, San Francisco, from 1975 to 1977 and worked as a senior scientist at Genentech in San Francisco from 1978 to 1988. From 1988, he has been at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry.[1]/nUllrich was the first person to clone a human gene, insulin, into E coli.  He was one of the first employees of Genetech. While working for Genetech in 1979, he obtained a human insulinoma tissue sample from a surgeon in Munich.  The tumor had just been extracted from a woman.  Ullrich purified the insulin mRNA from this sample and cloned it into a vector that he inserted into E coli.  Thus, he produced a strain of E coli that would manufacture human insulin.[2]/nHe was one of several scientific leaders of 200+ scientists in developing the anti-cancer drug Trastuzumab (trade name: Herceptin) at Genentech, and has co-founded five biotech companies, Axxima, U3 Pharma, Kinaxo, SUGEN (acquired by Pfizer) and Blackfield./nHe is listed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) as a highly cited biologist and he is also in the top ten of H-index of living biologists.\nAmong many other achievements, he and his team have co-discovered two groups of receptor tyrosine kinases. In some tumours, (the cancerous state), some receptor tyrosine kinases tend to be over-active, due to genetic changes./nUllrich is also Principal Investigator of Singapore Oncogenome Project at the Institute of Medical Biology aimed at identifying all oncogenic alterations in all protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene transcripts of a large number of tumor cell lines and primary tumors. The laboratory also focuses on functional characterization and, in cooperation with clinical oncologists, investigation of the clinical relevance of the newly discovered PTK oncogenes which serves as basis for the development of novel multi-targeted drugs./nThe discovery of the drug Sunitinib and clarification of the multi-specific mechanism of action is partly based on discoveries of Axel Ullrich and his team at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in the 1980s in Munich. The discovery, medical and pharmaceutical development as well as clinical testing of the drug was carried out by about 100+ scientists and physicians, at SUGEN, a company co-founded in 1991 by Ullrich, and the Max Planck Society, and other investors./nSunitinib inhibits cellular signaling by targeting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These include all receptors for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), which play a role in both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. The simultaneous inhibition of these targets therefore leads to both reduced tumor vascularization and cancer cell death, and ultimately tumor shrinkage./nIn the early 1990s, Ullrich and his team identified the signaling system involved in regulating tumor angiogenesis, the growth of blood vessels in tumors. He and his team discovered that inhibiting a key player in the signaling system (called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or VEGFR) suppresses the generation of blood vessels in tumors and slows down cancer cell growth. Years later, a small molecule inhibitor of the VEGFR2 kinase function was developed, from which a derivative was approved in 2006 for the treatment of kidney carcinoma and gastro-intestinal stromal tumors.", "4353566": "James William Slessor Marr (9 December 1902 \u2013 30 April 1965) was a Scottish marine biologist and polar explorer.

The expedition failed to reach its final objective the Weddell Sea due to Shackleton's death on 5 January 1922. Upon his return Marr completed his MA in classics and BSc in zoology. In between he had to participate in fund raising events that were organised in order to cover the expedition's debts. Which included standing in scout uniform outside cinemas where the film Quest was being shown. Marr spent 1926 as a Carnegie Scholar at a marine laboratory in Aberdeen. He took part in the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) with Sir Douglas Mawson. He went on to become a marine biologist, taking part in the Discovery Investigations (1928\u20131929, 1931\u20131933 and 1935\u20131937) specializing in Antarctic krill.[2]/nIn 1943, during World War II, Lieutenant Marr was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on appointment as expedition leader of Operation Tabarin.

Also abundant in kidney tubules, the 28 kDa protein was related to proteins from diverse origins including fruit fly brain, mammalian lens, bacteria, and plants.[25] Since the function was unknown, Agre consulted John C. Parker, his former hematology professor at the University of North Carolina, who suggested that the protein may be the long-sought water channel responsible for rapid movements of water across the membranes of red cells and certain other cell types./nTeaming up with William Guggino at the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins, Agre's postdoctoral fellow Gregory Preston confirmed water channel function by expressing the cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes (frog eggs) that then became osmotically active and exploded in fresh water. The 28 kDa protein is now known as aquaporin-1 (abbreviated AQP1), the archetypal member of a large family of water channel proteins. Aquaporins are \"the plumbing system for cells,\" said Agre. Every cell is primarily water. \"But the water doesn't just sit in the cell, it moves through it in a very organized way. The process occurs rapidly in tissues that have these aquaporins or water channels.\" For 100 years, scientists assumed that water leaked through the cell membrane, and some water does. \"But the very rapid movement of water through some cells was not explained by this theory,\" said Agre.[26]/nAgre's team and others identified paralogs in different tissues, and twelve aquaporins exist in humans. Permeated by water, aquaporins are required for generation of cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humour, tears, sweat, saliva, humidification of airways, and renal concentration. Defects include cerebral edema, dry eye, anhydrosis, dehydration and water retention. Permeated by water plus glycerol, aquaglyceroporins confer glycerol uptake to the basal level of skin, glycerol release from fat during fasting, and glycerol uptake by liver where it is converted to glucose. Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins exist in all life forms including invertebrates, plants, microbes, archaea, and parasites including the plasmodia that cause malaria.[27]/nIn October 2003, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry would go to two medical doctors, Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon, \"for discoveries concerning channels in cell membranes.\" Credited for discovery of the aquaporin water channels, Agre was in bed at 5:30 am when the call came from Stockholm. Upon learning the news later, his mother responded, \"That's very nice but don't let it go to his head.\"[28] MacKinnon, credited with solving the structure and selectivity of potassium channels, was traveling back from a weekend fishing trip and only learned the news from colleagues./nLong interested in diseases of the developing world,[22] Agre and his team investigated aquaporins in malaria parasites, malaria mosquitoes, and cerebral malaria. In 2008, Agre became Director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute (JHMRI) at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Launched in 2001 by a gift from Michael Bloomberg and the Bloomberg Philanthropies,[29] JHMRI includes 20 faculty members[30] whose lab efforts include development of mosquitoes resistant to malaria transmission, design of novel malaria vaccines, biological studies of potential malaria drug targets and search for novel anti-malarial medicines.[31]/nFieldwork in rural Africa is central to the JHMRI mission. A long-term partnership was initiated in 2003 with Macha Research Trust, a faith-based research program led by Dr. Philip Thuma that is affiliated with a former mission hospital in rural southern Zambia. With resources from JHMRI, a small modern research campus was constructed where African scientists and visiting scientists from Johns Hopkins are studying malaria drug resistance, mosquito insecticide resistance, and rates of malaria transmission. Since introduction of artemisinin combination therapy in 2003 and distribution of insecticide treated bed nets in 2007, the burden of malaria in small children has declined in Macha by 96%.[32]/nReceipt of an International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research Award (ICEMR) from the US National Institutes of Health in 2010 allowed expansion of the JHMRI program in Africa.[33] New field sites were organized in partnership with African agencies in northern Zambia and southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where malaria control has failed, and in eastern Zimbabwe at the border of Mozambique, where malaria has become resurgent./nWhile serving from 2009 to 2011 as president and chair of the board of advisors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Agre became very active in the AAAS Center for Science Diplomacy. Working with AAAS Chief International Officer, Vaughan Turekian, and former Scientific Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, Norman P. Neureiter, Agre led a series of science diplomacy visits to countries with adversarial relationships to the U.S.[34] The objective of each trip was to foster exchanges and collaborations on peaceful scientific projects and thereby reduce tensions.[27][35]/nThe governments of Cuba and the US have maintained a hostile relationship made worse by the embargo that prevented the import of essential goods, equipment and even medicines. The inauguration of Barack Obama in 2009 led to a liberalized interpretation of restrictions by the U.S. government allowing scientific and cultural exchanges between the two countries./nIn November 2009, Agre made the first of six trips to Cuba when he led a group of scientists from AAAS to Havana. Two years later, Agre led an extensive series of visits to the Cuban Academy of Sciences and leading Cuban scientific institutions including the institutes for biotechnology, pharmaceutical and vaccine development, a teaching hospital and ELAM (Latin American School of Medicine) Cuba. Invited to lecture at the University of Havana, Agre also met with Fidel Castro who discussed numerous topics including the need for universal health care as one cause for the Cuban Revolution. Agre subsequently led another AAAS visit and served as Honorary President of Biotecnologia Habana 2012 and Plenary Lecturer at Quimcuba 2015.[36]/nDespite animosities, Cuba and the U.S. have had a long tradition of scientific interactions that dated from 1900. The outbreak of Yellow Fever at the time of the Spanish\u2013American War resulted in the Yellow Fever Commission led by US Army Major Walter Reed. Working together, Cuban medical scientist, Carlos Finlay, and a young Johns Hopkins faculty member, Jesse William Lazear, proved for the first time that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes. In a fateful experiment, Lazear allowed himself to be bitten by mosquitoes that had fed upon yellow fever patients, and he died of the disease. This discovery led to conquest of Yellow Fever. Cuba always felt that Finlay and Lazear never received proper credit, an issue partially ameliorated by the 2015 visit by the Johns Hopkins Health Advisory Board and plaque unveiling.[37]/nReferred to as the \"Hermit Kingdom,\" the DPRK has been nearly totally isolated from the world since the negotiated ceasefire in 1953. Requests for entry by US organizations were rebuffed. Working through the DPRK Ambassador to the UN, an invitation was issued to the Nobel Laureate-led AAAS team in partnership with CRDF Global for a visit hosted by the DPRK State Academy of Sciences in December 2009.[38] Avoiding issues related to weapons development, requests to visit 15 research institutes, universities, the Grand People's Study House, and a hospital were all granted. In most cases, the leadership of these institutions had never seen or met an American previously.[39] Potential future scientific collaboration in the life sciences such as medicine development and agricultural research received extensive and enthusiastic discussion. A follow-up visits by DPRK scientific leadership to the AAAS \u2013 CRDF team occurred 15 months later at the Carter Center in Atlanta./nA meeting occurred with the leadership of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a private university founded by a Korean-born American businessman. The only English language university in DPRK, PUST draws outstanding undergraduate and graduate students from DPRK and volunteer faculty from abroad.[40] Opening in 2010, PUST is the only campus where westerners can mingle with students in DPRK. Agre provided keynote plenary lectures to the first International Science Symposium at PUST in 2011 and the third symposium in 2015. Invited to participate in a tour of multiple DPRK universities by four Nobel Laureates in 2016, Agre was unable to attend due to a hospitalization. It would have been his fourth trip to the country.[41]/nA visit by Agre and the AAAS Science Diplomacy team to Myanmar occurred in April 2010. Travel was made to the new capital, Naypyidaw, for formal meetings with the Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Health to discuss malaria. A meeting with faculty of University of Yangon was also held. Despite continued existence of the junta, an impending transition was evident, as meetings with the opposition were arranged in Yangon.[42] Although Aung San Suu Kyi was unavailable as she was still under house arrest, her release occurred six months later, and Myanmar has made solid progress towards liberal democracy.[43]/nMeetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi at the New York residence of the Iranian Ambassador to the UN resulted in a June 2012 visit to Tehran by Agre and Norman P. Neureiter. Salehi, a PhD graduate of MIT and former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, arranged for lectures in multiple universities in Tehran where Agre was appointed visiting professor at the Sharif University of Technology and a private meeting was held with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.[44]/nAs Chairman of the Committee on Human Rights of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,[45] Agre led a group of prominent scientists that defended Thomas C. Butler, an infectious disease researcher from Texas Tech University who in January 2003 voluntarily reported to the university safety office that 30 vials of plague bacteria were missing and had probably been autoclaved or incinerated. Although Butler cooperated with FBI agents, he was accused of lying and was arrested. When he refused to plead guilty, federal prosecutors charged Butler with many confusing charges concerning grant accounting and sample shipping. Despite support from Agre and other scientists, Butler was convicted in a jury trial, lost his medical license, and served 2 years in prison.[46][47] Occurring at a time of large national fear following the 9/11 attacks, the incident has been seen by some as an overreaction by the FBI due to public fear of bioterrorism.[48]/nIn the spring of 2007, Agre announced that he would explore the US Senate race in his home state of Minnesota being contested by two residents originally from New York \u2013 incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman and challenger comedian Al Franken. Agre emphasized health care and environmental issues rather than the Iraq war. He said, \"The issues that were important to us at the millennium are still important today.\" He also felt that the US Senate would benefit from the perspective of a medical scientist.[49]/nDespite polls indicating that he could win, Agre announced in August 2007 that he would not enter the race for the Minnesota Senate seat, calculating the huge personal cost and the termination of his federally funded scientific research program and humanitarian service.[50][51] An advocate for increased representation of science in government, he would not rule out the possibility of seeking public office in the future.[52]/nAlthough Barack Obama carried Minnesota by a landslide, the senate election was a statistical tie resulting in a recount and six months of legal fights before the Minnesota Supreme Court awarded Al Franken the victory by only 312 votes out of 2.9 million ballots cast. The outcome was important as Franken was sworn in as Senator in July 2009 and provided the 60th vote necessary to end debate on the Affordable Care Act./nIn addition to being a founding member of Scientists and Engineers for Change, Agre was one of 48 Nobel laureates who signed a letter endorsing Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry for president./nAgre criticized many policies of the Bush administration. \"The Bush administration has been a disaster for the environment. They're playing Russian roulette by not signing the Kyoto Accord. If we wait until there's unequivocal proof that this is the cause of global climate change, it will be too late,\" he said.[53]/nHe has said that he admired Linus Pauling, another Nobel laureate and peace activist.[54]/nAgre served on the transition team for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, helping forge science policy and answers to scientific policy questions posed by Science Debate 2008.[55]/nIn 2015, Agre signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting.

At the age of 14, he was adopted by the Hata family, whose male members were doctors from generation to generation. Hata completed his medical education in Okayama at the Third Higher School of Medicine (now Okayama University School of Medicine). In 1897, he became an assistant at Okayama Prefectural Hospital where he learned internal medicine from Zenjiro Inoue and biochemistry from Torasaburo Araki./nSahachiro Hata researched bubonic plague with Japanese bacteriologist and physician, Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d, who co-discovered the infectious agent, a bacterium called Yersinia pestis.[2] Hata worked as an assistant for Kitasato and conducted research into the prevention of plague and other epidemic diseases. Hata helped formulate the \"Communicable Disease Prevention Law,\" which was enacted in 1897 as the first legal framework for disease control in Japan. Among other things the law mandated reporting of certain disease to a public health agency in service of their control.[3]/nIn 1909, Sahachiro Hata went to work in Paul Ehrlich's laboratory, the National Institute for Experimental Therapeutics, in Frankfurt, Germany to help Ehrlich in his quest to develop a treatment for syphilis called the 'magic bullet.'[4] The causative agent of syphilis was discovered to be the spirochete Treponema pallidum by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann in 1905.[4] Syphilis was initially treated by topical-application or ingestion of mercury, which was very toxic.[4] However, arsenical compounds had proven to be effective against trypanosomes, which are similar to spirochetes, so Ehrlich directed Hata to screen all of the known synthetic arsenic derivatives for antisyphilitic properties.[5]/nWhen Hata injected compound 606, arsphenamine, into rabbits infected with syphilis, he found it to be effective against syphilis in vivo.[2][6] It was called compound 606 because it was the 606th compound that Ehrlich and Hata tested. Arsphenamine was first thought to be ineffective when it was tested by Ehrlich's former assistants, so their inadequate methods were blamed for the delay of this important discovery.[4]/nAt the Congress for Internal Medicine at Wiesbaden in April 1910, Ehrlich and Hata shared their successful clinical results, which showed that arsphenamine treated syphilis in humans.[7] The drug was marketed under the name Salvarsan and gained international acclaim as the \"arsenic that saves\" and as the first man-made antibiotic.[7] In the wake of their discovery, some sections of European society condemned Hata's and Ehrlich's 'magic bullet' because they believed that syphilis was a divine punishment for sin and immoral acts, and thus the infected did not deserve to be cured.[7]/nBefore Salvarsan, drugs were not made to target specific diseases, like in the case of mercury treatments.[5] Therefore, Hata's and Ehrlich's work represents a turning point for experimental and therapeutic pharmacology and paved the way for the development of antibiotics decades later.[4] Salvarsan was established as the standard treatment for syphilis until it was replaced by the antibiotic penicillin after World War II, which has fewer adverse side effects.[2]/nHata returned to Japan and became the leading bacteriologist of his generation and continued his work testing arsphenamine against syphilis.[7] Hata became a director at the Kitasato Institute, and he also lectured at Keio University.

At this time, only 500 (less than 10%) female students were allowed to study at the university, in contrast to more than 5,000 men. Furthermore, despite doing the same work as male students, female students received only \u201ctitular\" degrees, rather than full Cambridge degrees that would make them members of the university.[14]\nDuring her studies at Cambridge, she became interested in embryology. She went on to do her PhD with Ronald Fisher, who was Professor of Genetics in Cambridge, where she characterised a mutant mice strain with a 'pallid' mutation and published the research. During the course of her PhD she moved to the University of Edinburgh, where she completed her studies under the direction of Douglas Falconer.[16]/nAfter her PhD (awarded 1950[17]), Lyon joined the group of Conrad Hal Waddington, with whom she worked in the last part of her PhD. The group was funded by the Medical Research Council, and she worked with TC Carter to investigate mutagenesis and the genetic risks of radiation.[16] In addition to the 'pallid' mutation mice, she studied mutations such as 'ataxia' (a nervous mutation which caused walking difficulties in the mice) and 'twirler' (a mutation which induced inner ear issues, causing the mice to shake their heads and walk in circles due to lack of balance)./nIn 1955, her group moved to the MRC radiobiology unit in Harwell, where there was room for more mouse facilities. There she continued to investigate the mouse mutations. She also scrutinised a 'mottled' mutant, which had a different effect on male and female mice: male embryos sometimes died, and the surviving males had white coats, but females lived and were variegated. Through calculated and deliberated breeding of mutants, she investigated the transition of the mutation and concluded that the mutation was positioned on the X chromosome. This, together with new findings at that time concerning the X chromosome, led her to hypothesize about X chromosome silencing.[14]/nLyon published many papers on radiation and chemical mutagenesis and on studies of mutant genes.[18] She also did extensive work on the mouse t-complex.[19][20]/nShe was head of the Genetics Section of the MRC Radiology Unit at Harwell from 1962 to 1987. Although she retired from research in 1990, according to an interview from 2010, she was still active in the laboratory a few times a week.[14]/nIt was while working on radiation hazards in 1961 that she discovered X-chromosome inactivation, for which she is best known,[15] and the phenomenon is sometimes known as Lyonization in her honour. Her subsequent research helped elucidate the genetic control mechanisms of the X chromosome and helped explain why female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders can display mild symptoms.[21]/nLyon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1973,[4] a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The son of botanical aficionado Eduardo Wenceslao Holmberg\u00a0[es] and grandson of the Baron Holmberg, Holmburg accompanied Argentine Libertador Manuel Belgrano on his campaigns and introduced the cultivation of the camellia to Argentina. As director of the Buenos Aires Zoological Garden he greatly developed its scientific aspect, publishing booklets and providing printed media for a learned appreciation of its contents. He also directed the Natural History Cabinet of the University of Buenos Aires and published the standard reference works on botany and zoology used in his country for most of the 20th century./nWhile less distinguished for his writing, he was arguably the first science fiction writer in Latin America. He wrote the first Latin American science fiction novel, Viaje maravilloso del se\u00f1or Nic-Nac al planeta Marte (Eng. The Marvellous Journey of Mr. Nic-Nac to the Planet Mars). In 1879, he wrote Horacio Kalibang o los aut\u00f3matas (Eng. Horacio Kalibang or The Automatons), the first short science fiction story of Latin America./nComing from a European Bourgeois family, Holmberg had mastered English, French, and German by the time he became Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires. He had grown up in close contact with his father's gardens and extensive literature collection, gaining a life-long interest in botany and entomology. He quickly learned Latin as well, an essential for scientific studies at the time./nHe became a doctor in 1880 with a thesis on phosphene, however he never practiced the profession. Despite the low standing of natural history at the time, Holmberg had studied the science for nearly a decade at the time of his graduation, beginning with the documentation of native flora and fauna in his study Travels in Patagonia, 1872 (Es. Viajes por la Patagonia, 1872). From 1874 onward he dedicated himself to the study of arachnids, publishing several studies over the next decade and laying a foundation for the study of the arthropods in the country. That very same year he married the young Magdalena Jorge, a fashionable lady of Buenos Aires society. He was published in the Annals of Argentine Agriculture (Es. Anales de la Agricultura Argentina) and the Zoological Periodical (Es. Peri\u00f3dico Zool\u00f3gico), two of the most important scientific publications of the era, describing species and investigation the effects of agricultural activities on the natural world./nIn 1877 he completed his journey through Patagonia with an expedition to the north, during which he crossed the Chaco providence, the Altiplano in the Andes and Cuyo providence. The botanical and zoological descriptions he collected on this trip were reviewed and published in the Board of Education Bulletin (Bolet\u00edn del Consejo de Educaci\u00f3n), and then led studies published through the National Academy of Sciences of Argentina, the Annals of the Argentine Scientific Society and the Argentine Geographic Society magazine, as well as the book Mammals and Birds of Salta./nIn 1878, along with the entomologist Enrique Lynch Arrib\u00e1lzaga, Holmberg founded the first magazine dedicated exclusively to biology in Argentina, The Argentine Naturalist. Only one issue was published, but the quality of the material caused numerous scientific institutions around the world, including the British Museum, to request copies. The magazine would then be translated through an important collaboration with the American Journal of Natural History, founded in 1891 by Florentino Ameghino./nHolmberg abandoned the study of spiders relatively early, but he enthusiastically approached the exploration of the diversity of Argentine biology. From 1881 onwards he would systematically explore all the biomes of the country, collecting the results of his research in the monumental Scientific Results, especially those zoological and botanical of the three journeys carried out in 1881, 1882, and 1883 to the Tandil Mountain Range (Es. Resultados cient\u00edficos, especialmente zool\u00f3gicos y bot\u00e1nicos de los tres viajes llevados a cabo en 1881, 1882 y 1883 a la sierra de Tandil). The exploration of Chaco also included Ameghino, leading to the ignition of a long and fruitful collaboration between the two. Holmberg made several new scientific expeditions to the Tandil mountain range (1883), to Chaco (1885), to Misiones, (1897), and to Mendoza./nIn 1888 he was appointed director of the Buenos Aires Zoo, which he boosted greatly, in terms of both collection and infrastructure. Founded during the administration of President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, the Zoo did not even have a definitive plan. Holmberg appointed a commission to this effect, composed of Florentino Ameghino, Carlos Berg and Lynch Arrib\u00e1lzaga, to which the current layout is due almost in its entirety. He would occupy the position of director until 1904, when he distanced himself from the organization after a disagreement with the municipal authorities./nThe grounds of the Zoo were a swampy shoal, divided by the tracks of the Northern Railroad and partly occupied by a shooting club. Holmberg had complete freedom for the redesign, which entailed the redirection and removal of the railway, the filling of the swamp, the layout of the paths and the construction of the pavilions; His idea was to design them according to the architecture of each region of origin, creating fantastic buildings of great architectural value. The largest of these pavilions had not yet been completed when he stopped working at the zoo. This was the Hindu temple destined to house the elephants, replica of a Hindu temple in Bombay designed by Vicente Cestari./nWith the idea of forming a diverse source of zoological training, Holmberg acquired European, African and Asian species to complement the rich fauna of the interior of the country. He also implemented changes in the treatment and feeding of wild animals, improved their visibility to the public, and encouraged the role of scientific dissemination of the zoological garden before the purely recreational./nIn 1909, botanist Crist\u00f3bal Mari\u00e1 Hicken (1875-1933),named a genus of flowering plants from southern South America, (belonging to the family Amaranthaceae) in his honour Holmbergia[1][2]", "8515216": "Clifford Allan Redin Savory (born 15 September 1935) is a Zimbabwean livestock farmer and president and co-founder of the Savory Institute.

There is no other known tool available to humans with which to address desertification that is contributing not only to climate change but also to much of the poverty, emigration, violence, etc. in the seriously affected regions of the world.\"[2] \"Only livestock can save us.\"[3] He believes grasslands hold the potential to sequester enough atmospheric carbon dioxide to reverse climate change.

His recommendations were not enacted during his time in the Game Department, but later in 1969 as a Member of Parliament he brought about a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry led by George Petrides charged \u201cto investigate and report on all aspects of wild life policy and management in Rhodesia and to make recommendations thereon.\" Following the recommendations of the Petrides Commission, Dr. Graham Child was appointed Director of National Parks and Wild Life Management who then implemented an elephant culling program. In a 2004 article discussing the program, Dr. Child noted that \u201cwhile I was Director 30,529 [elephants] were killed, mostly on culls, and the countrywide population grew from an estimated 44,109 to 52,583 animals.\u201d[21]/nHowever, this culling program did not reverse the degradation of the land as expected, and Savory has called his decision to advocate for the culling of large numbers of elephants \"the saddest and greatest blunder of my life.\"[22][23] This preventable loss of life, the result of interpreting research data to fit the prevailing world-view that too many animals causes overgrazing and overbrowsing, led to Savory becoming even more determined to understand and resolve the root cause of land degradation and to prevent others from making the same short-sighted mistakes which he attributed to applying reductionist thinking to complex living systems. This eventually led to Savory's development of a holistic framework for decision-making and to the creation of Holistic Planned Grazing, as detailed in his books, Holistic Management, Third Edition: A Commonsense Revolution to Restore Our Environment, written with his wife Jody Butterfield, and Holistic Management Handbook, Third Edition: Regenerating Your Land and Growing Your Profits, written with Sam Bingham and Jody Butterfield./nSavory was influenced by earlier work of French agronomist Andr\u00e9 Voisin who said that overgrazing resulted from the amount of time plants were exposed to animals, not from too many animals in any given area.[24] Savory saw this as a solution to overgrazing, and believed that overgrazing was caused by leaving cattle too long and returning them too soon, rather than the size of the herd.[25][26]/nSavory says in his memoir that he enlisted as a ranger with the British Colonial Service in the Northern Rhodesian Game Department to prepare himself for guerilla warfare - learning techniques like bush skills and tracking of animals like elephants from local traditions, which could then have military applications in counter-insurgency.[27] In the early 1960s, when Savory was a Territorial (reserve) Army officer, he wrote to Federal Prime Minister Roy Welensky recommending the military prepare for impending guerrilla warfare by training trackers - a recommendation which was rejected by conservative senior officers.[28] However, in the early 1960s, his ideas began to gain acceptance when the Federal Army's elite all-white Special Air Service (SAS) invited him to present courses on tracking and \"aggressive bush craft\" - which were deployed against African nationalist insurgent groups fighting against the colonial government.[28]/nAt the time of Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, Savory was a Captain in the part-time Territorial Army unit, the 4th Battalion Royal Rhodesia Regiment. He opposed UDI quietly. In 1965, Savory presented a paper to Rhodesian Army Headquarters suggesting the formation of a Guerrilla Anti-terrorist Unit (GATU) with white SAS operators and black police who would specialize in tracking, and pose as African nationalist insurgents to infiltrate and eliminate their groups - this request was approved, but disagreement between army and police led to the unit's termination.[28] Before GATU was disbanded, Savory recalls that on operations \"we whites were blackened with special dye produced for us\".[27] Subsequently, the army allowed Savory to select members of the entirely white Territorial Army, who were also rangers from the Rhodesian Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management (DNPWLM), and civilian professional hunters to form the Tracker Combat Unit (TCU) - as the unit had no black personnel, plans to infiltrate groups were abandoned, and re-focused on tracking and killing African nationalist insurgents.[28] After Savory\u2019s departure from the TCU, it later evolved to become the Selous Scouts.[29][30]/nSavory was elected to the Rhodesian Parliament representing Matobo constituency in the 1970 election. After resigning from the Rhodesian Front in protest over its policies and handling of the war, in 1973 Savory reformed the defunct Rhodesia Party formerly led by Sir Roy Welensky. Savory stated in March 1973 that the primary aim of the Rhodesia Party under his presidency was \"to ensure the long-term future of the European in Rhodesia through strong and just government\" and as part of this white economic superiority must be maintained, but the extreme differences between white and black wages should be lessened so that \"good government\" would reduce calls for \"self-government\".[31] The party also stated that it did not want African members, and in March 1973 stated that it \"will not be a party to a coalition with African members of Parliament\".[31] In May 1973, Savory stated that the Rhodesia Party supported racial segregation including of schools and hospitals, recommending that only Africans who have to work in towns such as domestic servants should be housed in urban areas - and suggested the introduction of a \"Minister for Population Control\" who would handle the \"population explosion\" among Africans.[31] In June 1973, Savory publicly stated, \"If I had been born a black Rhodesian, instead of a white Rhodesian, I would be your greatest terrorist.\"[32] Although he urged white Rhodesians to understand why he would feel this, the reaction to this statement led to Savory's ousting from the Rhodesia Party. In 1977, other moderate white parties united in opposition to Ian Smith in what was known as the National Unifying Force (NUF) led by Savory.[33] The NUF party won no seats in the 1977 election, and Savory relinquished leadership to Tim Gibbs, son of Rhodesia's last governor. Savory continued to fight Ian Smith and his policies, in particular opposing the Internal Settlement under Bishop Abel Muzorewa.[34] In 1979, due to conflicts with the Smith government, Savory left Rhodesia and went into self-imposed exile to continue his scientific work.[32]/nAfter leaving Zimbabwe, Savory worked from the Cayman Islands into the Americas, introducing holistic planned grazing as a process of management to reverse desertification of 'brittle' grasslands by carefully planning movements of dense herds of livestock to mimic those found in nature, allowing sufficient time for the plants to fully recover before re-grazing. Savory immigrated to the US, and with his wife Jody Butterfield founded the Center for Holistic Management in 1984. Its name was later changed to the Savory Center and later Holistic Management International. In 2009 Savory left HMI and formed the Savory Institute. Savory, Butterfield and philanthropist Sam Brown formed the Africa Centre for Holistic Management, based in Zimbabwe in 1992 on 2,520 hectares (6,200 acres) of land Savory donated for the benefit of the people of Africa as a learning/training site for holistic management.[35]/nWhen not travelling the world spreading his message, Savory and Butterfield split their time between their house in Albuquerque and a thatched-roof complex of mud huts in the African bush in Zimbabwe. He frequently goes barefoot.[36]/nHis 2013 TED Talk, \"How to green the desert and reverse climate change,\"[22] attracted millions of views and was followed up by the release of his TED Book, The Grazing Revolution: A Radical Plan to Save the Earth.[37] In his TED Talk Savory asks, \"What are we going to do?\"/n\"There is only one option, I'll repeat to you, only one option left to climatologists and scientists, and that is to do the unthinkable, and to use livestock, bunched and moving, as a proxy for former herds and predators, and mimic nature. There is no other alternative left to mankind.\"[38]/nSavory advocates using high technology to develop alternative energy sources and to reduce or eliminate future emissions. He supports grass fed beef and vehemently opposes industrial livestock production.[39][40]/n\"The number one public enemy is the cow. But the number one tool that can save mankind is the cow. We need every cow we can get back out on the range. It is almost criminal to have them in feedlots which are inhumane, antisocial, and environmentally and economically unsound.\"[41]/nSavory condemns the practice of slash-and-burn cultivation of forests and grasslands,[40] saying that it \"leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon, and worse than that, burning one hectare of grassland gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants than 6,000 cars. And we are burning in Africa, every single year, more than one billion hectares of grasslands, and almost nobody is talking about it.\"[38] One billion hectares is an area greater than that of the Sahara desert./nFarmers, ranchers, pastoralists and various organizations are working globally to restore grasslands through the teaching and practice of holistic management and holistic decision making.[42] This includes conservation projects in the US, Africa, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Canada, and Australia in which various NGOs, government agencies and universities are practicing holistic management and its holistic planned grazing  to reverse desertification using livestock as the main agent of change to restore the environment, increase ground cover, soil organic matter and water retention, replenish streams, and combat biodiversity loss.[39][43]/nIn 2003 Australia honored Savory with the Banksia International Award \"for the person doing the most for the environment on a global scale\"[9] and in 2010, Savory and the Africa Centre for Holistic Management won The Buckminster Fuller Challenge,[10] an annual international design competition awarding $100,000 \"to support the development and implementation of a strategy that has significant potential to solve humanity's most pressing problems\".[44]/nSavory has faced criticism for his political and military involvement in colonial Rhodesia in the 1970s - particularly for supporting racial segregation and proposing a \"Minister for Population Control\" to handle the \"population explosion\" among Africans during his presidency of the Rhodesia Party,[31][45] and for developing and teaching tracker techniques for all-white military units which were used to track and kill African nationalist insurgents fighting against the colonial government.[28][46]/nSavory has faced criticisms for claiming the carbon sequestration potential of holistic grazing is immune from empirical scientific study.[47] For instance, in 2000, Savory said that \"the scientific method never discovers anything\" and \u201cthe scientific method protects us from cranks like me\".[48] A 2017 factsheet authored by Savory stated that \u201cEvery study of holistic planned grazing that has been done has provided results that are rejected by range scientists because there was no replication!\".[49] TABLE Debates sums this up by saying \"Savory argues that standardisation, replication, and therefore experimental testing of HPG [Holistic Planned Grazing] as a whole (rather than just the grazing system associated with it) is not possible, and that therefore, it is incapable of study by experimental science\", but \"he does not explain how HPG can make causal knowledge claims with regards to combating desertification and climate mitigation, without recourse to science demonstrating such connections.\"[47]/nSavory's approach to the problem of desertification has met resistance from scientists. A meta-analysis of relevant studies between 1972 and 2016 found that Holistic Planned Grazing had no better effect than continuous grazing on plant cover and biomass, although it may have benefited some areas with higher precipitation.[50] Conversely, three 2007 and 2010 studies document soil improvement as measured by soil carbon, soil biota, water retention, nutrient-holding capacity, and ground litter on grazed land using multi-pasture grazing methods compared to continuously grazed land.[51][52] There is also evidence that multi-pasture grazing methods may increase water retention compared to non-grazed land.[53] However, George Wuerthner, writing in The Wildlife News in a 2013 article titled, \"Allan Savory: Myth And Reality\" stated, \"The few scientific experiments that Savory supporters cite as vindication of his methods (out of hundreds that refute his assertions), often fail to actually test his theories. Several of the studies cited on HM web site had utilization levels (degree of vegetation removed) well below the level that Savory actually recommends.\"[54]/nThere is a less developed evidence base comparing Savory's methods with the absence of livestock on grasslands. Several peer-reviewed studies have found that excluding livestock completely from semi-arid grasslands can lead to significant recovery of vegetation and soil carbon sequestration.[55][56][57][58][59] A 2021 peer-reviewed paper found that sparsely grazed and natural grasslands account for 80% of the total cumulative carbon sink of the world\u2019s grasslands, whereas managed grasslands have been a net greenhouse gas source over the past decade.[60] A 2011 study found that multi-paddock grazing of the type endorsed by Savory resulted in more soil carbon sequestration than heavy continuous grazing, but very slightly less soil carbon sequestration than \"graze exclosure\" (excluding grazing livestock from land).[61] Another peer-reviewed paper found that if current pastureland was restored to its former state as wild grasslands, shrublands, and sparse savannas without livestock this could store an estimated 15.2 - 59.9 Gt additional carbon.[62]/nIn his TED talk, Savory claimed that holistic grazing could reduce carbon dioxide levels to pre-industrial levels in a span of 40 years. According to Skeptical Science, \"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [...] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising.[...] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk of desertification and methane emissions from livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate change.[63]\". Commenting on his TED talk \"\u2018How to fight desertification and reverse climate change\u2019, Savory has since denied claiming that holistic grazing can reverse climate change, saying that \u201cI have only used the words address climate change\u2026 although I have written and talked about reversing man-made desertification\u201d.[47]/nAccording to a 2016 study published by the University of Uppsala, the actual rate at which improved grazing management could contribute to carbon sequestration is seven times lower than the claims made by Savory. The study concludes that holistic management cannot reverse climate change.[64] A study by the Food and Climate Research Network in 2017 concluded that Savory's claims about carbon sequestration were \"unrealistic\" and very different from those issued by peer-reviewed studies.[65] The FCRN study estimates that, on the basis of meta-study of the scientific literature, the total global soil carbon sequestration potential from grazing management ranges from 0.3-0.8 Gt CO2eq per year, which is equivalent to 4-11% of total global livestock emissions, and that \u201cExpansion or intensification in the grazing sector as an approach to sequestering more carbon would lead to substantial increases in methane, nitrous oxide and land use change-induced CO2 emissions\u201d[65] Project Drawdown estimates the total carbon sequestration potential of improved managed grazing at 13.72 - 20.92 Gigatons CO2eq between 2020\u20132050, equal to 0.46-0.70 Gt CO2eq per year.[66] A 2022 peer-reviewed paper estimated the carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management at a similar level of 0.15-0.70 Gt CO2eq per year.[67]/nIn a 2012 address to the International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress, Prince Charles said:/n\"I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called Allan Savory, in Zimbabwe and other semiarid areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that it is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast feedlots, the land dies.\"[68]/nThe Savory Institute was one of eleven finalists in the Virgin Earth Challenge,[69] a 2007-2019 competition which offered a $25 million prize for whoever could demonstrate a commercially viable design that resulted in the permanent removal of greenhouse gases out of the Earth's atmosphere to contribute materially in global-warming avoidance.[70] None of the entries satisfied all the necessary prize criteria.[71]", "14478994": "James Adolf Israel (2 February 1848 \u2013 2 February 1926) was a German surgeon./nIsrael was a native of Berlin, where he was born to Jewish parents.

Working with Paul Hansma in the Physics Department, she applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to study biomolecules. She was the Principal Investigator of NSF grants from 1991 to 1994,[9] 1994\u20131997, 1997\u20132000 and 2000\u20132003.[10] She has conducted research on imaging and manipulating molecules on mica surfaces using AFM.[11] Since 2007, her major area of research is the origin of life. She hypothesizes that life originated between mica sheets and that the mechanical energy of mica sheets, moving apart and together, might have provided energy before chemical energy was available.[12]/nHansma has worked on the applying AFM of DNA to illustrate its structure,[13] its surface biology,[14] its motion,[15] and its condensation.[16][17] She described advances in AFM of DNA[18] and the benefits of using an aqueous solution for the imaging of DNA with AFM.[19] She then investigated the adsorption of DNA to various substrates using AFM and showed that the presence of a divalent cation greatly improves DNA adsorption, which requires electrostatic adsorption to the surface.[20] In related research, she used AFM to image small fragments of DNA that have been labeled with a chimeric protein fusion between streptavidin and two immunoglobulin G-binding domains of staphylococcal protein A.[21] While analyzing the efficacy of different modes of AFM she highlighted that the resolution is best in propanol while tapping AFM in dry helium provides a convenient way of imaging conformations of DNA molecules and positions of proteins on DNA. In an aqueous buffer, DNA molecules as small as 300 bp have been imaged even when in motion.[22] She found that the binding of DNA to mica is correlated with the radius of the transition metal cation.[23]/nHansma also examined the potential applications of atomic force microscopy (AFM) of DNA to the human genome project and stated that the AFM is capable of imaging DNA reproducibly but is not capable of sequencing DNA without further improvements.[24] Additionally, she has worked on the AFM of lipids and showed its usefulness in imaging biological processes.[25] She has also studied lipid membranes and showed that AFM was capable of visualizing the defects in the lipid bilayers.[26]/nNear the turn of the millennium, Hansma's research included the AFM of spider silks[27] and bacterial biofilms. She evaluated the use of atomic force microscopy and single-molecule force spectroscopy to study the structure of spider dragline silk[28] and demonstrated its modular sacrificial bonds that contribute to its strength and toughness.[29] Using an artificial silk protein provided by researchers from the U.S. Army Natick R&D Center, she then presented models for molecular and supramolecular structures of the protein, derived from amino acid sequences, force spectroscopy, and stretching of bulk capture web.[30] Furthermore, with Patricia Holden and members of her lab, she analyzed the surface properties and physical morphology of Pseudomonas putida biofilms[31] and investigated how biofilm bacteria adapt to low nutrient availability in unsaturated environments.[32]/nHansma is also known for her work on mica sheets and the origin of life.[33] In her paper, \"Possible origin of life between mica sheets: does life imitate mica?\" she explored various elements that support her hypothesis regarding the origin of life between mica sheets. She noted that these sheets provide stable compartments, mechanical energy for bond formation, and isolation needed for Darwinian evolution. Moving mica sheets have the ability to facilitate mechanochemistry, resulting in the synthesis of prebiotic organic molecules.[34][35] She highlighted key resemblances between life and the hypothetical origin between mica sheets.[36] In 2014, she suggested that the likelihood of life's emergence increases with an increase in molecular crowding, and the confined spaces between Muscovite mica sheets provide advantages for the origins of life.[37]/nLater, in 2017, Hansma proposed that membraneless organelles, or biomolecular condensates, may have existed prior to the emergence of membrane-bound structures during the origins of life. These biomolecular condensates typically contain RNA and protein and could have formed and sheltered in the interstitial spaces between mica sheets, which offer favorable conditions for the origin and development of life.[38] During her research on the origin of life, she discussed the prevalence of mechanical forces and mechanical energy in living cells and suggested that these may have preceded chemical energy at life's origins.[39][40]", "67333810": "Jemma Louise Geoghegan (born 1985 or 1986)[1] is a Scottish-born evolutionary virologist, based at the University of Otago, New Zealand, who specialises in researching emerging infectious diseases and the use of metagenomics to trace the evolution of viruses.

She was offered the opportunity to do the PhD by Professor Hamish Spencer, who said he \"chose Geoghegan for the post because of her 'interesting' background.\"[2] On completion of her PhD in evolutionary biology in 2012,[3] Geoghegan went to New York where she worked with a group at New York University that was focused on HIV. In 2013 she moved to Australia and worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Sydney from 2013 to 2017, before getting her own laboratory at Macquarie University.[1]/nGeoghegan worked as a lecturer at Macquarie University from 2017 to 2020.[4] In 2017 for her research as an evolutionary biologist, she received the Tall Young Poppy Award.[5]/nSince 2020 Geoghegan has been a senior lecturer in the University of Otago's microbiology and immunology department and an associate senior scientist at the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR). In August 2023 she was promoted to the Webster Family Chair in Viral Pathogenesis at Otago.[6]/nGeoghegan has been described as one of New Zealand's \"standout communicators... one of the faces of this country's COVID-19 genome sequencing efforts.\"[1] Writing in The Spinoff, the New Zealand-based scientist Siouxsie Wiles acknowledged Geoghegan as \"one of the people behind New Zealand's incredible efforts to sequence all the strains of the virus we get here.\"[7] Wiles also recommended that those interested in learning more about genome sequencing should check out research being developed by a team that included Geoghegan.[8] The paper for this research was later published on 11 December 2020.[9]\nThe Guardian acknowledged Geoghegan as \"one of the scientists leading work to analyse genomic sequences of the virus.\"[10]/nWhen Britain decided in July 2021 to lift all public health restrictions following lockdowns during COVID-19 despite only half of the population being vaccinated, Geoghegan shared the concerns of Siouxsie Wiles, Ashley Bloomfield and Julie Anne Genter that this was likely to lead to more dangerous virus variants circulating worldwide, undermining vaccination programmes. She said this was \"[training] the virus to escape vaccine-induced immunity\", and the country needed a higher threshold of vaccination to deal with the Delta variant.[11]/nIn January 2022 as the Omicron variant began circulating New Zealand and it appeared that there would be a further mutation, BA.2,[12] Geoghegan noted that \"the new mutation is largely found through genome sequencing as only certain types of PCR (nasal swab) tests pick up the subtle differences between Delta and BA.2...[but that]...people who are fully vaccinated with boosters were \"effectively protected\" against the new variant.[13]  By June 2022 it was widely held that Omicron would likely become endemic in New Zealand. Considering the implications of this, one commentator wrote, \"the only determinants of how many people will be sickened, disabled or killed by the virus are its evolutionary leaps and our actions to shape its environment.\"[14] Geoghegan agreed that the host and the virus are in an \"evolutionary arms race where they keep changing to try and beat each other\", but noted it is difficult to predict how the virus could change as new variants attempt to evade immunity from vaccination or prior infection. She said factors such as \"rapidly replicating and infecting cells inside a chronic, immunocompromised person...[or]...a recombination of different variants, perhaps in an animal host\" could affect this.[14]/nEarly 2020 when questions were being asked about the causes of the coronavirus pandemic, Geoghegan was asked on 7 News, as a scientist whose \"expertise focuses on the area where animals and humans meet\", if and how COVID-19 had jumped from animals to humans. She explained that bats do contain viruses similar to COVID-19, but to confirm they were \"genetically related\", it was necessary to look at the \"genetic signatures\" in the virus.[15] In 2018 Geoghegan had participated in a research study that used a metagenomics lens to show by examination of the genome sequencing of viruses in fish as the ancestors of all vertebrates, how a virus can spread and evolve through time and space, confirming it exists in nature and not necessarily made by humans.[16] She has noted that the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is closely related to other viruses that are present in nature and that as a new SARS virus, the coronavirus was likely to have taken a similar route to that which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003 when it was spread from live animals to humans. Geoghegan concluded, \"human interactions with live animals make a host jump more likely to occur, and live animal markets are a massive source of these interactions.\"[17]/nGeoghegan published an article in the Australasian Science Journal (2016) that researched the role of biological factors such as the size, structure and mode of transmission of viruses in predicting their risk of being transmissible amongst humans.[18] In the same year she collaborated on research with Edward Holmes that explores whether viruses could be predicted.[19] When discussing the research with Ed Yong at The Atlantic, Geoghegan said prediction is difficult because of the vast number of viruses and supported the conclusions of another scientist, Kristian Anderson, from Scripps Research Institute when he said it was \"simply impossible...[to predict]...whether a newly discovered animal virus could jump into humans and cause a pandemic.\"[20] In the article, Geoghagen argued that it is best to identify \"fault lines\" where animals and people interact. Yong concluded: \"The kind of surveillance that Geoghagen,  Andersen, and others are calling for...[is]...vital.\"[20]  \nIn May 2020, Geoghegan told  The Sydney Morning Herald, that the best way to gain knowledge of possible prediction of viruses is to fund surveillance of people, particularly in places where they interact with live animals and identify the \"risk zones\"[21] Introduced by Kate Hawkesby on Newstalk ZB as \"an expert in genome sequencing\", Geoghegan explained that when a virus jumps from person to person, it creates a new mutation that could be tracked in terms of origin and possible spread in the community.[22]/nIn August 2023, Geoghegan co-authored an article warning new strains of avian influenza (known as bird flu) were causing a worldwide panzootic amongst aquatic birds, with [increasingly common] \"spillovers to non-avian hosts such as mammals\".[23] The article noted that as of 2023 there had been no cases of the variants in New Zealand, but cautioned the country was vulnerable because of the high number of migratory birds that come each year, some of which may experience asymptomatic infections. The authors noted that New Zealand had little surveillance of active viruses in wildlife and suggested a series of steps the country could take to be prepared for incursions. These would include raising awareness when there are unexpected deaths of animals, increasing targeting of known pathogens and  maximising the use of the \"viral genomics capabilities...established during COVID-19.\"[23]/nIn May 2020 as a result of a collaboration between Otago University and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), Geoghegan was allocated $600,000 from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) COVID-19 Innovation Acceleration Fund.  Her role was to lead an international team of scientists to sequence the genomes of all of New Zealand's positive COVID-19 cases and track how the virus spread across New Zealand.[24] By August 2020, the team was able to show genomic sequencing confirming that the origin of the virus in New Zealand was from overseas, and was mostly spread within the country at social gatherings.[25] When Auckland had another community outbreak of the virus in August 2020,  Geoghegan told Kathryn Ryan on RNZ National that the work she was involved in with the ESR could identify which quarantine facility or border outpost the virus had originated from and compare the genomes of the new cases to the ones from the \"managed-isolation facilities\", or from around the world.[26]/nIn a podcast Geoghegan explained how genome sequencing worked and that internationally the data gathered was being shared as a rapid response to COVID-19.[27] Following the second outbreak of the virus in the New Zealand community in August 2020, Geoghegan said:/nIt is vital that genomics is part of this response to enable us to track where these cases may have arisen and to estimate the size and number of clusters present...[and]...by comparing the virus genomes from these cases to those from both the quarantine facilities and the global population, we can determine their likely origin and how long they have been circulating in the community.[28]/nIn November 2020, when an aircrew member who had arrived in New Zealand from overseas tested positive, Geoghegan reiterated the importance of genome sequencing to establish whether the virus related to local or global infections and the likelihood that transmission of the cases occurred during the flight.[29]/nOn 22 October 2020, the Royal Society Te Aparangi announced that Geoghegan was awarded the government-funded Rutherford Discovery Fellowship.  The $800,000 scholarship would fund Geoghegan's study, which was entitled Ecological barriers and drivers of virus emergence. Its aim was to show \"how viruses evolve to make the jump to a new host species, by sequencing RNA from diverse animal species in New Zealand and analysing any viruses present\". Geoghegan described this as significant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and would be the \"first study examining virus ecology and evolution of such magnitude in this country.[30][31]/nIn 2021, Geoghegan's work continued and was focused initially on the UK virus variant that had broken out in New Zealand. She said that the variant did contain a \"few mutations that were likely increasing the rate of transmission...[but]...the biggest driver of virus spread is a population that doesn't have any immunity, which is basically all of New Zealand.\"[32]/nIn 2017 Geoghegan gained The Young Tall Poppy Award run by the Australian Institute of Policy and Science (AIPS). Geoghegan said that she was very passionate about communicating research findings to the wider community and the award was an opportunity for her to become more skilled in this area.[33]/nGeoghegan received the Genetics Society of Australia Alan Wilton Award to recognise outstanding contributions to the field of genetics research by Australasian scientists early in their career in 2017.[34]/nIn 2017 she won the Macquarie University Faculty of Science and Engineering Excellence in Early Career Research Prize.[35]/nIn May 2022 Geoghegan was awarded the 2021 Prime Minister's Emerging Scientist prize, worth $200,000.[36] In North & South magazine, Paul Gorman wrote that \"hundreds, if not thousands, of New Zealanders are still alive thanks to Geoghegan and colleagues tracking outbreaks of the Delta variant during the elimination phase of the pandemic. Some contemporaries believe she has helped save millions of lives around the world due to people avoiding the virus.\"[2] Geohegan acknowledged that by receiving the award she was challenging the stigma around women in science, and \"planned to use the funds from the award to support further research and student training.\"[37]", "56094388": "Saumitra Das (born 20 January 1962) is an Indian microbiologist and a professor at the Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology of the Indian Institute of Science.

She was initially unable to find an academic job in botany, so she worked as a lab technician. She then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Mayo Clinic. She again followed her husband to San Diego, and she found employment at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where she first began working with dinoflagellates, and began her investigations in circadian rhythms. In 1961 she moved to Yale, where she was appointed a lecturer in algal physiology. However, at Yale she was never given a permanent position, so in 1967, she returned to the west coast, with an appointment at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she was made professor in 1971, and professor emerita in 1982.

However, she encountered delays in procuring the equipment, so on the suggestion of her colleague Marston Sargent, she attempted to culture dinoflagellates. An early success was the discovery that Akashiwo sanguinea (then known as Gymnodinium splendens) requires vitamin B12 in order to grow.[5][13][2][6]/nShe was also able to culture Lingulodinium polyedra (then known as Gonyaulax polyedra), and became interested in its bioluminescence.

At that time, biological rhythms were known for a variety of assemblages of cells but Sweeney noted that when such rhythms shifted, it was impossible to tell if all cells shifted or if the population became unsynchronized.  To address this question, she studied single cells in Cartesian divers and found that rhythms occurred in single cells that responded similarly to resetting stimuli.[14]  John Woodland Hastings (known as Woody Hastings) heard Sweeney present her work on rhythms at a conference in Asilomar in 1955 and became acquainted with her because he shared her interest in bioluminescent dinoflagellates.[15] They began a collaboration, with Woodland joining her at the Scripps Institution during the summers of 1955 to 1957.[2] Together with Woodland's student Marlene Karakashian, they characterized the circadian rhythm of the species.

He left school early due to sight loss as a result of typhoid fever, and taught for a short period in Saint Mary's College after partially recovering his sight.[5]/nIn 1922, aged 21, Amoroso went to Dublin, Ireland, and enrolled at University College Dublin (UCD) to study medicine, initially supporting himself by selling newspapers outside the main railway station.[4] At UCD, he received an array of student awards and scholarships, with prizes in botany, zoology, chemistry and physics (1923), anatomy and physiology (1925), pathology, pharmacology, materia medica and therapeutics (1927), and medicine, obstetrics, and the John McArdle Medal in surgery (1929).[5] While still studying he gave lectures in anatomy, in which subject he earned a BSc with honours in 1926.[3] In 1929 he graduated MB BCh BAO with first-class honours, achieving the highest marks ever attained in the final medical exam (while also doing some amateur boxing),[4] after which he completed his surgical internship at the now defunct Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin.[6][1]/nIn December 1929, Amoroso received a scholarship from the National University of Ireland to complete research work on myelination of pigs' cranial nerves. Funded by this \"travelling studentship\", he went to Germany for a year to study in Albert-Ludwigs University and Kaiser Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Zellforschung (Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Cell Physiology) until 1932. During this time, he learned German, and published his first paper in that language. His fluency in German (an accomplished linguist, he spoke six languages)[7] was helpful with his later work on the placenta, as much of the early research on that topic was done by German aristocrats.[5]/nIn 1933, Amoroso went to London, where he was demonstrator in embryology and histology at University College London. Also in 1933, he began a PhD, which he received in 1934 for his work on the development of the urogenital system in rabbits. After a chance meeting with Hewlett Johnson, later to be known as the \"red dean of Canterbury\", Amoroso was told about an opening with the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) for a senior assistant for histology and embryology, and he successfully applied for the position, his appointment taking effect in October 1934.[5] In his early days at the veterinary college, as the first staff member of colour, he was subjected to racism and resentment from some colleagues.[5][8] He became a lecturer in Histology and Embryology at the RVC in 1935.[3]/nFor the duration of World War II, the Royal Veterinary College was moved to the campus of the University of Reading. During this period, Amoroso collaborated with several other reproductive biologists. He was a founder member, in 1946, of the Society for Endocrinology; he would go on to become its treasurer in 1956 and eventually chairman from 1961 to 1966.[5] In 1947, he became a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and the next year he was appointed as professor of physiology at the Royal Veterinary College. In 1957, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, the first person from the West Indies to be a Royal Society fellow.[6] Amoroso became professor emeritus at the Royal Veterinary College after retiring in 1968.[5]/nThereafter, he moved from London to Cambridge, living in Cherry Hinton, and in 1969 was appointed visiting scientist at the Agricultural Research Council's Institute of Animal Physiology at Babraham in Cambridgeshire.[5] Additionally, during the 1970s, he often lectured internationally, holding visiting professorships in Australia, Canada, Chile, the US, and Nairobi, Kenya, and in 1973 was appointed Special Professor to the Department of Physiology and Environmental Studies at the University of Nottingham.[9]/nIn 1931, Amoroso published his first paper, on the epithelium of the pancreas.[10] As Lord Zuckerman noted: \"Then came others on diverse topics. Twenty years passed before he began to focus on the problem of placentation, with which his name will be best remembered. Here his gift of synthesis found full play. He threw new light on the evolutionary adaptation of the placenta for viviparous reproduction, his conclusions being based not just on his own researches and experience as a microanatomist and general biologist, but on his familiarity with the literature in several disciplines.\"[2] Amoroso's research into the placenta was published in Francis Marshall's Physiology of Reproduction in 1952. He published his last paper at the age of 80, having amassed more than 144 publications.[7]/nAmoroso received countless professional honours. As well as being elected FRS in 1957, he was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1960, Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1965, of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1966, and of the Royal College of Pathologists in 1973.[1] The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons made him an honorary associate in 1959 and in 1964 he was awarded the MD of the National University of Ireland.[4]/nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1969 Birthday Honours, for services to Veterinary Physiology.[11] In 1971, the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad, named him Professor Emeritus with the degree of Doctor of Science honoris causa in recognition of his research and contributions to the development of the field of medicine.[7] He was awarded many other honorary doctorates, including from the National University of Ireland (1963), the University of Chile (1966), the University of Illinois (1967), the University of Nottingham (1970), and the University of Guelph, Ontario (1976).[8] In 1977, the government of Trinidad and Tobago awarded him the nation's highest honour, the Trinity Cross.[7]/nIn addition, he was awarded the Mary Marshall medal of the Society of Fertility, the Carl Hartman medal of the Society for the Study of Reproduction, and in honour of his 80th birthday was presented with the Dale Medal by the Society for Endocrinology at a symposium on 29 September 1981.[4]/nAmoroso had a failed marriage in 1936, but did not divorce because of his Catholic views.[1] Known universally as \"Amo\", he was described as having \"a great sense of occasion and always added a touch of class to everything he did. The bow tie, the small red rose in the buttonhole, the fine cigar, the charming letter of thanks\u2014 they were all part of his personal mystique.\"[5] Highlighting his style, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes: \"He possessed the ability to distil complex arguments and to identify key facts from which he presented a lucid and elegant summary. His mastery of the English language was complete and generations of students were captivated by the literary flair of this man who was slightly larger than life with a touch of flamboyance\u2014cigar, pocket handkerchief, and bow-tie\u2014who referred to himself as an Afro-Saxon.\"[4] An eloquent public speaker,[3] he had a sense of humour that was \"exemplified by an account of an invitation to dinner with a rich widow in New York, with Professors Wislocki and Dempsey, two anatomists who hoped to obtain funds for their research. The lady was carving a turkey when she asked Amo which type of meat he liked. His reply 'breast please' shocked her and she gently advised him that one should refer to white meat or dark meat. On the eve of his return to England, he sent the lady a beautiful orchid, expressing the hope that she would pin it to her white meat in honour of the occasion.\"[1]/nAmoroso died on 30 October 1982, aged 81,[6] at the home of friends in Leeds.[4] For a year before his death, he had been ill with heart disease.[12] A memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Babraham, on 6 January 1983, for his close friends and colleagues, and a memorial mass in London at the Church of St Anselm and St Cecilia in Kingsway, on 28 February,[4] with an address being given by Lord Zuckerman, representing the Duke of Edinburgh, Patron of the Royal Veterinary College.[1]/nThe Amoroso Award was instituted in his memory and is presented for outstanding contributions to small animal studies by a non-clinical member of university staff.[13]\nThe Amoroso Lecture was established in 1984, by the former Society for the Study of Fertility, as a memorial lecture in honour of Professor Amoroso, and was held annually until 2004.[14] The Emmanuel Ciprian Amoroso Award for Medical Sciences is an honour presented by Trinidad's National Institute for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST).[15][16]/nProfessor Amoroso's papers are held at the Wellcome Library.[8]", "52195015": "Suvendra Nath Bhattacharyya (born 4 October 1975) is an Indian molecular biologist, epigeneticist and the principal scientist at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.[1][2] He is a recipient of the Swarnajayanthi Fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Bioscience Award of the Department of Biotechnology.[3] The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2016, for his contributions to biological sciences.[4]/nSuvendra Nath Bhattacharyya, born on 4 October 1975 in the Indian state of West Bengal, did his early schooling at Harinavi DVAS High School.[5] He completed his M.Sc. from Ballygunge Campus of Calcutta University.

Andrews is the founder and president of the biotechnology company Sierra Sciences.[1] In the 1990s, he led the team at Geron Corporation that was the first to successfully identify the genes for human enzyme telomerase.[2][3][4][5] This enzyme is responsible for preventing telomeres from shortening in human primordial germ cells (reproductive cells).[6]/nAndrews was born on December 10, 1951, to television producer Ralph Andrews and Margaret Andrews. As a child, Andrews was told by his father that he should grow up to become a doctor and find a cure for aging.[1] Andrews graduated from Cate School in 1971. He graduated from the University of California, San Diego in 1976 with two BSc degrees in Biology and Psychology, and earned his Ph.D. in Molecular and Population Genetics at the University of Georgia in 1981.[7][8]/nAndrews has been a medical researcher in biotech since 1981.[9] He first worked at the biotechnology company Armos Corporation then Codon Corporation. Codonwas purchased by Schering AG and became Berlex Biosciences. In 1993, Andrews convinced Berlex to send him to an anti-aging conference at Lake Tahoe, California, where he met Calvin Harley of Geron Corporation.[1] Harley gave a speech on the subject of telomeres and telomerase, their discovery in the organism Tetrahymena by Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and on the possible connection between telomeres and aging. Harley mentioned that no one had yet been successful in discovering the genes for telomerase in human beings. After the speech, Andrews approached Harley and told him that he could discover the genes for human telomerase for Geron in three months. Harley hired Andrews as Geron's Director of Molecular Biology. Three months and a half months later, Andrews' team cloned the RNA component of telomerase (\"hTR\").[1] For this discovery, and the demonstration that the anti-sense of hTR could kill every cancer cell tested, Andrews and 3 members of his team were awarded second place for \"National Inventor of the Year\" in 1997 by the Intellectual Property Owners Association (first place having been awarded for the invention of the HIV Protease Inhibitor).[10] Andrews' team later co-discovered the protein component of human telomerase (\"hTERT\") as well.[1][5]/nIn 1998, Andrews founded Yonder Technologies, that later became Sierra Sciences in 1999 in Reno, Nevada, with the specific goal of curing human aging. Andrews assembled a team to search for a small molecule(s) that would bind to the telomerase repressor(s), causing the body to constitutively express telomerase in the presence of that molecule(s).[2] From 1999 to 2005, Sierra Sciences' focus was to identify the telomerase repressor protein, in the hopes that a drug could be specifically designed to bind to it. During this time frame, Geron Corporation discovered TA-65, a small-molecule telomerase activator derived from Astragalus membranaceus. Sierra Sciences tested its efficacy,[11] and shortly thereafter, Andrews became the first paying customer to take the supplement.[2]/nIn 2005, Andrews switched to the \"brute force\" strategy of developing assays to screen large numbers of random chemicals to determine whether they induced expression of telomerase.[1] In November 2007, after nearly two years of screening, Sierra Sciences discovered the chemical C0056784,[2] which induces approximately 5% as much telomerase as is found in the immortal cancer cell line HeLa.[12] In 2008, using C0057684 as a positive control, Sierra Sciences developed a more sensitive real-time PCR based high-throughput screening assay, the \"hTERT RT-PCR assay,\" with which they were able to screen 4,000 chemicals per week.[12] In 2010, Andrews and Sierra Sciences entered into an agreement with John Anderson, founder of Isagenix International, to use the new assay to screen natural ingredients for telomerase activity. A year later, based on the assay's results, Isagenix launched Product B, a telomase inducing nutraceutical.[13]/nAndrews' team developed an hTERT Gene Therapy, using the Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) as a vector, for research studies.[14] This gene therapy was later licensed to Libella Gene Therapeutics in 2017 to be used in clinical studies.[15]/nAndrews is a named inventor on over 50 US-issued patents on telomerase and author of numerous scientific research studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.[16]/nAndrews is an ultramarathon runner.[2] In 2008[17] and 2009,[18]", "12480209": "Pardis Christine Sabeti (Persian: \u067e\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u0633 \u062b\u0627\u0628\u062a\u06cc; born December 25, 1975) is an Iranian American computational biologist, medical geneticist, and evolutionary geneticist.[2] She developed a bioinformatic statistical method which identifies sections of the genome that have been subject to natural selection and an algorithm which explains the effects of genetics on the evolution of disease.[3][4][5][6][7]/nIn 2014, Sabeti was part of a team led by Christian Happi, a Cameroonian geneticist, which used advanced genomic sequencing technology to identify a single point of infection from an animal reservoir to a human in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.[8] RNA changes suggests that the first human infection was followed by exclusive human to human transmissions.[9] The work led her to be named one of Time Magazine's Persons of the Year in 2014 (Ebola Fighters), and one of the Time 100 most influential people in 2015.[10][11]/nSabeti is a full professor in the Center for Systems Biology and Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University and on the faculty of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H.

At seventeen he began studying medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, finishing his training at the University of Edinburgh before graduating MD from the University of St Andrews (where he had never studied).[1][3]/nFrom 1813 Leach concentrated on his zoological interests and was employed as an 'Assistant Librarian' (what would later be called Assistant Keeper[1]) in the Natural History Department of the British Museum, where he had responsibility for the zoological collections.[1] Here he threw himself into the task of reorganising and modernising these collections, many of which had been neglected since Hans Sloane left them to the nation. In 1815, he published the first bibliography of entomology in Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclopedia (see Timeline of entomology \u2013 1800\u20131850).  He also worked and published on other invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds.[4] and was the naturalist who separated the centipedes and millipedes from the insects, giving them their own group, the Myriapoda.

He was one of the most laborious[a] and successful, as well as one of the most universal, cultivators of zoology which this country has ever produced.\"[5]/nDespite his expertise in particular animal groups, Leach's greatest contribution was his almost single-handed modernisation of the whole of British zoology following its stagnation during the long war with post-revolutionary and Napoleonic France./nIn Britain zoologists remained committed to the system of animal classification introduced by Linnaeus in the middle of the 18th century.  This was a powerful tool but its principles led to artificial groupings of species when creating larger groups such as genera and families.  For example, Linnaeus had called all animals encased in a hard outer skeleton, insects.  He therefore grouped butterflies with lobsters, scorpions, spiders and centipedes but these animals are not otherwise similar in appearance, do not live in the same environment, and do not behave in the same way.  The grouping does separate animals with hard outer skeletons from jellyfish, worms, snails, vertebrates, etc. but does not produce a group 'Insecta' with clear similarities shared by all its members./nIn continental Europe in the late 18th century naturalists began to revise the way they grouped species.  They used a wider array of characters, not just one or two, and began to discern groups of species that physically resembled one another, lived in similar ways and occupied similar habitats.  They created new genera to house these coherent groups and referred to these as 'natural genera'.  They named this approach the 'natural method' or 'natural system' of classification./nUnlike many of his countrymen, Leach was aware of these developments across the English Channel. He read the French literature and, despite the war with France, corresponded with the zoologists in Paris.  He applied the new principles to his own research and brought them to the attention of other British zoologists through his publications.  Between the years 1813 and 1830 he produced more than 130 scientific articles and books.[b]  By applying the natural method in these works he created more than 380 new genera, many of which have stood the test of time and remain valid today./nIn 1834, at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Leonard Jenyns reported on The Recent Progress and Present State of Zoology.  Discussing the science in the years before 1817 he noted the advances made on the Continent, then continued, 'England, we fear, has but little to produce as the result of her labours in zoology during the same period. Our countrymen were too much riveted to the principles of the Linnaean school to appreciate the value of the natural system ... There was a general repugnance to everything that appeared like an innovation on the system of Linnaeus; and for many years ... zoology, which was making rapid strides in France and other parts of the Continent, remained in this country nearly stationary. It is mainly to Dr Leach that we are indebted for having opened the eyes of English zoologists to the importance of those principles which had long guided the French naturalists. Whilst he greatly contributed to the advancement of the natural system by his own researches, he gave a turn to those of others, and made the first step towards weaning his countrymen from the school they had so long adhered to.'[6]/nTwo years later, the year of Leach's death, the House of Commons completed a detailed investigation of the management of the British Museum.  During their interviews the MPs had received confirmation from John Edward Gray that it was Leach who, \"was the first to make the English acquainted, by his works and by his improved manner of arranging the collections of the Museum, with the progress that had been made in natural science on the Continent. Thus a new impetus was given to zoology\".  Edward Griffiths (translator of George Cuvier's Le R\u00e8gne Animal) told the inquiry that in Britain, before Leach's work, \"zoology was utterly neglected; 20 years ago it was anything but popular; certainly there were very few amateurs that paid much attention to it.\"  \"In your judgment,\" the committee proposed, \"Dr Leach has the eminent credit of having raised the science of zoology in England?\" \"Indeed I think so\" replied Griffiths.[7]/nIn his short career Leach had brought British zoology back to the cutting edge of the subject and as a consequence had put the next generation of British zoologists on much firmer ground.  The next generation of British zoologists contained both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.[c]/nDespite his impact, today Elford Leach is remembered mainly in the scientific names of the many species that honour him.  In the years up to 1850 alone 137 new species were named leachii, leachiana, leachella, elfordii, elfordiana and other variants.[9]/nLeach is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards, Anolis leachii and Rhacodactylus leachianus.[10]/nIn the non-scientific literature he is honoured in the common names of several species.  Leach's storm-petrel was named after him by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820[d] and the blue-winged kookaburra, Dacelo leachii, is also known as Leach's kookaburra.[4] Leach created the genus Dacelo for the kookaburras in 1815./nLeach's nomenclature was often personal \u2013 he named nineteen species and one genus after his employee and friend John Cranch, who had died while collecting the species in Africa on the expedition of HMS Congo. He named nine genera after an unknown woman called Caroline, using anagrams of that name and the Latinised form Carolina, for example: Cirolana, Conilera and Rocinela.[2][11] These include the marine isopod crustacean Cirolana cranchi which he named in 1818 after both Caroline and Cranch.[11][12][e]/nLeach's written works during his time at the British Museum include the following:[1]", "55471831": "Maya Schuldiner is an Israeli biologist working at the Weizmann Institute of Science.[1]/nHer research focuses on organelles, using high-throughput screening and imaging techniques to discover the functions of proteins in yeast.

Following Genentech, he has been a Founder or Principal in several biotech companies. These include Canji, Inc., NewBiotics, Receptor Biologix, and Halozyme./nFollowing Ullrich's characterization of the HER2 protooncogene, Shepard collaborated with Ullrich and Slamon to explore possible links to breast cancer. Slamon discovered, along with other colleagues in the field, that HER2 overexpression in breast cancer predicts shorter survival. However, a lot of proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells and correlate with shorter survival. Therefore, the remaining question was: Is the overexpression of HER2 a significant driver in tumor progression and how does this work? Shepard and Hudziak discovered that too much HER2 made tumor cells grow better. Then made a key discovery about how HER2 can cause resistance to immune cell killing of tumor cells. Overexpression of HER2 makes cells resistant to killing by macrophages, which are the first line of defense against cancer. This work was done in collaboration with Dr. Hans Schreiber at the University of Chicago. Shepard and colleagues at Genentech (Paul Carter, Gail Lewis) then invented Herceptin, the first monoclonal antibody that blocks a cancer-causing protein, and developed it into a life-saving therapy for women with breast cancer. The innovation reduces the risk of recurrence and extends survival time for patients with metastatic as well as early-stage disease. Every year, more than 50,000 women in the US are diagnosed with the type of breast cancer that the drug attacks, and over 2.3 million individuals have received the treatment since it became available./nShepard has made seminal contributions to gene therapy of cancer, to tumor suppressor gene targeted small molecule therapeutics, and to drugs which target the tumor extracellular matrix.

He would then earn his Ph.D. at MIT in 1927./nAfter earning his Ph.D. in 1927 from MIT, Proctor went to work as an instructor in the biology and public health department at the institute. Proctor would be appointed to assistant professor of food technology in 1930, associate professor in 1937, professor in 1944, and department chair in 1952. Proctor would serve as chair until his sudden death in his office on September 24, 1959./nDuring his career at MIT, Proctor worked on the application of food irradiation with Samuel A. Goldblith and Daniel F. Farkas, both of whom were graduate students under Proctor at MIT. Goldblith would later work with Proctor on the MIT faculty until Proctor's 1959 death. Proctor and his boss at MIT, Samuel Cate Prescott, would also publish the first book on food science in 1937 entitled Food Technology, published by McGraw-Hill. Proctor also served as director of Subsistence Research of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps in Washington, DC during World War II./nAs food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the slaughterhouse for meat and poultry processing, the cannery for canned foods, and bakeries for bread as examples, the need to have personnel trained for the food industries. Literature such as Upton Sinclair's The Jungle in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) later that year. The United States Department of Agriculture was also interested in food technology and research was also being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and the University of California, Berkeley. By 1935, both Prescott and Proctor decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this. A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President Compton in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 to July 2, 1937, with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with \"fifty or sixty people.\" 500 people actually attended the event./nThis meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by George J. Hucker of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station (part of Cornell University) in Geneva, New York, a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938, on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939, to further discuss this. The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939, with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session Fred C. Blanck of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the Institute of Food Technologists. This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as president, Roy C. Newton of Swift & Company in Chicago, Illinois as vice president, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer. By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members. Proctor was one of the charter members of IFT, serving as president in 1952\u20133.

He also argued that her claim that around 1.7% of births are intersex is incorrect, because most of the conditions she considered intersex are not considered intersex from a clinical perspective.[17] Philosopher of science David N. Stamos argued that Fausto-Sterling's theory of a sexual continuum is problematic because sex, for Stamos, is defined by gamete type.[18][19] The psychologist Suzanne Kessler, in her book Lessons from the Intersexed, criticized Fausto-Sterling's analysis in \"The Five Sexes\" because it \"still gives genitals...primary signifying status and ignores the fact that in the everyday world gender attributions are made without access to genital inspection.\" Kessler further commented that \"What has primacy in everyday life is the gender that is performed, regardless of the flesh's configuration under the clothes.\"[20] In a later paper titled \"The Five Sexes, Revisited\", Fausto-Sterling wrote that she now agreed with Kessler's objections to the five-sex theory.[4]", "43806503": "Hans Ris (June 15, 1914 \u2013 November 19, 2004) was an American cytologist and pioneer electron microscopist.

He spent most of his career at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Pearl was a prolific writer of academic books, papers and articles, as well as a committed populariser and communicator of science. At his death, 841 publications were listed against his name. An early eugenicist, he eventually became an important critic of eugenics. He also advanced the concept of carrying capacity, although he didn't use the term, and was a Malthusian concerned with resource limits. He was a critique of mass consumption. [1]/nPearl was born into an upper-middle-class family on June 3, 1879, in Farmington, New Hampshire, the son of Ida May (McDuffee) and Frank Pearl.[2][3] At an early age, Pearl was exposed to the classics.  His parents and grandparents wanted him to study Greek and Latin.  However, when he attended Dartmouth College at 16 years old, he became fascinated by biology and graduated with a B.A. as the youngest in his class.  At Dartmouth, he was known to be an exceptional student as well as a skilled musician.  He was capable of playing almost every wind instrument, and he planned amateur music performances with his friends and colleagues.  In 1899, Pearl attended the University of Michigan where he received his PhD in zoology for his work on the behavior of planarians.  He also was involved in studying the variation of fish for the Biological Survey of the Great Lakes.  While working in a zoological laboratory, he met his future wife, Maude M. De Witt.  In 1903, they married, and together in 1905 and 1906, they traveled abroad and worked at the University of London, University of Leipzig, and Marine Biological Station in Naples.[4]/nIn 1906, he spent a year studying under Karl Pearson at University College, London. During this year he discovered biometry, which seemed to offer a solution to the problems he was concerned with in biology, zoology and eugenics. On his return to the US he continued his interests, but was converted from biometry to Mendelian genetics./nPearl's interest in statistical methods in biology began at the University of London, where he worked alongside Karl Pearson.  He stayed as an instructor at the University of Michigan until 1906, and that same year, he went to the University of Pennsylvania to be an instructor in zoology.  A year later, he became the head of the Department of Biology of the Main Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Maine in Orono where he studied the genetics of poultry and other domestic animals.  From 1917 to 1919, Pearl was the Chief of the Statistical Division of the United States Food Administration.  In 1918, Pearl developed a department of laboratory statistics when he was recruited by Johns Hopkins University to be the Professor of Biometry and Vital Statistics.[4]/nIn 1920 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association,[5]\nwhich he also served as president. He was also an elected member of the American Philosophical Society, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[6][7][8]/nIn 1929, Pearl's friend William Morton Wheeler was about to retire as the Dean of the Bussey Institution at Harvard University.  At this time, there were plans to alter the current biological departments and create a field of human biology at Harvard.  Due to his connections at Harvard, Pearl was mentioned as a possible candidate to succeed Wheeler and had many supporters there.  However, Edwin Bidwell Wilson, a Harvard mathematician, was a critic of Pearl and did not believe he was fit for this position.  Wilson believed that great detail and attention should be used when dealing with the math of biological data and thought that Pearl had been messy with his handling and reasoning of math in the field of biology.  Wilson's first issue with Pearl was his study of population growth in the 1920s.  Pearl stated that he discovered the law of population that represented an S-shaped curve of growth, but Wilson thought that his data was insufficient and did not support this assertion.[9]/nDespite his criticism of Pearl, in 1925, Wilson reached out to Pearl for help on his cancer research.  Pearl was unaware of Wilson's criticism of him at the time.  He did not help Wilson because he thought that he did not have a sufficient understanding of the biological and medical fields, which further ignited Wilson's distaste of Pearl.  In 1929, Pearl conducted research on the correlation between tuberculosis and cancer and published a paper that claimed that there is a negative correlation.  This research had mistakes in its data analysis, so Wilson saw this study as an opportunity to attack Pearl and prevent him from becoming the new dean.  Wilson denounced Pearl's use of mathematics in the cancer study to different departments at Harvard and published about it as well.  His efforts paid off as the Board of Overseers at Harvard rejected Pearl's nomination by a vote of ten to nine.  Pearl continued his scientific pursuits at Hopkins until his death.[9]/nPearl was a eugenicist who held traditional Galtonian beliefs.  He wanted to use eugenics and biometry in medicine and public health in order to gain knowledge of human heredity.[10]/nPearl founded the Constitutional Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.  He believed in constitutional medicine, which focuses on examining the soil on which a seed falls.  He later became the director of a new Institute of Biological Research at Johns Hopkins in 1925 that was aimed at examining the genetics and environmental factors of disease.  This research institute combined biometry, genetics, and medicine to investigate the hereditary predisposition of tuberculosis and hypertension.  When conducting his research of these diseases, Pearl recorded the height, weight, handedness, measurements of different body parts, and physical descriptions.  Just like Galton, he believed that race was an important factor in human characteristics and believed in using biology and genetics to improve the long-term health of the population.  Although he tried to be quantitative, objective, and systematic, his classifications of different races were influenced by social norms and prejudices.[10]/nHowever, in the late 1920s, Pearl condemned eugenics.  Pearl criticized the use of race in eugenics despite conducting research that recognized racial differences.  He believed that eugenics was doing the right thing badly and that human biology was eugenics done right if it consisted of reliable statistics, objectivity, a liberal social agenda, and medical affiliations.[10] In 1927, he published the landmark article The Biology of Superiority, which attacked the basic assumptions of eugenics.[11] The article was the first general attack on eugenics by someone perceived as being within the movement.[12] It also contributed to the emergence of reform eugenics and the population control movement./nPearl was an influential member of the Advisory Committee of the World Population Conference,[13] after which Pearl helped found the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population Problems.[12][14] Pearl's ideas about human population growth, which were separable from his ideas about eugenics, owed to both his biological research but also the role he believed population played in the origins of World War I as well as his concern that mass consumption would push against resource limits. His research on population limits helped develop the concept of carrying capacity.[15]/nDespite his apparent rejection of eugenics, Pearl maintained relatively good relations with key eugenicists[16] and expressed classist views.[17] He made statements which have been interpreted as being anti-Semitic.[18] From 1927 to 1932, Pearl and his colleague Alan Meyer were important figures of one of the first birth control clinics in the United States called Baltimore's Bureau for Contraceptive Advice.  Pearl was a supporter of birth control, but had a more conservative and scientific approach when compared to the ideologies of Margaret Sanger.  The clinic performed a eugenic medicine study that looked at how the distribution of birth control information that was provided by a clinic affected society.[10]/nPearl's main focus of interest was in biostatistics.  As one of the first biostatisticians to use mathematics as a way to interpret population genetics, Pearl published a book called Modes of Research in Genetics in 1915 and another book called Introduction to Medical Biometry and Statistics in 1923.  They were both widely read and were influential in showing the importance of statistics in the genetic and medical fields.[4]/nEven though many of his books were well-received, some of his beliefs still caused controversy.  One such belief was that when a brother and sister reproduce, there would not be an increase in homozygosity.  Pearl believed that with brother-sister breeding and no selection past the F3 generation, heterozygosity would not fall below 50%.[4]/nEven though his main interest was biostatistics, Pearl had a wide range of interests in biology and was known for his broad knowledge of the subject.  He published works on animal behavior, population growth, food and prices, Jewish and Christian marriages, and vegetarianism.  In the 1920s and 1930s, Pearl focused on the effect that the environment, which included disease, alcohol, and tobacco, has on longevity.  He published a book called Alcohol and Longevity in 1926, where he claimed that moderate consumption of alcohol could be beneficial for cardiovascular health, which was met with much debate due to prohibition.  Controversy continued when Pearl conducted a study on tobacco in which he demonstrated that smoking decreases longevity while drinking does not.[4]/nPearl is regarded as one of founders of biogerontology. In 1908 Max Rubner observed that mammals of different size and longevity had equal mass specific metabolic output.[19] Partly based on the observation that the longevity of fruit flies varies inversely with ambient temperature,[20] Pearl (like Rubner) also asserted that maximum life span is inversely proportional to basal metabolic rate. Pearl accepted Alexis Carrel's erroneous ideas that normal somatic cells don't age, and that aging must therefore be due to dysfunction at the body level. Pearl speculated that lifespan was limited by vital cell components that were depleted or damaged more rapidly in animals with faster metabolisms.[21] Denham Harman's free-radical theory of aging later provided a plausible causal mechanism for Pearl's hypothesis./nThe Rate of Living Hypothesis enjoyed prominence as one of the foremost theories of aging for nearly 50 years. The Rate of Living Hypothesis is undermined by the observation that a rat and a bat have similar metabolic rate, but a bat lives several times longer.[22] More recently, further doubts have been raised on the Rate of Living Hypothesis by the demonstration that, when modern statistical methods for correcting for the effects of body size and phylogeny are employed, metabolic rate does not correlate with longevity in mammals or birds.[23] (For a critique of the Rate of Living Hypothesis see Living fast, dying when?.[24])/nPearl was widely known for his lust for life and his love of food, drink, music and parties.[25] He was a key member of the Saturday Night Club which also included H. L. Mencken.[26][27] Prohibition made no dent in Pearl's drinking habits (which were legendary)./nRaymond Pearl is, also, known for his population biology work, as in his 1928 volume, The Rate of Living: Being an Account of Some Experimental Studies on the Biology of Life Duration.   In this book, he presents extensive research regarding population density effects on life duration in fruit flies, demonstrating that an optimal population density existed for that insect in his experimental model.  This raised the question of whether or not the same effect might not occur in other species, including humans.  His work demonstrating longer lifespans for flies with lower metabolic rates, also, raised the question of whether or not a similar phenomenon might be found in other species, including humans.  Thus, he became a mentor to John B. Calhoun, famous for his ecological studies of rodent populations and their possible importance for modern humans.  Population density effects on duration of life is thought, by population biologists, to be Raymond Pearl's greatest contribution to biological science./nIn November 1940, Pearl was in apparently good health and paid a visit to the Baltimore Zoo. He cut his trip short complaining of chest pains and died later that day.", "51179337": "Ernst Berliner (15 September 1880 \u2013 1 October 1957) was a German scientist with contributions to microbiology, entomology, and biochemistry./nErnst Berliner was born in Berlin to Albrecht Berliner and Hedwig (n\u00e9e Koppen).

The primary nutrients that are limiting to the growth of bacteria inside vertebrates are metals, because vertebrates have developed numerous metal chelation systems that serve as a host defense against microbial infection. This is one of the aspects of the general concept called nutritional immunity. The Skaar laboratory is interested in identifying the host and bacterial factors that are involved in this competition for metal during the  host-pathogen interaction.

Catling is a Professor in Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington.

He has participated in NASA's Mars exploration program[1] and contributed research to help find life elsewhere in the solar system and on planets orbiting other stars.[2][3] He is also known for his work on the evolution of Earth's atmosphere and biosphere,[4] including how Earth's atmosphere became rich in oxygen,[5] allowing complex life to evolve,[6][7] and conditions conducive to the origin of life.[8][9][10]/nDavid Catling completed a D.Phil. in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford in 1994. After working as a postdoctoral scholar and then research scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center from 1995-2001, he became a professor at the University of Washington in 2001. Since 2012, he has been a full professor at the University of Washington./nIn the area of the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere, Catling is known for a theory explaining how the Earth's crust accumulated large quantities of oxidized minerals and how the atmosphere became rich in oxygen.[11]  Geological records show that oxygen flooded the atmosphere in a Great Oxidation Event (GOE) starting about 2.4 billion years ago, even though bacteria that produced oxygen likely evolved hundreds of millions of years earlier. Catling's theory proposes that biological oxygen was initially used by reactions with chemicals in the environment; gradually, however, Earth's environment shifted to a tipping point where oxygen flooded the air. Atmospheric methane is the key part of this theory. Before oxygen was abundant, methane gas could reach concentrations hundreds or thousands of times greater than today's 1.8 parts per million. Ultraviolet light decomposes methane molecules in the upper atmosphere, causing hydrogen gas to escape into space. Over time, the irreversible atmospheric escape of hydrogen\u2013 a powerful reducing agent -caused Earth to oxidize and reach the GOE tipping point.[12] Measurements of atmospheric xenon in ancient seawater trapped inside old rocks, published since the 2010s, supports the theory: Earth's atmospheric xenon and its lighter isotopes were most plausibly lost by being dragged out to space by vigorously escaping hydrogen.[13]/nOther studies about Earth's atmospheric oxygen have considered its second increase around 600 million years ago acted as a precursor to the rise of animal life. Catling proposed looking at oxygen-sensitive variations in stable isotopes of selenium to trace atmospheric and seawater oxygen, and the results of such a study showed that Earth's second increase in oxygen occurred in fits and starts spread over about 100 million years.[14][15]/nCatling also contributed to the first measurements of Earth's atmospheric thickness billions of years ago. He helped pioneer two techniques: using fossil raindrop imprints to set an upper limit on air density, which was applied to fossil imprints from 2.7 billion years ago,[16][17] and using fossil bubbles in ancient lava flows, which suggests that air pressure 2.7 billion years ago was less than half that of the modern atmosphere.[18][19]/nCatling has also researched the evolution of the atmosphere and surface of Mars.[20] In the 1990s, he pioneered research on how the types of salts from dried-up lakes or seas on Mars could indicate the past environment and whether Mars was habitable.[21] Since then, the discovery of salts and clays from former lakebeds has been a key success of missions to Mars by NASA and ESA. Catling was on the Science Team for NASA's Phoenix Lander mission, which in 2008 was the first spacecraft to land in the ice-rich high latitudes of Mars. Catling contributed to research that included the first scoops by a lander of water ice from below the surface of Mars[22] and the first measurement of soluble salts in martian soil, including the soil pH.[23] In experimental work with Jonathan Toner to examine low-temperature solutions of perchlorate salts, as found on Mars, Toner and Catling discovered that such solutions super cool and never crystallize.[24] The perchlorates form glasses (amorphous solids) around -120\u00a0\u00b0C. Glasses are known to be far better for preserving microbes and biological molecules than crystalline salts, which could be relevant to the search for life on Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus./nIn the field of planetary atmospheres, David Catling and Tyler Robinson proposed a general explanation for a curious observation: the minimum air temperature between the troposphere (the lowest atmospheric layer where temperature declines with altitude) and stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude in an 'inversion') occurs a pressure of about 0.1 bar on Earth, Titan, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. This level is the tropopause. Robinson and Catling used the physics of radiation to explain why the tropopause temperature minimum in these extremely different atmospheres occurs at a common pressure.[25]  They propose that pressure around 0.1 bar could be a fairly general rule for planets with stratospheric temperature inversions. This rule could constrain the atmospheric structure of exoplanets and hence their surface temperature and habitability./nWork by Catling and his students is also the first to accurately quantify the thermodynamic disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres of the Solar System, which has been proposed as a means to look for life remotely.[2][26][27]/nDavid Catling has authored over 150 scientific articles or book chapters.

Her parents were Daniel Eugene Carmon, a schoolteacher, and Margarite Wilson Carmon, a homemaker.[1] She was 8th of 11 children.[2] In an interview for Lifeology, Nicol explained that despite her family having very little: \"we used to have a lot of fun. You couldn't grow up any better than that.\"[2] As their local school was underfunded, and only went up to the eighth grade, Nicol's father took it upon himself to give the children extra homeschooling.[2]/nDuring her high school years, Nicol worked as a domestic to earn money.[3] When she graduated from high school, Nicol was offered a scholarship at Tuskegee University to study Home Economics.[2] She moved to Alabama in 1949 to attend university,[3] but she chose to study Mathematics and Chemistry instead of Home Economics.[2] She funded her studies by working two jobs.[2] Nicol graduated at the top of her class in 1953 with a degree in Chemistry and Mathematics, and earned the Beta Kappa Chi and Alpha Kappa Mu honors.[1][3]/nFrom 1953 to 1955, Nicol worked as a research assistant for the Salk Polio Project of the Carver Research Foundation.[3][2] Under the supervision of Dr. Russel W. Brown, she worked on developing the first polio vaccine using HeLa cell cultures.[2] Nicol then joined the Cleveland City Hospital, working with Frederick C. Robbins and John F. Enders.[1] There, she was the first person to successfully isolate the herpes zoster virus, which causes shingles, using amniotic cells in tissue culture.[1][2][3] In an interview for Lifeology, Nicol said: \"Things just come to me. I don't know why. It just seems like common sense.\"[2]/nFollowing these her early career successes, Nicol was recruited by Rand Development Corporation, where she worked on isolating the leukemia agent.[1] During this time, Nicol also worked for the University of Kansas Medical Centre, and the Michael Reese Hospital.[1]/nNicol then joined Abbott Laboratories as a research assistant in 1962.[2] There, she faced discrimination from her white colleagues, who would take credit for results and sabotage her work.[2] On 6 January 1976, Nicol patented a new technique to increase the production yield of  urokinase (U.S. Patent No. 3,930,944),[4] an enzyme used to dissolve blood clots.[1] She was one of the few African American women to be awarded a patent in molecular biology at that time.[2] Among her many achievements while working at Abbott, Nicol successfully developed a test for toxoplasmosis in pregnant women, and an interferon assay.[2]/nIn 1985, Nicol was recruited by Baxter Pharmaceuticals.[1] Within their hepatitis research and development group, known as Pandex, Nicol led the retrovirology division, which produced testing kits for blood-borne diseases such as HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus.[5][2][3] Two blind studies funded by Abbott Pharmaceuticals determined that the testing kits produced under Nicol's leadership were the best available.[1] While at Baxter pharmaceuticals, Nicol used her seniority to combat workplace discrimination, and advocate for fairer hiring practices.[2][3] For example, she hired Linda Smith, whose resume had initially been rejected, likely because she had studied at a historically Black university.[2]/nWhile she was working there, Pandex was bought by Nicol's former employer Abbott Laboratories. Nicol retired in 1990, refusing to work for a company that had been so openly discriminatory.[2][3]/nNicol had three children.[2] Upon retirement, she lived in Waukegan, Illinois, and later in Weston, Connecticut.[3] Retirement allowed Evelyn to partake in her many hobbies such as oil painting, bridge, and tennis to name a few.[2] At the age of 89, Nicol was hospitalized for a stroke, and was diagnosed with COVID-19.

Raguso (born January 30, 1965) is an American biologist and professor at Cornell University in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior.[1] He has expanded the field of chemical ecology by introducing and pioneering floral scent as a key component of plant-pollinator communication, with special focus on hawkmoths and Clarkia plants./nRobert Andrew Raguso was born on January 30, 1965, in Englewood, New Jersey. At age 5, Raguso was introduced to his first cecropia moth by Campbell Norsgaard, a film maker and naturalist, as a part of the \"Broader Impacts\" activities advocated by the National Science Foundation. This encounter sparked Raguso's interest in moths which has continued for 50 years. Raguso started his research career as a high schooler during the summers of 1982 and 1983, working as a technician in the laboratory of Columbia University Professor Darcy Kelley, who taught summers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.[2]/nRaguso's interests expanded from moths to butterflies, and his love for the biological diversity of Lepidoptera led him to study butterflies with Professor Charles Remington at Yale University. During the summer of 1985, Raguso expanded his biological interests and pursued field research at a variety of destinations. At Mountain Lake Biological Station in the Southern Appalachians of Virginia, Raguso developed a lifelong fascination with pollination while studying nectar variance and risk aversion by bees with Professors Beverly Rathcke (later a key figure in his graduate years) and Leslie Real. Raguso also traveled to Laguna Encantada near Catemaco in Veracruz, Mexico, where he initiated a butterfly survey with Professors Carol C. Horvitz and Doug Schemske[2] that would eventually become his first publication.[3] Raguso also completed a senior honors thesis on the biodiversity of interior Colias butterfly populations, which had been separated anywhere from 8 to 12,000 generations due to the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.[2]/nRaguso graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in biology and minoring in art history. Following graduation, Raguso spent two years working as a technician in the Stanford University laboratory of Professor Ward Watt, an accomplished former student of Charles Remington. Under Watt's guidance, Raguso broadened his understanding of evolutionary genetics and functional ecology, caring for thousands of caterpillars of Colias butterflies, taking classes, and learning research techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis./nIn 1989, Raguso moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to start doctoral studies with Eran Pichersky. There, with encouragement from Rathcke and Michael Martin, he developed methodologies to test evolutionary hypotheses on the functional importance of floral scent. Raguso learned to collect and analyze floral volatiles, mastering gas chromatography and molecular spectroscopy (GC-MS) as he worked midnight-to-dawn shifts in the university's chemistry labs. Through bioassay-guided fractionation, Raguso isolated the individual molecules contributing to the floral scents of two lines of Clarkia breweri as well as its suspected progenitor, Clarkia concinna. Evolutionary shifts in scent produced by these flowers contributed to a parallel change in the pollinator identities of these flowers. In 1995, Raguso earned his PhD after completing his thesis \"Mechanisms of floral scent production and hawkmoth pollination in Clarkia breweri (Onagraceae)\".[4] Through this work, Raguso laid a critical foundation for further research involving floral volatiles./nIn 1996, Raguso embarked on postdoctoral studies at the University of Arizona, guiding his research interests back to hawkmoths under the mentoring of Professors John Hildebrand and Lucinda McDade. Funded through the Center for Insect Science, Raguso worked after sunset with Mark Willis in the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, piecing together the multimodal feeding behavior\u2014a combination of visual and olfactory stimuli\u2014of hawkmoths when visiting Datura flowers. Further postdoctoral studies involved mapping floral volatiles onto phylogenetic relationships, particularly in the context of hawkmoth pollination disappearing and reappearing repeatedly in three plant lineages.[2]/nRaguso started a faculty position at the University of South Carolina in 1999, served as a visiting professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal between 2006 and 2007, and moved to Cornell (replacing the \"father of chemical ecology\", Tom Eisner)  in 2007, where he currently serves as a professor. More on Raguso's professional preparation and scientific development can be found here./nRaguso has continued to develop the study of floral scents and their importance in the pollination of wild plants over the past decades.[5] He is cited for behavioral studies of insects, flowers, plant chemical ecology, and integrating physiology and evolutionary theory to understand the mechanistic basis of pollination. To date, his research has resulted in over 150 peer-reviewed scientific publications and over 7,000 citations by his peers.[5] He is the past chairperson of his department at Cornell.[6][7]/nRaguso's laboratory studies signal evolution from the standpoints of both the producer (plants) and receiver (insects).[8] In each of several study systems, he and his students have dissected the importance of plant volatile organic compounds in pollination and coevolution between species.[9] He has a long-standing interest in plants in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae), including Oenothera[10] and Clarkia[11] species.  From the insect perspective, Raguso has focused on hawkmoths (especially Manduca species) and has investigated their use of floral scent,[12] humidity,[13] and carbon dioxide[14] produced in flowers. Manduca perceive these cues and use them opportunistically. In addition to flowering plants, Raguso has published on mosses and fungi that use color and scent to trick flies into dispersing their spores to rotting substrates.[15] His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation,[16][17][18] National Geographic Society,[19] and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation./nRaguso has been an invited lecturer at universities, public gardens, and classes.[20][21] In addition to his work at Cornell, Raguso teaches a field course on volatile analysis at Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory[22] and has been a visiting instructor for a variety of ecological and behavioral courses in Chile, Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain, and Germany.[23] Raguso is the co-founder of the Gordon Research Conference on Floral Volatiles.[24] Raguso is a Fulbright senior fellow,[25][23] National Geographic Explorer,[19] and recipient of the 2017 Silverstein-Simeone Award from the International Society of Chemical Ecology.[26] Raguso has two children with his wife, Dr. Laurel Hester, assistant provost at Keuka College,[27] with whom he currently resides in Ithaca, New York.", "46722965": "Pierre-Victor or Pierre Victor Galtier ((1846-10-15)15 October 1846\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(1908-04-24)24 April 1908) was a veterinarian and professor at the National Veterinary School of Lyon\u00a0[fr], specialising in pathology of infectious diseases, health surveillance and commercial and medical legislation. He developed a rabies vaccine which had some experimental success in laboratory animals./nGaltier was born on 15 October 1846 in Langogne, Loz\u00e8re to a farmer's family.[1] In 1853, he was entrusted to the nuns who ran the local school. He escaped from this school twice, only to be placed with his grandmother who lived in Langogne. There, he attended secondary school, leaving after the tenth grade./nHe read Greco-Roman studies at La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin in the \"Petit S\u00e9minaire\", the famous ecclesiastical secondary school of Bishop Felix Dupanloup, an outpost of the Seminar d'Orl\u00e9ans. He received his bachelor's degree with honours./nHe studied for his master's degree and his veterinary license at Marvejols college. Around this time Loz\u00e8re created a scholarship to help poor students to study to become veterinarians, which Galtier received and used to study at the National Veterinary School of Lyon\u00a0[fr]. He came top of the class for four consecutive years, and graduated in 1873 as a valedictorian, receiving the \"Grand prix Bourgelat\"./nGaltier began his professional career as an associate of Monsieur Delorme, a veterinarian in Arles, whose daughter he married. He began teaching veterinary pathology and eventually became the Chair of Infectious Diseases. Aged 33, he began his work on rabies./nIn 1876, he was appointed the Chair of Pathology and Internal Medicine in the veterinary science department at Lyon. In 1877, his department began to carry out studies on microbial pathology and microbiology. This led to the school supporting the idea of contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, the common cold, and rabies, as opposed to the National Veterinary School of Alfort which supported the idea of spontaneous generation./nIn 1878 he was appointed professor of pathology of infectious diseases, animal health, trade and medical law. In the same year, Mr. Bouley, Inspector General of veterinary schools, created a new department that would separate the teaching of general pathology from that of communicable diseases. Pierre Victor Galtier was appointed to the department chair and held the position for 30 years./nIn 1879, he made important discoveries about two deadly diseases: common cold and rabies. In 1883, he obtained a law degree./nFor his work on rabies, Galtier was considered for the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. However, he died in La Mulati\u00e8re on 24 April 1908, thereby preventing his nomination.[2][3]/nPierre Galtier was notable for his work on rabies; he was the first to develop a vaccine for rabies. He also made important advances in the study of the common cold and on the infectiousness of viruses./nGaltier assumed that, because of the incubation period of rabies, the development of a vaccine could be used as curative for a disease like this.[5]/nHis first publication on rabies was a thesis entitled \"Studies on rabies\" published in two veterinary journals[6][7][8] and whose findings are published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences./nOn 25 April 1879, the Academy of Sciences published his notes on rabies.[9]/nThe article made clear his conclusions about rabies:/nGaltier also had a brilliant idea: he began experiments to find an agent capable of neutralizing rabies virus. He thought that the discovery of an effective preventive was almost equivalent to the discovery of a cure, especially if it was effective when administered within a day or two of an infected bite.[5] It is this 'genius idea which is the basis of preventive treatment for rabies by vaccination'./nIn 1880, Galtier published a \"Treaty of contagious diseases\" which contains a chapter on rabies.[b]/nIn this book, he wrote this sentence summarizing his first observations on immunity to rabies: \"Rabies virus injected directly into the blood stream is ineffective, at least this is what I found in several experiences where I had injected into the jugular vein of the sheep a large amount of rabid drool\".[10] His experiments were published in several articles the following year./nAlso in 1880, Louis Pasteur became interested in rabies and took note of Galtier's work, regarding him with a certain disdain, stating that these experiments \"do not make it possible to reconicle, let alone identify the disease [\u2026] as rabies\". Pasteur often denigrated his predecessors before taking over their work, and the credit for it; he also did this with Henri Toussaint and Antoine B\u00e9champ./nIn August 1881, Galtier sent a note to the Academy of Sciences.[11] He noted his experiences of the intravenous inoculation of the rabies virus in the bloodstream./nHe wrote:/nThe findings that emerge from these facts are the following:/nThis method provided immunity against rabies in sheep. In the Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine, he wrote: \"I injected the rabies saliva into the jugular vein of sheep seven times, and never saw rabies, one of my test subjects was successively inoculated with saliva from a rabid dog, four months after this inoculation, the animal is alive and well; he seems to have acquired immunity. I inoculated him for another fortnight by putting eight cubic centimeters of rabid saliva in the peritoneum; it always went very well; then I would administer him another inoculation.\"[12]/nAccording to the science historian Jean Th\u00e9odorid\u00e8s, this is the first time in the history of medicine that the idea of immunization against rabies was supported by convincing experimental results.[13]/nGaltier remarked \"intravenous inoculation is ineffective. [But] immunity follows this inoculation in sheep\", and he noted the absence of virus in the nerve centers./nThis last point drew the attention of Louis Pasteur who saw a lack of sensitivity due to the subcutaneous inoculation technique. With his student \u00c9mile Roux, Pasteur developed an intracranial inoculation, by trepanning the skull of a dog. This isolated the virus in the nerve centers, and supported the idea that rabies is neurotropic, meaning that the virus preferentially develops in nerve cells, and spreads through nerve pathways from the peripheral inoculation point to the brain./nIn 1883, \u00c9mile Roux published his medical doctorate thesis on \"New acquisitions on rabies.\" According to Jean Th\u00e9odorid\u00e8s,[14] the most striking thing about Roux's thesis is the frequent mention of the work of Galtier, whereas Pasteur referred to Galtier only incidentally.[15]/nIn 1886, Galtier published an important book on rabies, Rabies considered in animals and humans from the point of view of its character and its prophylaxis (French: La rage envisag\u00e9e chez les animaux et chez l'homme au point de vue de ses caract\u00e8res et de sa prophylaxie). It discussed:[13]/nIt reviewed Galtier's research of 1879\u20131881, and reported that research was continuing as of 1886 (the date of publication of the book).[13]/nThe book also dealt with health measures and forensics, dog control measures (wearing the collar, a muzzle, leash).[13]/nIn 1887, Galtier received the Barbier Prize (French: Prix Barbier) from the Acad\u00e9mie nationale de m\u00e9decine for his work on rabies./nIn its report on awarding the Barbier Prize to Galtier, Edmond Nocard wrote: \"The discovery of Mr. Galtier, therefore, has a high importance not only from the scientific point of view but also in practical point of view; it is hoped that it will soon lead to the establishment of a simple, practical and effective treatment, saving the largest number of bitten animals.\"[16]/nThe same year, he received the Br\u00e9ant Price of the Academy of Sciences (December 1887) for his book on rabies. Bouchard, on behalf of the Commission consisting of Marey, Charcot, Brown- S\u00e9quard and Verneuil emphasized the importance of the work of several years preceding those of Louis Pasteur.[17]/nOn 30 January 1888, Galtier published an article in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences.[18] He insisted that \"the rabies virus retains its activity in buried corpses, so that when doubts arise afterwards about the nature of the disease that caused the death, exhumation, and inoculation of the bulb are naturally indicated\".[19]/nFor Galtier (a veterinary professor, qualified in medical law and contagious diseases), the consequence of the persistence of the rabies virus meant that, in cases of question of the liability of animal owners, corpses could be exhumed to confirm a diagnosis of rabies.[20]/nOn 16 April 1888, he again sent a note.[21] He recalled his experiences in 1880\u20131881 showing that injection of the rabies virus in the veins of sheep and goats did not cause rabies, but instead conferred immunity.[22] He noted that research in 1884 by Edmond Nocard and Emile Roux confirmed the validity of these deductions.[23] These authors noted that intravenous injection can prevent rabies after inoculation into the eye, and after the bite of a rabid animal.[13]/nIn his article, Galtier also related his experiments on sheep./nThe second edition of Galtier's On Contagious Diseases was published in 1891. Galtier was disappointed, to the point of physical pain,[24] by the negative remarks from Louis Pasteur about his research. Pateur stated that dogs did not acquire immunity, as Galtier found in sheep and goats, following intravenous injection of rabies.[17] However, Edmond Nocard and Emile Roux had already confirmed in 1888 that their experiments of 1884 had confirmed Galtier's experiments of 1881.[13]/nIn 1904, Galtier lost four of his eight children and his wife, and was strongly discouraged.[5]/nHe published an article entitled \"Pages of history\"[25] in which he wrote: \"\u2026 I had studied first, from 1879-80-81, the effects of intravenous injection of the rabies virus. I was the first to demonstrate, in the most peremptory manner, its safety in herbivorous animals, and immunizing action. I established this first, before there was any thought of vaccination Pasteur or any others, that immunity against deadly rabies could be granted to certain animals by a particular method of inoculation \u2026 From 1881 onward, I had shown that virus injected into the veins of sheep and goats does not cause rabies, but confers immunity\"./nIn this article, he promoted is pioneering rabies immunizations, stressing that the results achieved in small ruminants (sheep and goats) were confirmed by Edmond Nocard and Emile Roux in 1888.[26][27]/nIn 1907, Galtier received a significant token of esteem from the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm, who asked him to send all his work on rabies to offer his candidacy Nobel Prize of physiology and medicine for the year 1908.[28] However, Galtier was never nominated for a Nobel Prize;[29] as his death most likely interrupted the nomination process.[29]/nGaltier also wrote several works on the intimate nature of the tissues on the infectiousness of the virus./nHe wrote two books on Health regulation and legislation of its relationship with the pet trade and on The Treaty of contagious diseases and animal health./nGaltier focused mainly on infectious diseases of domestic animals: rabies, the common cold, tuberculosis, anthrax, and pneumococcal enteritis.[8]", "59797404": "Stacey B.

Rose Canton originated during the Golden Age of comics, and Rhosyn \"Rose\" Forrest during the Silver Age. Until the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Canton and Forrest were from Earth-Two and Earth-One respectively,  of the DC Multiverse.[1]/nThorn (Rose Canton) is a woman with a split personality whose villainous personality has the ability to control plants.[2] Initially, she and her hired thugs opposed the Flash. After being (apparently) cured of her Thorn persona, Rose married Alan Scott and had two children, Jennie-Lynn Hayden and Todd James Rice by him. After a resurgence of her madness, she left Scott and put her children up for adoption, then went into seclusion for many years. She finally resurfaced and faced the Justice Society several times before her sanity returned, and she committed suicide./nAs a child, Rose Canton used an imaginary friend, \"Thorn\", to deflect blame for bad things that she did. Over the years, Thorn developed as a distinct persona in Rose's head. As an adult, Rose was studying biology on the island of Tashmi, where she was exposed to the sap of a jungle root, which transformed her into Thorn. After killing her teacher, Professor Hollis, she reverted to Rose. Rose returned to America and settled in Keystone City where Thorn headed a gang which harassed the Flash. When she was in control, Rose would approach Jay for help, claiming to be Thorn's sister./nThe Amazons of Paradise Island undertook her psychological treatment and apparently managed to rid Rose of the Thorn persona. During the time of her recovery, Rose developed a crush on Alan Scott. Dyeing her hair black, she assumed the identity of Alyx Florin and romantically pursued him, leading to their marriage. Tragedy struck when, on their honeymoon, Thorn returned. The personality of Rose was able to prevent Thorn from killing Alan, but she chose to run, preferring Alan to believe that she had perished in the fire that consumed their cabin. Their brief honeymoon resulted in the conception of twins, the children who were to become Jade and Obsidian. Fearful that Thorn might kill them, she gave the children up for adoption./nThorn continued to fight Alan, who was still unaware of his wife's alter ego. On the island of Tashmi, she faced her husband and two children, both now adults. To keep Thorn from killing them, Rose fatally stabbed herself in the heart.[3]/nIn 2011, The New 52 rebooted the DC universe. A one-shot take on Rose and Thorn was published as part of the National Comics line in September 2012, written by Tom Taylor and drawn by Neil Googe.[4] This version is a teenage girl Rose Canton, who is just returning to school after being institutionalized following the death of her father. The shy Rose discovers that she has a violent and sexually adventurous split personality Thorn who is determined to find her father's murderers.[5]/nA second character was created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist Ross Andru in the 12-page Lois Lane story \"Death House Honeymoon\" in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #105 (October 1970), with her own series, \"Rose and the Thorn\", debuting that issue as the title's backup feature.[6][7]/nRhosyn \"Rose\" Forrest is the daughter of Metropolis police officer Phil Forrest, who was killed by a criminal gang named The 100. When Rose went to sleep, her Thorn personality would emerge and stalk the streets as a vigilante, attempting to bring The 100 to justice. When she succeeds in bringing The 100 to justice, the \"Thorn\" personality subsides. Eventually, however, the gang escapes and forms another group, called The 1000, and her alternate personality resurfaces. She has since worked with Superman and Booster Gold to try to put these criminals behind bars. She was briefly under the control of Lord Satanus./nThorn has no actual superpowers, but she is highly athletic and learned martial arts from her father. She is known to carry a pair of combat daggers, a barbed whip, and a bandolier of tiny, thorn-shaped weapons, some of which contain explosives, miniature smoke bombs, or blinding magnesium flares./nIn the 1990s, Thorn appeared in a Green Arrow storyline written by Chuck Dixon. After trying to defeat a Metropolis crime lord, Thorn was defeated by Eddie Fyers and taken prisoner. After being tied up and gagged in a supply closet, Thorn reverted to her Rose persona and began to sob, frightened and confused about what was happening. Her sobs were heard by Green Arrow, who had rescued her earlier. They eventually teamed up to take down the crime lord after she returned to her Thorn persona.[8]/nWhen Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy moved to Metropolis, Thorn immediately attacked them. After a fierce battle, the women left Thorn hanging bound and gagged from a Superman statue in a local park for all of the citizens to see.[9] During a later confrontation, Harley and Ivy defeat Thorn again, this time kidnapping her and keeping her tied up in their garden. After removing the vines from her mouth, Harley drugs Thorn into revealing the secrets about her multiple personality. Ivy then tortures Thorn in order to prove that she's weak, eventually leaving her in the care of Bizarro while she takes a break. Although, she is later rescued by Supergirl, who defeats Bizarro and unties Thorn. Supergirl later reveals that she just happened to stumble into the garden. Thorn and Supergirl later ambush and capture Ivy and turn her into the police./nA 2004 Rose & Thorn miniseries by Gail Simone provided a slightly different origin story. In this version, The 100 killed both her parents, but Rhosyn was now revealed to have, at age 12, fought back and mutilated their murderer, Mr. Quince, cutting his hand off. She was then placed into a psychiatric care home, where she constantly flew into violent outbursts. Rhosyn's multiple personality is a result of unethical experimental treatments by a psychiatrist named Dr. Chritlow. The experiments forced her to repress her more violent, base emotions; these emotions were then given to the buried \"Thorn\" personality, who emerged whenever the submissive Rose felt angry or threatened. Her Thorn personality finally broke out after Rose's roommate Kimmy was burned to death by another patient. Enraged, Thorn viciously mutilated the culprit. Once released into the public, Thorn began taking over more frequently, taking up a role as an ultra-violent vigilante in a quest to take down The 100 and avenge her parents. By the end of the miniseries, it was hinted that she had killed the head of The 100 while he was in the hospital./nIn the miniseries, Gail Simone gave Rhosyn an uncle and godfather, Detective Curtis Leland, who was secretly taking bribes from The 100 and had been unable to stop them killing Rhosyn's parents. Wracked with guilt and determined to protect his goddaughter, he disposed of two 100 grunts that Thorn had dispatched. Curtis was killed while trying to prevent Quince from killing Rhosyn. In his final moments, he put a signed confession in his pocket so the police could arrest them./nIt was also revealed that Rose and Thorn are not the only two personalities in Rhosyn's mind. The other two shown have been \"Mom\", a caring and maternal figure much like how Rose remembers their mother, and \"Wild Rose\", an Irish vigilante who is even more vicious and punitive than Thorn./nShe encountered the Birds of Prey in the Hero Hunters storyline. As of Birds of Prey #98, she is employed at Dinah Lance's flower shop, Sherwood Florist II.[10] Her most recent appearance was in Birds of Prey #108, where she makes an appearance as one of the heroines called in to confront and intimidate Spy Smasher.[11]/nIn 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called DC Rebirth, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to \"The New 52\". Rose and Thorn appeared in September 2019 as part of the relaunch of the Legion of Superheroes under Brian Michael Bendis and Szymon Kudranski.[12] This version of Rose is likewise dual-personalitied, and had a few run-ins with various heroes (including at one point waking up in Arkham Asylum) before medication developed by Lex Luthor suppressed her Thorn Personality, allowing her to live a normal life and get married. In this story, Rose is immortal (though she did not notice until they stopped making the medicine she took to suppress her Thorn persona, as the condition was now genetically corrected at birth). She goes to an aged Supergirl for help, but apparently does not receive it as her Thorn personality is later seen going on a murderous rampage against the criminal element in Neo Gotham. She lives on Earth unaging for over 1000 years, encountering a number of other prominent future characters including Batman Beyond and Kamandi. She is important in the founding of the Legion. [13]/nExposure to the sap of a rare tropical plant gave Rose Canton's Thorn personality limited control over plant life, especially those with thorny stalks. The sap was also responsible for physically transforming Rose into the evil Thorn. She also has the ability to spin rapidly like a top.

A Zionist and humanist, he was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, educated in the United States and spent most of his career in Mandatory Palestine, but died before the creation of the State of Israel. He was one of the first four professors of the Hebrew University and the founder of Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology of the university, which he headed until his death in 1944. Kligler was one of the pioneers of modern medical research in Mandatory Palestine, studying as varied a field as Bacteriology, Parasitology, Virology, Nutrition, Epidemiology and Public Health. He developed the Kligler Iron Agar medium for the isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria, which is still in use today.[1]/nKligler's was a key contributor to the eradication of malaria in Mandatory Palestine, a task that was completed after his death.[2][3][4][5]/nIsrael Jacob Kligler was born in the town of Kopychyntsi, then in Galicia, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and today in western Ukraine. He was the son of Aaron Kligler and Fruma (n\u00e9e Fajgel Frima Silberman[6]). His mother died before Israel's 8th birthday, and his father subsequently remarried Sara. In 1900, his father immigrated to the US with his two older daughters, followed in September 1901 by his wife Sara and the other children including Israel Jacob./nKligler attended New York City public schools and earned his Bachelor of Science degree with distinction from the City College of New York in 1911. He continued his studies in Bacteriology, Pathology and Biochemistry at Columbia University:M.A (1914), Ph.D. (1915). The focus of his Ph.D. thesis was oral bacteria with special attention to dental caries.\n[7]/nIn parallel to his studies Kligler started working as an assistant in the Department of Public Health at the American Museum of Natural History in New York (1911\u20131915). He left New York in 1916 and worked for a few months as a Fellow in the Department of Bacteriology of Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago.  In August 1916, he returned to New York where he joined The Rockefeller Institute for medical research until 1920. At Rockefeller, Kligler conducted research commissioned by the Board of Directors on soil contamination, rural sanitation and intestinal bacteria. In 1918, he was drafted into the US Army and served as an instructor of bacteriology in the military station located at the Rockefeller Institute.  Kligler became a member of the Yellow Fever Commission and at the end of World War I was sent by the Rockefeller Institute to Mexico and Peru (1919/1920) where he served as the deputy of the head of the delegation, the bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi.[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11][12]\nSoon after returning from South America, Kligler left the Rockefeller Institute and the US for Palestine, arriving in Eretz Israel in early 1921 as part of the Third Aliyah. However, he retained working contacts with the Rockefeller Foundation, and in 1926, before joining the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, he took part in a yellow fever mission organized by the Rockefeller Foundation to West Africa.[13]/nIn his youth, Kligler had joined the Zionist movement in the USA. Many years later, he wrote after the death of US Supreme Court Judge Louis D Brandeis:/n\"The Jewish youth in 1910 considered Brandeis as a hero, someone whom we admired and worked for. When we had learned that he had accepted to head the Zionist Federation in the United States, we, the Zionist pupils, were extremely enthusiastic. The fact that a man who symbolised the finer side of life in the USA was eager to share his destiny with his people; it was like a dream that became a reality\"./nTowards the end of World War 1, Henrietta Szold and the Hadassah organization established the \"American Zionist Medical Unit\" (AZMU). Kligler, who had dreamt for a long time of making 'Aliyah', wanted to be in the first professional medical health group that arrived in Palestine in July 1918, to help the Jews after the misery experienced during the war. But Miss Szold and Simon Flexner, the first director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901-1935), convinced Kligler to stay at the Rockefeller Institute to gain experience and training for the tasks that awaited him in Eretz Israel. Based on his personal correspondence, after returning from South America Kligler wrote to Miss Szold on 20 July 1920: \"I believe I am ready now\".[14]\nAt the end of October 1920, a party was held at the Rockefeller Institute, to which the heads, managers and researchers came to say goodbye to a highly promising young researcher, who was about to leave for a remote, desolate country, where scientific work had hardly taken place. In January 1921, Kligler arrived in the Holy Land, and began working as a manager of the laboratories of the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, located then in Prophets Street./nIn Jerusalem Kligler met his wife Helen (Ahuva) Friedman who was born in Kisvarda, Hungary on 1 November 1890. Helen studied for three years at the Lebanon Hospital, New York and became a registered nurse in 1914. During World War 1, Helen volunteered for the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) and after the war she volunteered for the AZMU and arrived at the Hadassah Hospital in 1919. Israel Kligler and Helen were married in The Bronx, New York on 11 November 1922, and spent their honeymoon on the way back to Palestine on the deck of the biggest ship of that time, RMS Majestic, leaving New York 16 December 1922. The new family moved to Haifa where Israel Kligler directed the \"Malaria Research Unit\" which was established by the \"Joint Distribution Committee\" in September 1922 and was attached to the Health Department of Palestine. Helen became a supervisor on behalf of the Hadassah organization for the prenatal care of the women of Haifa.[15] Later, in November 1931 Helen became a member of the Social Work Council in Palestine together with Miss Szold, Dr Helena Kagan, Mrs Rachel Katznelson-Shazar and others./nIn 1925, Kligler was invited by Dr Judah Leon Magnes of the Hebrew University, which had just opened, to join the university. Kligler agreed, and on 1 April 1926 began work at the university. He established the Department of Hygiene and Bacteriology which he directed until his death from a heart attack in Netanya, Mandatory Palestine on 23 September 1944. He was buried in the cemetery on Mount of Olives, Jerusalem.[16] Helen died in New York January 1979. Their only child David was born 28 March 1926. David Aaron Kligler MD, MPH was devoted to the Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was involved with the development of the Speech and Hearing Program in New York. David died on 30 December 1979, and he is buried on the Mount of Olives close to the common grave presumed to be containing his father's remains (see below under \"Grave\")./nKligler began publishing research papers at the age of 24, immediately after his graduation. His studies at that time dealt with the classification of bacteria and their biochemical properties. He used his knowledge of their growth needs in order to develop a new medium \u2013\n'Kligler Iron Agar'[17]\n[18] for which he gained an international reputation. His scientific research philosophy was that basic research must also be applied, useful and relevant and that scientific research must not be conducted for its own sake but to make a contribution towards a better life. Before his Aliyah to Palestine, he published 43 articles on intestinal bacteria, diphtheria, streptococci, leptospira and yellow fever. Some of them, such as those relating to environmental bacterial and oral flora, were pioneering works./nKligler arrived in Palestine in 1921. He had a vision, along with many other idealistic Zionists, of Jewish self-determination in Palestine. Control of malaria was a vital goal, as a failure meant that much of Palestine would have remained uninhabitable and the  Zionist would remained unfulfilled.[19] \nAfter working for a year as the director of the Hadassah Bacteriological Laboratory in Jerusalem, Kligler moved to Haifa and began his research into malaria, then the most  destructive disease in Palestine. His anti-malaria work is considered both nationally and internationally as his most important scientific work that resulted in a malaria-free Israel several years after his death./nFrom 1922 to 1925, Kligler published epidemiological studies on various infectious disease, working with   the renowned ophthalmologist Avraham Albert Ticho on Trachoma. He researched  Helminthic incidence in Jerusalem, Oriental Sore (leishmaniasis) and the characterization of Trypanosoma and Leishmania parasites grown on media./nIn the spheres of microbiology, epidemiology and public health, he emphasized  applied research, striving for continued improvement of the quality of life in the country. During his 24 years in Eretz Israel, Kligler published many articles on Microbiology (62 works), Parasitology (84) Virology (41) and Nutrition (6).  Kligler wrote for newspapers in Mandatory Palestine and abroad, lectured to audiences worldwide and regularly appeared on radio programs of Kol Yerushalayim (The Voice of Jerusalem), the new radio station in Palestine in the late 1930s./nMany researchers who worked with Kligler in his department became distinguished professors of science in institutions in the country and abroad. Students and colleagues included: \nProf. Gideon Mer (1894\u20131961) \u2013 a malariologist; \nProf. Aryeh Leo Olitzky (1898\u20131983)[20]\n[21]\n- a bacteriologist at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School; \nProf. Abraham Komarov (1907\u20131960) who became Director of the Government Veterinary Institute, Haifa and produced one of the most successful Foot-and-mouth disease vaccines;[22] \nProf. Meir Yoeli (1912\u20131975) \n[23] \n\u2013 a biologist who studied rodent malaria at the New York University Medical School,\n[24] and also wrote extensively on history of science including articles on malaria;[25][26][27]\nProf. Manfred Aschner (1901\u20131989) \u2013 a microbiologist and entomologist and was awarded the Israel Prize in 1956; \nProf. Yechiel Karl Guggenheim (1906\u20132002) \u2013 a nutritionist\n[28]\nand \nProf. Hans Bernkopf (1910\u20131966) \u2013 a virologist.\n[29]/nIn 1922 Kligler taught the first course in hygiene at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. The course was in Hebrew. Four of the five students in this first course joined him at the Anti-Malaria Research Institute that opened in September 1922 in Haifa, and worked as anti-malaria inspectors./nIn the early 1930s, Hebrew University began to offer courses in the natural sciences. During Kligler's tenure, more than forty students completed their studies in a master's degree and doctorate in natural sciences in the Department of Microbiology.[30]\nAmong his Ph.D. students were Benjamin Elazari Volcani (1915\u20131999) who was among the first to be awarded a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University and became a pioneer in the study of silicon compounds; Nathan Grossowicz (1914\u20132904) who became a professor in the Department of Microbiology of the university and worked on Legionnaires' disease;[31] \nDeborah Kaplan \u2013 an immunologist at The Chicago Medical School;\n[32]\nZvi Saliternik (1897\u20131993) who was awarded the Israel Prize in 1962 for his contribution to the control of malaria in the country;\n[33] \nProf. Shlomo Hestrin (1914\u20131962) who won the Israel Prize for Exact Science in 1957; \nHannah Farkas \u2013 a bacteriologist who was married to Ladislaus Farkas;[34][35]\nEmanuel Eylan (Oleinik) \u2013 a bacteriologist and David Nachtigal \u2013 a cellular immunologist at the Weizmann Institute, Rehovot./nAmong his graduate students were Natan Goldblum (1920\u20132001) a virologist who worked on polio research and other viral pathogenesis and was awarded the Israel Prize in 1988[36] \nand Aviva Zuckerman \u2013 a malaria researcher.\n[37]/nNathan Grossowicz described Kligler as/n\"original and interesting. He did not put a lot of importance in formal lectures and his teaching method was largely to require his students to read appropriate material including research articles followed by extensive class critical discussions and analysis with emphasis on experiment. Such that he stressed a hands on approach and instructed students to design their own experimental methods.\"[38]/nThe knowledge and experience he acquired before coming to Palestine, his organizational abilities, initiative and obvious talents in planning and carrying out projects turned Kligler into a respected and valued director and a member of many committees.  He insisted on personally overseeing every facet of his work, and everything had to be carried out according to his directions and specifications. In the Malaria Research Unit it was he who planned all the operational projects down to the smallest detail, and allocated the funding that was given to him. His administrative work was accompanied by research and experiments, the outcome of which significantly contributed to the eradication of the disease.  His managerial style and abrupt communication with people whose knowledge he did not appreciate did result in strong criticism, criticism he disregarded.  Throughout his career at the Hebrew University, the department he built became the most productive and the largest in the Life Sciences Institute. He excelled in obtaining funding for research. His fame and his connections helped him raise great sums of money, mainly from the US, which enabled him to recruit researchers and workers, to purchase the equipment for the laboratories and to finance research projects that kept piling up./nKligler was a key contributor to the eradication of malaria in Israel. Malaria was a major factor in morbidity and death in the country, and had important repercussions for Jewish settlement.  Before aliyah, Kligler gathered information about the health issues in the country and acquired experience in the field by joining a delegation for the Study of Yellow Fever in South America. Kligler prepared a malaria eradication program that was sent to several organizations and public figures, including Justice Louis Brandeis, who visited the country in 1919 and was shocked by the morbidity from malaria.  After failing to convince Chaim Weizmann and the Zionist executives of the need to invest in the eradication of malaria Brandeis privately financed $10,000 for an experimental project through Hadassah, which Kligler directed.[39] \nIn the Galilee and around Lake Kinnereth (Sea of Galilee), malaria had decimated the Jewish settlements, with the incidence rate running at more than 95 percent of the workers in 1919.  Kligler's report of 1921 showed that the incidence rate had been cut drastically, with many settlements reporting no cases at all./nBrandeis was impressed by the program writing:/n\"I have Kligler's Anti-Malaria Report for May\u2013June 1921 and think the results most satisfactory. Fundamental work - ably, conscientiously and economically done - by one who seems to be thinking only of his job and its relation to the great work at hand.\"/nHadassah and the Joint Distribution Committee continued to finance the anti-malaria work until 1926, with Kligler heading the project.  In 1922, Kligler founded and managed the Malaria Research Institute in Haifa, established by the Joint Distribution Committee Hadassah with Brandeis financial assistance and worked with the Department of Health under Mandatory Palestine. Studies at the Institute examined the feasibility of plans prepared by Kligler and evaluated methods appropriate for each region of the country. The unit collected data regarding the prevalence of the disease, types and breeding places of the mosquitoes and in parallel focused on education of the public in regard to controlling the disease./nKligler showed the ineffectiveness of previous methods used for the control of malaria in the country, namely, planting of Eucalyptus trees to dry the marshes, and the provision of Quinine prophylaxis for preventing infection. Kligler focused his studies on the larval stage of the mosquito life-cycle.  He studied the prevalence of various Anopheles species, their biology and nesting grounds, tested different methods of eradication and selected the appropriate measures taking into account their efficiency and cost.[40]/nHis work demonstrated that drainage of the swamps alone would have had little effect on the malaria, because the mosquitoes breed in little pools of water which even the most elaborate system of drainage would not have reached. It was subsequently pointed out that at least half of the malaria could be ascribed simply to human carelessness and neglect. This resulted in such an improvement to the quality of the land with respect to malaria and marshes that agriculture could be introduced safely.[41]/nOne of the new method he initiated was the introduction of Gambusia fish to water sources in the country in 1923. The use of larvivorous fish to diminish mosquito populations was already well known at that time, e.g.,[42] the importance lies in the protocols used to define which of the known species of Gambusia was best suited to the local conditions. The fish turned out to be an effective biological means against mosquito's larvae. The result was the almost total eradication of malaria in the upper Jordan Valley i.e. the Huleh area, north of the Sea of Galilee, [a] by using where appropriate combinations of anti-larval fish and drainage techniques./nThe achievements of Kligler and his staff in combating malaria were brought to the attention of the  Health Organization, an agency of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the World Health Organization, which in May 1925 sent a delegation to Mandatory Palestine. The delegation gave international recognition to the importance of anti-malarial activity conducted in the country.[44]\nKligler lectured on the war against malaria in Mandatory Palestine at the first international malaria conference held in Rome in October 1925; in the lecture he described the main effort is directed towards destruction of breeding places of mosquitoes.[45]/nIn 1927 he founded the \"Malaria Research Station\" of the Hebrew University in Rosh Pina, where pioneering field work was carried out relating to the eradication of malaria. Two years later he appointed Dr. Gideon Mer as the station manager and together they published a series of articles on malaria.[46]/nTouching and genuine is the cartoon which describes Kligler, naively, as the great malaria eradicator and the courageous researcher./nIn 1922, the 12th Zionist Congress created the Va'ad ha-Briut (Health Council) as part of the Va'ad Leumi, the Jewish National Council and the executive authority of the Jews in Palestine. In 1926 Kligler was asked by the Va'ad ha-Briut to approve any new settlement from the point of view of malaria risk. He crisscrossed the length and breadth of Palestine many times checking the suitability of new land for settlement. The original Kibbutz Amir, the last of the tower and stockade settlements, was first built on the edge of the Hula swamp, in opposition to Kligler's advice, and as such all members of the kibbutz had malaria. Eventually after three years in 1942 it was moved to its present location./nProfessor Nocht, President of the League of Nations Commission, while in Palestine, concluded after Dr Kligler's report the following:/n\"... It was not the custom of the commission to make comparisons but we would on this occasion, say that the interest Palestine had provided was unsurpassed by that of any of their other visits, ... the Commission would greatly profit by its visit to Palestine, and the world would surely benefit by what they have seen there, through the medium of the League of Nations\".[47][48]/nDr Kligler's efforts to eliminate malaria in Palestine came notwithstanding the pessimism of \"... the experts of 1918 ... (who prophesied) that the future of this country (Palestine) might be considered to be almost hopeless from the malarial standpoint...\"[49]/nKligler also worked extensively in matters connected with public health. He joined the Health Advisory Board established in 1922 by the 12th Zionist Congress and in 1933 he was elected to replace Henrietta Szold as chairman of the Zionist Organization health committee.[50] He collaborated with Avraham Katznelson, who ran the Department of Health, together they coordinated the exchanges between various medical institutions, including Hadassah health care, Clalit Health Services and other organizations./nKligler was an active member in associations that promoted physical activity, such as the Association for Playgrounds in Israel[51] and the Association for Public Swimming Pools[52] established in the 1930s. At the annual meeting of physical education teachers, he spoke about the importance of physical exercise./nKligler was among the founders of the Anti-Tuberculosis League, a national body established in 1925 after several failed attempts,[53] and served as its first chairman. He was also a member of the Advisory Committee of the Palestinian society for the Deaf,  established in the mid-1930s./nKligler organized the first national conference of microbiologists in Mandatory Palestine, held in Jerusalem in 1936, and was elected president of Palestinian Microbiology Association. He was chairman of the meetings held between the years 1936\u20131942./nFrom its establishment in 1929,  Kligler ran the Nathan and Lina Straus Health Center in Jerusalem (now part of Hadassah Medical Center), which gained a strong reputation for its public health programs during the ten years under his guidance./nKligler hosted and served as a guide for many distinguished international visitors, among them Commander Bernard Montgomery, Rabbi Stephen Wise and the American ambassador in Russia, William Christian Bullitt./nHe regularly attended meetings of the  General Agricultural Council of Israel; and chaired the Nutrition Committee as a representative of the Hebrew University and later the Jewish Agency. He was active in programs to promote the local olive oil industry and treat livestock diseases./nIn 1930, he organized the first survey of nutrition in the country. The survey findings  led to the founding of a Nutrition Committee headed by Kligler. Kligler enthusiastically supported a plan of Dr. Katznelson of the Va'ad Leumi to provide a daily glass of milk to schoolchildren, which would not only improve nutrition but would also help dairy farmers.  The campaign began in May 1938 in Jerusalem and shortly after was extended to  other cities.[55]/nWhen the public health organisation suffered from financial problems in 1937, Kligler secured financial aid.[56] As World War II approached, he was appointed to a committee to investigate community preparedness and handle emergencies when the war broke out. At the beginning of 1941 he was asked by the American-Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) to organize medical aid for Jewish refugees from Europe who arrived in the Dominican Republic at Sosua.[57] Sosua was the site of a Jewish Refugee settlement created by and large by the JDC as the Dominican Republic Settlement Association (DORSA).[58] In December 1942 Jacob Kligler and his wife Helen spent three weeks on a medical inspection of Sosua. They jointly made reports on their recommendations on malaria control and primary medical care.[b]/nIn 1942, the Polish government-in-exile in London had asked Kligler to prepare a typhus vaccine to save thousands of refugees in Eastern Europe. In the words of the Polish consul,/n\"Professor Kligler did not hesitate to help them. Together with a number of his devoted assistants, he began this work with enthusiasm. Knowing well the danger, he and his assistants tried the vaccine on themselves.  They all contracted the disease, and it needed the competence of his eminent colleagues to save Professor Kligler's life. The President of Poland greatly appreciated Professors Kligler's humanitarian, unselfish work, and his sacrifice for the sake of suffering Polish citizens, and in order to acknowledge this, confers upon Professor Israel Kligler the Golden Cross of Merit.\"[c]/nThree years later he was sent by the Joint Distribution Committee to organize medical aid for the arrival of 1,600 Yemeni-Jewish refugees in Aden.[61]/nHe died a few months after his return to Mandatory Palestine.[62]/nKligler's political views lay with the Brit Shalom, an organization espousing a binational solution for promoting the co-existence of Jews and Arabs in the State of Israel, views shared by his close friends Judah Magnes and Henrietta Szold.[63]/nAlthough there were many proposals to commemorate Kligler after his death, such as building a clinic in his name, publishing a book in his memory or the establishment of a fund for students in his name but as a result of the tumultuous events experienced by the community in the 1940s, little was realized and less survived over time./nSome blame it though on issues between Kligler and other members of the local academia. As of 2012, The Times of Israel newspaper concluded that only \"two Kligler loyalists are waging a lonely battle to restore him to what they see as his rightful place in the history of Israel and of the fight against malaria.\" These are named as the retired Israeli scientist Zalman Greenberg, former director of the Health Ministry's Public Health Laboratory in Jerusalem, and the retired London lawyer Anton Alexander. The former is an experienced researcher and author on the topic of medical history in Mandate Palestine and Israel, while the latter has been very active outside Israel and has set up a website highlighting Kligler's achievements. Greenberg goes as far as to doubt that there would have been a State of Israel without Kligler's contribution at eradicating malaria.[64]/nKligler's grave, along with others, including that of Henrietta Szold were desecrated after the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war (1948), when the entire cemetery on the Mount of Olives was under Jordanian jurisdiction and a road was paved over it. After the Six-Day War (1967) the area fell under Israeli jurisdiction, the road was removed and a mass grave was created.[65] Among the names listed on the memorial stone is the name of Israel Jacob Kligler.[66]", "1437618": "Sir Almroth Edward Wright KBE CB FRCSI FRS (10 August 1861 \u2013 30 April 1947) was a British bacteriologist and immunologist.[2]/nHe is notable for developing a system of anti-typhoid fever inoculation, recognizing early on that antibiotics would create resistant bacteria, and being a strong advocate for preventive medicine./nWright was born at Middleton Tyas, near Richmond, North Yorkshire into a family of mixed Anglo-Irish and Swedish descent.[3] He was the son of Reverend Charles Henry Hamilton Wright, deacon of Middleton Tyas, who later served in Belfast, Dublin, and Liverpool and managed the Protestant Reformation Society.[4] His mother, Ebba Almroth, was the daughter of Nils Wilhelm Almroth\u00a0[sv], Governor of the Swedish Royal Mint in Stockholm.[5] His younger brother Charles Theodore Hagberg Wright became the librarian of the London Library./nIn 1882, he graduated from Trinity College Dublin with first-class honours in modern literature and won a gold medal in modern languages and literature.[6]:\u200a2\u200a Simultaneously he took medicine courses and in 1883 graduated in medicine.[1][6]:\u200a3\u200a In the late 19th century, Wright worked with the armed forces of Britain to develop vaccines and promote immunisation./nHe married Jane Georgina Wilson (1861-1926) [3] in 1889 and had three children. The first, Edward Robert Mackay Wright (1890-1913), was born in Glebe, Sydney. Second son Leonard Almoth Wilson Wright (1891-1972) was born in Dublin, as was daughter Doris Helena MacNaughton Wright (later Romanes, after whom the Helena Romanes School was named) (1894-1990).[7]/nIn 1902, Wright started a research department at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London.  He developed a system of anti-typhoid fever inoculation and brought the humoral and cellular theories of immunity together by showing the cooperation of a substance (that he named opsonin) contained in the serum with the phagocytes against pathogens.[8] Citing the example of the Second Boer War, during which many soldiers died from easily preventable diseases, Wright convinced the armed forces that 10 million vaccine doses for the troops in northern France should be produced during World War I. During WWI Wright established a research laboratory attached to the British Expeditionary Force's hospital designated Number 13, General Hospital in Boulogne-sur-Mer.[9] In 1919 Wright returned to St Mary's and remained there until his retirement in 1946. Among the many bacteriologists who followed in Wright's footsteps at St Mary's was Sir Alexander Fleming, who in turn later discovered lysozyme and penicillin. Wright was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1906.[10] Leonard Colebrook became his assistant in 1907 and continued working with him until 1929.[11]/nWright warned early on that antibiotics would create resistant bacteria,[6]:\u200a130\u200a something that has proven an increasing danger. He made his thoughts on preventive medicine influential, stressing preventive measures. Wright's ideas have been re-asserted recently\u201470 years after his death\u2014by modern researchers in articles in such periodicals as Scientific American. He also argued that microorganisms are vehicles of disease but not its cause, a theory that earned him the nickname \"Almroth Wrong\" from his opponents. Another derogatory nickname was \"Sir Almost Wright\".[12]/nHe also proposed that logic be introduced as a part of medical training, but his idea was never adopted. Wright also pointed out that Pasteur and Fleming, although both excellent researchers, had not actually managed to find cures for the diseases for which they had sought cures, but instead had stumbled upon cures for totally unrelated diseases.[citation needed]/nWright was a strong proponent of the Ptomaine theory for the cause of Scurvy.[13] The theory was that poorly preserved meats contained alkaloids that were poisonous to humans when consumed. This theory was prevalent when Robert Falcon Scott planned his fateful expedition to the Antarctic in 1911. In 1932, the true cause of the disease was determined to be the deficiency from the diet of a particular nutrient, now called Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid, Scorbic meaning Scurvy).[citation needed]/nThere is a ward named after him at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London.[citation needed]/nWright was strongly opposed to women's suffrage. He argued that women's brains were innately different from men's and were not constituted to deal with social and public issues. His arguments were most fully expounded in his book The Unexpurgated Case Against Woman Suffrage (1913). In the book, Wright also vigorously opposes the professional development of women.[14] Rebecca West and May Sinclair both wrote articles criticizing Wright's opposition to women's suffrage.[15][16] Charlotte Perkins Gilman satirized Wright's opposition to women's suffrage in her novel Herland.[14]/nWright was a friend of his fellow-Irishman George Bernard Shaw. He was immortalised as Sir Colenso Ridgeon in the play The Doctor's Dilemma written in 1906, which arose from conversations between Shaw and Wright. Shaw credits Wright as the source of his information on medical science: \"It will be evident to all experts that my play could not have been written but for the work done by Sir Almroth Wright on the theory and practice of securing immunization from bacterial diseases by the inoculation of vaccines made of their own bacteria.\"[17] This remark of Shaw's is characteristically ironical.  Wright was knighted shortly before the play was written, and Shaw was suspicious of Wright's high reputation (the latter was also known by the nickname Sir Almost Right). The two men met in 1905, and engaged in a long series of robust discussions, involving at one point a challenge from the medical audience that they had \"too many patients on our hands already\". Shaw's response was to ask what would be done if there was more demand from patients than could be satisfied, and Wright answered: \"We should have to consider which life was worth saving.\" This became the \"dilemma\" of the play.[18]/nShaw also portrays him in his playlet How These Doctors Love One Another! and uses his theory of bacterial mutation in Too True to Be Good.[12] Shaw, who campaigned for women's suffrage, strongly disagreed with Wright about women's brains and dismissed his views on the subject as absurd.[citation needed]/nWright had been honoured for his deeds a total of 29 times in his lifetime \u2013 a knighthood, 5 honorary doctorates, 5 honorary orders, 6 fellowships (2 honoraries), 4 prizes, 4 memberships, and 3 medals (Buchanan Medal, Fothergill Gold Medal and a special medal \"for the best medical work in connection with the war\").[19]:\u200a282\u200a He was nominated 14 times for the Nobel prize from 1906 to 1925.[20]/nWright's work could be split up into the following three phases", "1568691": "Robert G.

Without formal education, she made a name for herself in botany, ornithology and entomology. She was also an accomplished poet and painter, and illustrated her scientific contributions that were published by learned societies such as the Royal Entomological Society in London, the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, and the Linnean Society of London./nBarber was born Mary Elizabeth Bowker in South Newton, Wiltshire, on 5 January 1818. She was the ninth of eleven[2] children and first daughter[3] of Miles and Anna Maria Bowker of Gateshead, Northumberland.[4] Her father was a moderately wealthy sheep farmer, owning his own wool-processing business.[4] In 1820 he moved his family to Cape Colony, South Africa along with other British settlers who wished to take advantage of the South African government's offer of 100 acres of land for every man over the age of 18. The Bowker family received land in Albany, near Grahamstown.[3] Here Bowker set up a school for his children and those of this workers, and his affinity for natural history heavily influenced the lessons the children received.[3][4]/nMary and her brothers all shared a love of natural history, but it was the 1838 publication of the book The genera of South African plants, arranged according to the Natural System by Irish botanist William Henry Harvey[5] that changed her life. She was fascinated by the chapters on the structure of plants and the Linnean classification system, and responded to the author's request for specimens so that he could begin documenting the flora of the Cape.[3] Her ongoing correspondence with Harvey took place during a time when it was not generally accepted for women to engage in scientific discussion;[4] indeed, in the beginning she did not disclose the fact that she was a woman.[3] She enjoyed unprecedented freedom in this respect, partly because she was released from the relatively constraining Victorian culture of her home country, but also because of her father's encouragement and the generally relaxed pre-Victorian (Georgian) ideals he carried from an era when women enjoyed a freer voice.[4] She became one of Harvey's main suppliers of plants from South Africa and also assisted him in the naming and classification of numerous species.[6] Over a nearly 30-year correspondence, she sent Harvey approximately 1,000 species with notes on each one.[3] She also established a correspondence with British botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker.[6]/nIn 1842 she married Frederick William Barber, an analytical chemist who had established a farm in South Africa.[3] They had two sons and a daughter.[2] Barber was the grandmother of the sculptor, Ivan Mitford-Barberton/nBarber made substantial contributions to botanical science of the era through her collections and scientific observations of South African flora and fauna. This resulted in several plant species being named after her.[7] She and her younger brother, naturalist James Henry Bowker, sent many previously unknown species of plants to the herbarium at Trinity College Dublin, and the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew.[4][8]/nAloidendron barberae (tree aloe) was first discovered by Barber, who was collecting plants in the former Transkei of South Africa. She sent specimens of the plant and its flowers to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, where in 1874 the specific epithet was given by William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (1843\u20131928) in her honor. In addition, she discovered Lotononis harveyi (Mrs. Barber's beauty), which was named after her.[9]/nBarber developed an interest in entomology while her husband was engaged in the ongoing guerilla warfare between the settlers and native Africans. With her brother, James Henry Bowker, she began documenting African moths and butterflies, and contacted entomologist Roland Trimen (1840\u20131916) in 1863 to share her discoveries.[3] Her observations are reported to have contributed to Charles Darwin's deliberations on the role of moths in orchid pollination.[4] Barber was introduced to Charles Darwin by Roland Trimen, a fellow British entomologist in South Africa in 1863. Barber exchanged letters and observations with Darwin and other gentlemen-naturalists in his scientific network.[10]:\u200aLetter 5745\u200a Her influence on Darwin's work was communicated indirectly, via Trimen. In 1865, Mary had declared she would write to Darwin herself about \"the locusts and the locust birds\", but there is no record of this, despite Darwin himself being a meticulous archiver of his correspondence.[4] In other letters, Barber seemed to concur with Darwin's theory of natural selection, citing the dominance of European settlers in Cape Colony as proof.[11]/nBarber's contributions to science were eventually rewarded in 1878 with an invitation to become a member of the South African Philosophical Society \u2013 a singular honour at the time. The Linnean Society in London did not welcome women as members until 1905, emphasizing the progressive nature of this South African society, and the impact that Barber had had on her discipline. Her reply to this invitation sums up the attitudes of the time:/n\"I have no objection....and I don't see any reason why a Lady should in a quiet way be a member of any scientific society... I do not by any means approve of ladies coming publicly forward and usurping the places of men by preaching, making speeches, etc., but I don't see why they should not belong to any society that they are qualified for, and in a quiet way enjoy the privileges too.\" [4]/nBarber joined the South African Philosophical Society on 26 June 1878. Her paper on the peculiar colours of animals in relation to their habits of life was published later that year.[12] This paper was written in response to an article by Alfred Russel Wallace in which he debated Darwin's theory on female choice in sexual selection.[13] Barber fully appreciated (and had the observations to prove) that females choose males based on their phenotypes: showy courtships, glossy plumage.[12]/nShe went on to become the first female member of the Ornithologischer Verein in Vienna, the main ornithological society in Austria,[4] and several papers of hers were translated into Hungarian.[4]/nIn the 1850s Barber assisted her older brother, Thomas Holden Bowker, in his work amassing the first collection of Stone Age implements in South Africa.[3]:\u200a10\u200a[14] In the 1870s Barber wrote a collection of articles about the discovery of diamonds and gold in South Africa.

The back yard of the office was home to many herbs that William grew there including nettles, hops, raspberries, spilanthes, comfrey, holy basel and catnip./nIn 1993 he entered acupuncture school, but never graduated, being one course shy of the requirements. He continued to live in New York, and also spent time in a vacation home in the Blue Ridge Mountains which was also a school and nature preserve. He also visited Italy several times. He died in 2003 from complications of cirrhosis of the liver.[4]/nOne hallmark of most serious herbalism is the use of herbs in a formula.  LeSassier had been exposed to Chinese medicine where the standards were \"one disease, many formulas\" and individualizing formulas to the strengths and weaknesses of the patient. Herbs in the Chinese system are recognized by their effects on specific organs and meridians or organ systems.  A Chinese formulation generally has a \"king\" herb that addresses the major problem, supported by \"ministers\" that either support it or address weak organ systems, and \"servant\" herbs that harmonize and carry the herbal effects to specific parts of the body. However, a system that bridged the various Western and Eastern herbal traditions was lacking./nThe Triune System of Formulation was inspired by a vision LeSassier had during a period of personal difficulty \u2014 a vision that changed the direction of his herbal practice. He saw a triangle, and saw Pythagoras giving him a book./nThe system consisted of one triangle inverted within a larger triangle, with the client\u2019s constitution or core condition in the center and supporting organ systems in the flanking sides. According to the system, nine herbs would be used: three in larger amounts to support the core problem, with lower amounts for the supporting systems./nHerbs in the system are classified by their ability to either build or tonify (+), react amphoterically (which means to stabilize or harmonize) (0), or to eliminate (-). Herbs on the apex of each triangle represented the \"king\", the ruler/significant herb/neutral signified by a circle. A \"minister\", the herb that communicates to other plants and takes the message to the king, is signified by a plus sign. A \"servant\", the reciprocal part of the formula that acts upon/eliminates through the \"doorways of the body\".  Measurement of herb was formulated by energetic strength, not weight, with the most potent herbs being used less than the milder ones.[1][4]/nIn the 1960s, LeSassier married in Taos, and had a daughter, Ona Marie LeSassier. He later remarried in New York and had a son, Alex LeSassier in 1986. In 1989 he met his partner Daniela Noe, with whom he lived for the rest of his life.", "1568873": "James Edward Rothman (born November 3, 1950) is an American biochemist. He is the Fergus F.

He had been awarded the Frank Smart studentship in botany and, after graduation, went to study the subject in Germany under Wilhelm Pfeffer.[3]/nIn 1894, Keeble spent time in Ceylon researching plant physiology. He was interested in the hanging foliage of a number of tropical trees; specifically Amherstia, Brownea, and Humboldtia. This study produced his first publications which consisted of two academic papers published in 1895.[2] Having returned to the UK, he was an assistant lecturer in botany at Owens College, Victoria University in Manchester[3] and also taught at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (covering sabbatical leave of Professor John Henry Salter in 1896).[4]/nIn 1902 he joined University College, Reading, first as a lecturer in botany, and from October that year as director of its horticultural department.[5] He was promoted to professor in 1907 and served as Dean of the Faculty of Science between 1907 and 1909.[1] During his time at Reading, he collaborated on publications with F. W. Gamble and E. F. Armstrong.[1][2] In 1910, he was involved in a delegation from Reading to various universities in Canada and the United States of America. Their purpose was to investigate new methods of agricultural education and research.[6]/nIn 1914, he left Reading to take up the appointment of Director of the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens in Wisley, Surrey.[1] He had been recommended to the Council of the Royal Horticultural Society by Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour, a former Regius Professor of Botany.[3]/nWhen the United Kingdom joined World War I in August 1914, Keeble left the recently acquired position at RHS Garden, Wisley, to join the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.[1] In 1917, the Food Production Department was created. He transferred to the new department as Controller of Horticulture.[2] That year, he wrote an article for The Times that advised on the growing of potatoes at home as part of the campaign for increased agricultural output.[7] In a letter to the same newspaper, he drew attention to a newly created units of 'patriotic gardeners', formed by the Royal Horticultural Society. These experiences gardeners were to travel the country, advising allotments, schools and other organisations about food production.[8]/nIn 1919, he was promoted to Assistant Secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.[3] During this post, he was instrumental in the establishment of the East Malling Research Station as an independent but government-funded horticultural research centre.[1] The station was previously part of Wye College, an educational institution specialising in agriculture.[2] He gave two lectures at the Royal Institution in 1919, concerning intensive cultivation.[9]/nIn 1920, Keeble left the civil service and returned to academia.[3] He had been elected to the appointment of Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford in December 1919.

In 1933, he earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Toronto.  He spent the next decade in the University of California system, first as a postdoctoral fellow at UC Berkeley, then as Instructor and assistant professor at UC Davis.  At Davis, he helped determine the relationships among the B complex vitamins through experiments on chickens.  He then left academia to work for American Cyanamid's Lederle Laboratories, where he helped established that folic acid is a vitamin and discovered that feeding livestock a continual supply of antibiotics significantly enhances growth (a practice that has become widespread in the meat industry).[2]/nFollowing the rise of molecular biology, Jukes returned to UC Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his career.[2]  Independently of Motoo Kimura, Jukes (with Jack King) proposed in 1969 that the evolution of proteins is primarily driven by genetic drift acting on mutations that are neither beneficial nor deleterious\u2014the neutral theory of molecular evolution.  Despite the provocative paper (\"Non-Darwinian Evolution\"),[3] he was not a prominent participant in the ensuing \"neutralist-selectionist debate\"; defense of the neutral theory was primarily left to others, especially Kimura.  In 1971, Jukes was one of the founders of the Journal of Molecular Evolution; his subsequent work with molecular evolution focused especially on the origin and evolution of the genetic code.[4]/nAfter returning to Berkeley, he also became heavily involved in a number of public scientific controversies, and was a gifted polemicist.  In the 1960s, he fought against the introduction of creationism into the California public schools.  Following the rise of the environmental movement, he fought against DDT bans, citing lack of evidence for detrimental effects to ecosystems.  Between 1975 and 1980 he was one of the only scientists ever to have a regular column in the journal Nature, which he used to denounce a variety of what he considered pseudoscience, expressing \"his deep suspicion that categorical statements of scientific 'fact' are usually exaggerations.\"  He was one of the most prominent critics of Linus Pauling's claims about the benefits of vitamin C megadosage, and a frequent critic of other nutrition-based health and treatment claims, such as for homeopathy and the supposed cancer cure Laetrile.[5][6]/nThomas Jukes died of pneumonia on November 1, 1999.

Based on the 1938 John W. Campbell Jr. novella Who Goes There?, it tells the story of a group of American researchers in Antarctica who encounter the eponymous \"Thing\", an extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates, other organisms. The group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each other and that any of them could be the Thing. The film stars Kurt Russell as the team's helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady, with A. Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas G. Waites in supporting roles./nProduction began in the mid-1970s as a faithful adaptation of the novella, following 1951's The Thing from Another World. The Thing went through several directors and writers, each with different ideas on how to approach the story. Filming lasted roughly twelve weeks, beginning in August 1981, and took place on refrigerated sets in Los Angeles as well as in Juneau, Alaska, and Stewart, British Columbia. Of the film's $15\u00a0million budget, $1.5\u00a0million was spent on Rob Bottin's creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form./nThe Thing was released in 1982 to negative reviews that described it as \"instant junk\" and \"a wretched excess\". Critics both praised the special effects achievements and criticized their visual repulsiveness, while others found the characterization poorly realized. The film grossed $19.6\u00a0million during its theatrical run. Many reasons have been cited for its failure to impress audiences: competition from films such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which offered an optimistic take on alien visitation; a summer that had been filled with successful science fiction and fantasy films; and an audience living through a recession, diametrically opposed to The Thing's nihilistic and bleak tone./nThe film found an audience when released on home video and television. In the subsequent years, it has been reappraised as one of the best science fiction and horror films ever made and has gained a cult following. Filmmakers have noted its influence on their work, and it has been referred to in other media such as television and video games. The Thing has spawned a variety of merchandise\u00a0\u2013 including a 1982 novelization, \"haunted house\" attractions, board games\u00a0\u2013 and sequels in comic books, a video game of the same title, and a 2011 prequel film of the same title./nIn Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a sled dog to an American research station. The Americans witness the passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The pilot fires a rifle and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burnt corpse of a malformed humanoid, which they transfer to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, autopsies the remains and finds a normal set of human organs./nClark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs several of the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team, and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the Dog-Thing and surmises it is an organism that can perfectly imitate other life-forms. Data recovered from the Norwegian base leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, which Norris estimates has been buried for over a hundred thousand years, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Blair grows paranoid after running a computer simulation that indicates the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The group implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation./nThe remains of the malformed humanoid assimilate an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. The team also imprisons Blair in a tool shed after he sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. Copper suggests testing for infection by comparing the crew's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry's leadership, and MacReady takes command. He, Windows, and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. During their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack./nThe team debates whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack. As Copper attempts to defibrillate Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head detaches and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life-form with its own survival instinct. He proposes testing blood samples from each survivor with a heated piece of wire and has each man restrained, but is forced to kill Clark after he lunges at MacReady with a scalpel. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood recoils from the heat. Exposed, the Palmer-Thing transforms, breaks free of its bonds, and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to incinerate them both./nChilds is left on guard while the others go to test Blair, but they find that he has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small flying saucer, which they destroy. Upon their return, Childs is missing, and the power generator is destroyed, leaving the men without heat. MacReady speculates that, with no escape left, the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls agree that the Thing cannot be allowed to escape and set explosives to destroy the station, but the Blair-Thing kills Garry, and Nauls disappears. The Blair-Thing transforms into an enormous creature and breaks the detonator, but MacReady triggers the explosives with a stick of dynamite, destroying the station./nWhile MacReady sits by the burning remnants, Childs returns, claiming he got lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted and slowly freezing to death, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share a bottle of Scotch whisky./nThe Thing also features Norbert Weisser as one of the Norwegians,[9] and an uncredited dog, Jed, as the Dog-Thing.[10] The only female presence in the film is the voice of MacReady's chess computer, voiced by Carpenter's then-wife, Adrienne Barbeau.[11][12] Producer David Foster, associate producer Larry Franco, and writer Bill Lancaster, along with other members of the crew, make a cameo appearance in a recovered photograph of the Norwegian team.[13] Camera operator Ray Stella stood in for the shots where needles were used to take blood, telling Carpenter that he could do it all day. Franco also played the Norwegian wielding a rifle and hanging out of the helicopter during the opening sequence.[14][9] Stunt Coordinator Dick Warlock also made a number of cameos in the film, most notably in an off-screen appearance as the shadow on the wall during the scene where the Dog-Thing enters one of the researcher's living quarters.[15] Clennon was originally intended to be in the scene, but due to his shadow being easily identifiable Carpenter decided to use Warlock instead.[16] Warlock also played Palmer-Thing and stood in for Brimley in a few scenes that involved Blair.[17]/nDevelopment of the film began in the mid-1970s when David Foster and fellow producer Lawrence Turman suggested to Universal Pictures an adaptation of the 1938 John W. Campbell novella Who Goes There?. It had been loosely adapted once before in Howard Hawks's and Christian Nyby's 1951 film The Thing from Another World, but Foster and Turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to the source material. Screenwriters Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins held the rights to make an adaptation, but passed on the opportunity to make a new film, so Universal obtained the rights from them.[11][18] In 1976, Wilbur Stark had purchased the remake rights to 23 RKO Pictures films, including The Thing from Another World, from three Wall Street financiers who did not know what to do with them, in exchange for a return when the films were produced.[19] Universal in turn acquired the rights to remake the film from Stark, resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements, posters, television commercials, and studio press material.[20]/nJohn Carpenter was first approached about the project in 1976 by co-producer and friend Stuart Cohen,[21] but Carpenter was mainly an independent film director, so Universal chose The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) director Tobe Hooper as they already had him under contract. The producers were ultimately unhappy with Hooper and his writing partner Kim Henkel's concept. After several more failed pitches by different writers, and attempts to bring on other directors, such as John Landis, the project was put on hold. Even so, the success of Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction horror film Alien helped revitalize the project, at which point Carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential slasher film Halloween (1978).[11][22]/nCarpenter was reluctant to join the project, for he thought Hawks's adaptation would be difficult to surpass, although he considered the film's monster to be unnotable. Cohen suggested that he read the original novella. Carpenter found the \"creepiness\" of the imitations conducted by the creature, and the questions it raised, interesting. He drew parallels between the novella and Agatha Christie's mystery novel And Then There Were None (1939), and noted that the story of Who Goes There? was \"timely\" for him, meaning he could make it \"true to [his] day\" as Hawks had in his time.[23] Carpenter, a fan of Hawks's adaptation, paid homage to it in Halloween, and he watched The Thing from Another World several times for inspiration before filming began.[24][25] Carpenter and cinematographer Dean Cundey first worked together on Halloween, and The Thing was their first big-budget project for a major film studio.[25]/nAfter securing the writer and crew, the film was stalled again when Carpenter nearly quit, believing that a passion project of his, El Diablo (1990), was on the verge of being made by EMI Films. The producers discussed various replacements including Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah and Michael Ritchie, but the development of El Diablo was not as imminent as Carpenter believed, and he remained with The Thing.[11]/nUniversal initially set a budget of $10\u00a0million, with $200,000 for \"creature effects\", which at the time was more than the studio had ever allocated to a monster film. Filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days. Universal's production studios estimated that it would require at least $17\u00a0million before marketing and other costs, as the plan involved more set construction, including external sets and a large set piece for the original scripted death of Bennings, which was estimated to cost $1.5\u00a0million alone. As storyboarding and designs were finalized, the crew estimated they would need at least $750,000 for creature effects, a figure Universal executives agreed to after seeing the number of workers employed under Rob Bottin, the special make-up effects designer. Larry Franco was responsible for making the budget work for the film; he cut the filming schedule by a third, eliminated the exterior sets for on-site shooting, and removed Bennings's more extravagant death scene. Cohen suggested reusing the destroyed American camp as the ruined Norwegian camp, saving a further $250,000. When filming began in August, The Thing had a budget of $11.4\u00a0million, and indirect costs brought it to $14\u00a0million.[26] The effects budget ran over, eventually totaling $1.5\u00a0million, forcing the elimination of some scenes, including Nauls's confrontation of a creature dubbed the \"box Thing\".[26][12] By the end of production, Carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive Ned Tanen for $100,000 to complete a simplified version of the Blair-Thing.[26] The final cost was $12.4\u00a0million, and overhead costs brought it to $15\u00a0million.[26][12][b]/nSeveral writers developed drafts for The Thing before Carpenter became involved, including Logan's Run (1967) writer William F. Nolan, novelist David Wiltse, and Hooper and Henkel, whose draft was set at least partially underwater, and which Cohen described as a Moby-Dick-like story in which \"The Captain\" did battle with a large, non-shapeshifting creature.[11] As Carpenter said in a 2014 interview, \"they were just trying to make it work\".[27] The writers left before Carpenter joined the project.[27][28][29] He said the scripts were \"awful\", as they changed the story into something it was not, and ignored the chameleon-like aspect of the Thing.[21] Carpenter did not want to write the project himself, after recently completing work on Escape from New York (1981), and having struggled to complete a screenplay for The Philadelphia Experiment (1984). He was wary of taking on writing duties, preferring to let someone else do it.[23] Once Carpenter was confirmed as the director, several writers were asked to script The Thing, including Richard Matheson, Nigel Kneale, and Deric Washburn.[11]/nBill Lancaster initially met with Turman, Foster and Cohen in 1977, but he was given the impression that they wanted to closely replicate The Thing from Another World, and he did not want to remake the film.[30] In August 1979, Lancaster was contacted again. By this time he had read the original Who Goes There? novella, and Carpenter had become involved in the project.[30] Lancaster was hired to write the script after describing his vision for the film, and his intention to stick closely to the original story, to Carpenter, who was a fan of Lancaster's work on The Bad News Bears (1976).[23][30][29] Lancaster conceived several key scenes in the film, including the Norris-Thing biting Dr. Copper, and the use of blood tests to identify the Thing, which Carpenter cited as the reason he wanted to work on the film.[23] Lancaster said he found some difficulty in translating Who Goes There? to film, as it features very little action. He also made some significant changes to the story, such as reducing the number of characters from 37 to 12. Lancaster said that 37 was excessive and would be difficult for audiences to follow, leaving little screen time for characterization. He also opted to alter the story's structure, choosing to open his in the middle of the action, instead of using a flashback as in the novella.[30] Several characters were modernized for contemporary audiences; MacReady, originally a meteorologist, became a tough loner described in the script as \"35. Helicopter pilot. Likes chess. Hates the cold. The pay is good.\" Lancaster aimed to create an ensemble piece where one person emerged as the hero, instead of having a Doc Savage-type hero from the start.[31]/nLancaster wrote thirty to forty pages but struggled with the film's second act, and it took him several months to complete the script.[23][30] After it was finished, Lancaster and Carpenter spent a weekend in northern California refining the script, each having different takes on how a character should sound, and comparing their ideas for scenes. Lancaster's script opted to keep the creature largely concealed throughout the film, and it was Bottin who convinced Carpenter to make it more visible to have a greater impact on the audience.[23][32] Lancaster's original ending had both MacReady and Childs turn into the Thing. In the spring, the characters are rescued by helicopter, greeting their saviors with \"Hey, which way to a hot meal?\". Carpenter thought this ending was too shallow. In total, Lancaster completed four drafts of the screenplay. The novella concludes with the humans clearly victorious, but concerned that birds they see flying toward the mainland may have been infected by the Thing. Carpenter opted to end the film with the survivors slowly freezing to death to save humanity from infection, believing this to be the ultimate heroic act.[23][33] Lancaster wrote this ending, which eschews a The Twilight Zone-style twist or the destruction of the monster, as he wanted to instead have an ambiguous moment between the pair, of trust and mistrust, fear and relief.[34]/nKurt Russell was involved in the production before being cast, helping Carpenter develop his ideas.[36] Russell was the last actor to be cast, in June 1981, by which point second unit filming was starting in Juneau, Alaska.[36][37] Carpenter had worked with Russell twice before but wanted to keep his options open. Discussions with the studio involved using actors Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges, or Nick Nolte, who were either unavailable or declined, and Sam Shepard, who showed interest but was never pursued. Tom Atkins and Jack Thompson were strong early and late contenders for the role of MacReady, but the decision was made to go with Russell.[37] In part, Carpenter cited the practicality of choosing someone he had found reliable before, and who would not balk at the difficult filming conditions.[38] It took Russell about a year to grow his hair and beard out for the role.[14] At various points, the producers met with Brian Dennehy, Kris Kristofferson, John Heard, Ed Harris, Tom Berenger, Jack Thompson, Scott Glenn, Fred Ward, Peter Coyote, Tom Atkins, and Tim McIntire. Some passed on the idea of starring in a monster film, while Dennehy became the choice to play Copper.[37] Each actor was to be paid $50,000, but after the more-established Russell was cast, his salary increased to $400,000.[26]/nGeoffrey Holder, Carl Weathers, and Bernie Casey were considered for the role of Childs, and Carpenter also looked at Isaac Hayes, having worked with him on Escape from New York. Ernie Hudson was the front-runner and was almost cast until they met with Keith David.[39] The Thing was David's first significant film role, and coming from a theater background, he had to learn on set how to hold himself back and not show every emotion his character was feeling, with guidance from Richard Masur and Donald Moffat in particular. Masur and David discussed their characters in rehearsals and decided that they would not like each other.[40] For Blair, the team chose the then-unknown Wilford Brimley, as they wanted an everyman whose absence would not be questioned by the audience until the appropriate time. The intent with the character was to have him become infected early in the film but offscreen, so that his status would be unknown to the audience, concealing his intentions. Carpenter wanted to cast Donald Pleasence, but it was decided that he was too recognizable to accommodate the role.[35] T. K. Carter was cast as Nauls, but comedian Franklyn Ajaye also came in to read for the role. Instead, he delivered a lengthy speech about the character being a stereotype, after which the meeting ended.[41]/nBottin lobbied hard to play Palmer, but it was deemed impossible for him to do so alongside his existing duties. As the character has some comedic moments, Universal brought in comedians Jay Leno, Garry Shandling, and Charles Fleischer, among others, but opted to go with actor David Clennon, who was better suited to play the dramatic elements.[42] Clennon had read for the Bennings character, but he preferred the option of playing Palmer's \"blue-collar stoner\" to a \"white collar science man\".[40] Powers Boothe,[11] Lee Van Cleef, Jerry Orbach, and Kevin Conway were considered for the role of Garry, and Richard Mulligan was also considered when the production experimented with the idea of making the character closer to MacReady in age.[43] Masur also read for Garry, but he asked to play Clark instead, as he liked the character's dialogue and was also a fan of dogs. Masur worked daily with the wolfdog Jed and his handler, Clint Rowe, during rehearsals, as Rowe was familiarizing Jed with the sounds and smells of people. This helped Masur's and Jed's performance onscreen, as the dog would stand next to him without looking for his handler. Masur described his character as one uninterested in people, but who loves working with dogs. He went to a survivalist store and bought a flip knife for his character, and used it in a confrontation with David's character.[40] Masur turned down a role in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial to play Clark.[44] William Daniels and Dennehy were both interested in playing Dr. Copper, and it was a last-second decision by Carpenter to go with Richard Dysart.[43]/nIn early drafts, Windows was called Sanchez, and later Sanders. The name Windows came when the actor for the role, Thomas Waites, was in a costume fitting and tried on a large pair of dark glasses, which the character wears in the film.[45] Russell described the all-male story as interesting since the men had no one to posture for without women.[36] Anita Dann served as casting director.[40]/nThe Thing was storyboarded extensively by Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner before filming began. Their work was so detailed that many of the film's shots replicate the image layout completely.[46] Cundey pushed for the use of anamorphic format aspect ratio, believing that it allowed for placing several actors in an environment, and making use of the scenic vistas available, while still creating a sense of confinement within the image. It also enabled the use of negative space around the actors to imply something may be lurking just offscreen.[14]/nPrincipal photography began on August 24, 1981, in Juneau, Alaska.[12][47] Filming lasted about twelve weeks.[48] Carpenter insisted on two weeks of rehearsals before filming as he wanted to see how scenes would play out. This was unusual at the time because of the expense involved.[34] Filming then moved to the Universal lot, where the outside heat was over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C). The internal sets were climate-controlled to 28\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122\u00a0\u00b0C) to facilitate their work.[36][47] The team considered building the sets inside an existing refrigerated structure but were unable to find one large enough. Instead, they collected as many portable air conditioners as they could, closed off the stage, and used humidifiers and misters to add moisture to the air.[49] After watching a roughly assembled cut of filming to date, Carpenter was unhappy that the film seemed to feature too many scenes of men standing around talking. He rewrote some already completed scenes to take place outdoors to be shot on location when principal photography moved to Stewart, British Columbia.[25][40]/nCarpenter was determined to use authentic locations instead of studio sets, and his successes on Halloween and The Fog (1980) gave him the credibility to take on the much bigger-budget production of The Thing. A film scout located an area just outside Stewart, along the Canadian coast, which offered the project both ease of access and scenic value during the day.[25] On December 2, 1981, roughly 100 American and Canadian crew members moved to the area to begin filming.[48] During the journey there, the crew bus slid in the snow toward the unprotected edge of the road, nearly sending it down a 500-foot (150\u00a0m) embankment.[44] Some of the crew stayed in the small mining town during filming, while others lived on residential barges on the Portland Canal.[40] They would make the 27-mile (43\u00a0km) drive up a small, winding road to the filming location in Alaska where the exterior outpost sets were built.[36][40][50]/nThe sets had been built in Alaska during the summer, atop a rocky area overlooking a glacier, in preparation for snow to fall and cover them.[25] They were used for both interior and exterior filming, meaning they could not be heated above freezing inside to ensure there was always snow on the roof. Outside, the temperature was so low that the camera lenses would freeze and break.[36] The crew had to leave the cameras in the freezing temperatures, as keeping them inside in the warmth resulted in foggy lenses that took hours to clear.[47] Filming, greatly dependent on the weather, took three weeks to complete,[49] with heavy snow making it impossible to film on some days.[40] Rigging the explosives necessary to destroy the set in the film's finale required 8 hours.[51]/nKeith David broke his hand in a car accident the day before he was to begin shooting. David attended filming the next day, but when Carpenter and Franco saw his swollen hand, they sent him to the hospital where it was punctured with two pins. He returned wearing a surgical glove beneath a black glove that was painted to resemble his complexion. His left hand is not seen for the first half of the film.[40] Carpenter filmed the Norwegian camp scenes after the end scenes, using the damaged American base as a stand-in for the charred Norwegian camp.[52] The explosive destruction of the base required the camera assistants to stand inside the set with the explosives, which were activated remotely. The assistants then had to run to a safe distance while seven cameras captured the base's destruction.[51] Filmed when the heavy use of special effects was rare, the actors had to adapt to having Carpenter describe to them what their characters were looking at, as the effects would not be added until post-production. There were some puppets used to create the impression of what was happening in the scene, but in other cases, the cast would be looking at a wall or an object marked with an X.[36]/nArt director John J. Lloyd oversaw the design and construction of all the sets, as there were no existing locations used in the film.[49] Cundey suggested that the sets should have ceilings and pipes seen on camera to make the spaces seem more claustrophobic.[49]/nSeveral scenes in the script were omitted from the film, sometimes because there was too much dialogue that slowed the pace and undermined the suspense. Carpenter blamed some of the issues on his directorial method, noting that several scenes appeared to be repeating events or information. Another scene featuring a snowmobile chase pursuing dogs was removed from the shooting script as it would have been too expensive to film. One scene present in the film, but not the script, features a monologue by MacReady. Carpenter added this partly to establish what was happening in the story and because he wanted to highlight Russell's heroic character after taking over the camp. Carpenter said that Lancaster's experience writing ensemble pieces did not emphasize single characters. Since Halloween, several horror films had replicated many of the scare elements of that film, something Carpenter wanted to move away from for The Thing. He removed scenes from Lancaster's script that had been filmed, such as a body suddenly falling into view at the Norwegian camp, which he felt were too clich\u00e9d.[23] Approximately three minutes of scenes were filmed from Lancaster's script that elaborated on the characters' backgrounds.[40]/nA scene with MacReady absentmindedly inflating a blow-up doll while watching the Norwegian tapes was filmed but was not used in the finished film. The doll would later appear as a jump scare with Nauls. Other scenes featured expanded or alternate deaths for various characters. In the finished film, Fuchs's charred bones are discovered, revealing he has died offscreen, but an alternate take sees his corpse impaled on a wall with a shovel. Nauls was scripted to appear in the finale as a partly assimilated mass of tentacles, but in the film, he simply disappears.[53] Carpenter struggled with a method of conveying to the audience what assimilation by the creature actually meant. Lancaster's original set piece of Bennings's death had him pulled beneath a sheet of ice by the Thing, before resurfacing in different areas in various stages of assimilation. The scene called for a set to be built on one of Universal's largest stages, with sophisticated hydraulics, dogs, and flamethrowers, but it was deemed too costly to produce.[54] A scene was filmed with Bennings being murdered by an unknown assailant, but it was felt that assimilation, leading to his death, was not explained enough. Short on time, and with no interior sets remaining, a small set was built, Maloney was covered with K-Y Jelly, orange dye, and rubber tentacles. Monster gloves for a different creature were repurposed to demonstrate partial assimilation.[53][54]/nCarpenter filmed multiple endings for The Thing, including a \"happier\" ending because editor Todd Ramsay thought that the bleak, nihilistic conclusion would not test well with audiences. In the alternate take, MacReady is rescued and given a blood test that proves he is not infected.[52][55] Carpenter said that stylistically this ending would have been \"cheesy\".[23] Editor Verna Fields was tasked with reworking the ending to add clarity and resolution. It was finally decided to create an entirely new scene, which omitted the suspicion of Childs being infected by removing him completely, leaving MacReady alone.[23] This new ending tested only slightly better with audiences than the original, and the production team agreed to the studio's request to use it.[56][57] It was set to go to print for theaters when the producers, Carpenter, and executive Helena Hacker decided that the film was better left with ambiguity instead of nothing at all. Carpenter gave his approval to restore the ambiguous ending, but a scream was inserted over the outpost explosion to posit the monster's death.[23][56] Universal executive Sidney Sheinberg disliked the ending's nihilism and, according to Carpenter, said, \"Think about how the audience will react if we see the [Thing] die with a giant orchestra playing\".[23][57] Carpenter later noted that both the original ending and the ending without Childs tested poorly with audiences, which he interpreted as the film simply not being heroic enough.[23]/nEnnio Morricone composed the film's score, as Carpenter wanted The Thing to have a European musical approach.[58][59] Carpenter flew to Rome to speak with Morricone to convince him to take the job. By the time Morricone flew to Los Angeles to record the score, he had already developed a tape filled with an array of synthesizer music because he was unsure what type of score Carpenter wanted.[60] Morricone wrote complete separate orchestral and synthesizer scores and a combined score, which he knew was Carpenter's preference.[61] Carpenter picked a piece, closely resembling his own scores, that became the main theme used throughout the film.[60] He also played the score from Escape from New York for Morricone as an example. Morricone made several more attempts, bringing the score closer to Carpenter's own style of music.[58] In total, Morricone produced a score of approximately one hour that remained largely unused but was later released as part of the film's soundtrack.[62] Carpenter and his longtime collaborator Alan Howarth separately developed some synth-styled pieces used in the film.[63] In 2012, Morricone recalled:/nI've asked [Carpenter], as he was preparing some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, \"Why did you call me, if you want to do it on your own?\" He surprised me, he said\u00a0\u2013 \"I got married to your music. This is why I've called you.\"\u00a0... Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [Carpenter] took the electronic score.[58]/nCarpenter said:/n[Morricone] did all the orchestrations and recorded for me 20 minutes of music I could use wherever I wished but without seeing any footage. I cut his music into the film and realized that there were places, mostly scenes of tension, in which his music would not work\u00a0... I secretly ran off and recorded in a couple of days a few pieces to use. My pieces were very simple electronic pieces\u00a0\u2013 it was almost tones. It was not really music at all but just background sounds, something today you might even consider as sound effects.[58]/nThe Thing's special effects were largely designed by Bottin,[32] who had previously worked with Carpenter on The Fog (1980).[64] When Bottin joined the project in mid-1981, pre-production was in progress, but no design had been settled on for the alien.[64] Artist Dale Kuipers had created some preliminary paintings of the creature's look, but he left the project after being hospitalized following a traffic accident before he could develop them further with Bottin.[12][64] Carpenter conceived the Thing as a single creature, but Bottin suggested that it should be constantly changing and able to look like anything.[28] Carpenter initially considered Bottin's description of his ideas as \"too weird\", and had him work with Ploog to sketch them instead.[64] As part of the Thing's design, it was agreed anyone assimilated by it would be a perfect imitation and would not know they were the Thing.[14] The actors spent hours during rehearsals discussing whether they would know they were the Thing when taken over. Clennon said that it did not matter, because everyone acted, looked and smelled exactly the same before (or after) being taken over.[40] At its peak, Bottin had a 35-person crew of artists and technicians, and he found it difficult to work with so many people. To help manage the team, he hired Erik Jensen, a special effects line producer who he had worked with on The Howling (1981), to be in charge of the special make-up effects unit.[65] Bottin's crew also included mechanical aspect supervisor Dave Kelsey, make-up aspect coordinator Ken Diaz, moldmaker Gunnar Ferdinansen, and Bottin's longtime friend Margaret Beserra, who managed painting and hair work.[65]/nIn designing the Thing's different forms, Bottin explained that the creature had been all over the galaxy. This allowed it to call on different attributes as necessary, such as stomachs that transform into giant mouths and spider legs sprouting from heads.[32] Bottin said the pressure he experienced caused him to dream about working on designs, some of which he would take note of after waking.[64] One abandoned idea included a series of dead baby monsters, which was deemed \"too gross\".[12] Bottin admitted he had no idea how his designs would be implemented practically, but Carpenter did not reject them. Carpenter said, \"What I didn't want to end up with in this movie was a guy in a suit\u00a0... I grew up as a kid watching science-fiction monster movies, and it was always a guy in a suit.\"[55] According to Cundey, Bottin was very sensitive about his designs, and worried about the film showing too many of them.[52] At one point, as a preemptive move against any censorship, Bottin suggested making the creature's violent transformations and the appearance of the internal organs more fantastical using colors. The decision was made to tone down the color of the blood and viscera, although much of the filming had been completed by that point.[28] The creature effects used a variety of materials including mayonnaise, creamed corn, microwaved bubble gum, and K-Y Jelly.[24]/nDuring filming, then-21-year-old Bottin was hospitalized for exhaustion, double pneumonia, and a bleeding ulcer, caused by his extensive workload. Bottin himself explained he would \"hoard the work\", opting to be directly involved in many of the complicated tasks.[66] His dedication to the project saw him spend over a year living on the Universal lot. Bottin said he did not take a day off during that time and slept on the sets or in locker rooms.[12] To take some pressure off his crew, Bottin enlisted the aid of special effects creator Stan Winston to complete some of the designs, primarily the Dog-Thing.[52][65] With insufficient time to create a sophisticated mechanical creature, Winston opted to create a hand puppet. A cast was made of makeup artist Lance Anderson's arm and head, around which the Dog-Thing was sculpted in oil-based clay. The final foam-latex puppet, worn by Anderson, featured radio-controlled eyes and cable-controlled legs,[67] and was operated from below a raised set on which the kennel was built.[67][25] Slime from the puppet would leak onto Anderson during the two days it took to film the scene, and he had to wear a helmet to protect himself from the explosive squibs simulating gunfire. Anderson pulled the tentacles into the Dog-Thing and reverse motion was used to create the effect of them slithering from its body.[67] Winston refused to be credited for his work, insisting that Bottin deserved sole credit; Winston was given a \"thank you\" in the credits instead.[52][65]/nIn the \"chest chomp\" scene, Dr. Copper attempts to revive Norris with a defibrillator. Revealing himself as the Thing, Norris-Thing's chest transforms into a large mouth that severs Copper's arms. Bottin accomplished this scene by recruiting a double amputee and fitting him with prosthetic arms filled with wax bones, rubber veins and Jell-O. The arms were then placed into the practical \"stomach mouth\" where the mechanical jaws clamped down on them, at which point the actor pulled away, severing the false arms.[52] The effect of the Norris-Thing's head detaching from the body to save itself took many months of testing before Bottin was satisfied enough to film it. The scene involved a fire effect, but the crew were unaware that fumes from the rubber foam chemicals inside the puppet were flammable. The fire ignited the fumes, creating a large fireball that engulfed the puppet. It suffered only minimal damage after the fire had been put out, and the crew successfully filmed the scene.[44][68] Stop-motion expert Randall William Cook developed a sequence for the end of the film where MacReady is confronted by the gigantic Blair-Thing. Cook created a miniature model of the set and filmed wide-angle shots of the monster in stop motion, but Carpenter was not convinced by the effect and used only a few seconds of it.[52] It took fifty people to operate the actual Blair-Thing puppet.[14]/nThe production intended to use a camera centrifuge\u00a0\u2013 a rotating drum with a fixed camera platform\u00a0\u2013 for the Palmer-Thing scene, allowing him to seem to run straight up the wall and across the ceiling. Again, the cost was too high and the idea abandoned for a stuntman falling into frame onto a floor made to look like the outpost's ceiling.[69] Stuntman Anthony Cecere stood in for the Palmer-Thing after MacReady sets it on fire and it crashes through the outpost wall.[70]/nCundey worked with Bottin to determine the appropriate lighting for each creature. He wanted to show off Bottin's work because of its details, but he was conscious that showing too much would reveal its artificial nature, breaking the illusion. Each encounter with the creature was planned for areas where they could justify using a series of small lights to highlight the particular creature-model's surface and textures. Cundey would illuminate the area behind the creature to detail its overall shape. He worked with Panavision and a few other companies to develop a camera capable of automatically adjusting light exposure at different film speeds. He wanted to try filming the creature at fast and slow speeds thinking this would create a more interesting visual effect, but they were unable to accomplish this at the time. For the rest of the set, Cundey created a contrast by lighting the interiors with warmer lights hung overhead in conical shades so that they could still control the lighting and have darkened areas on set. The outside was constantly bathed in a cold, blue light that Cundey had discovered being used on airport runways. The reflective surface of the snow and the blue light helped create the impression of coldness.[25] The team also made use of the flamethrowers and magenta-hued flares used by the actors to create dynamic lighting.[25]/nThe team originally wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, but Universal was reluctant as it could affect their ability to sell the television rights for the film. Instead, Cundey suggested muting the colors as much as possible. The inside of the sets were painted in neutral colors such as gray, and many of the props were also painted gray, while the costumes were a mix of somber browns, blues, and grays. They relied on the lighting to add color.[49] Albert Whitlock provided matte-painted backdrops, including the scene in which the Americans discover the giant alien spaceship buried in the ice.[25] A scene where MacReady walks up to a hole in the ice where the alien had been buried was filmed at Universal, while the surrounding area, including the alien spaceship, helicopter, and snow, were all painted.[14]/nCarpenter's friend John Wash, who developed the opening computer simulation for Escape from New York, designed the computer program showing how the Thing assimilates other organisms.[14] Model maker Susan Turner built the alien ship approaching Earth in the pre-credits sequence, which featured 144 strobing lights.[71] Drew Struzan designed the film's poster. He completed it in 24 hours, based only on a briefing, knowing little about the film.[72]/nThe lack of information about the film's special effects drew the attention of film exhibitors in early 1982. They wanted reassurance that The Thing was a first-rate production capable of attracting audiences. Cohen and Foster, with a specially employed editor and Universal's archive of music, put together a 20-minute showreel emphasizing action and suspense. They used available footage, including alternate and extended scenes not in the finished film, but avoided revealing the special effects as much as possible. The reaction from the exclusively male exhibitors was generally positive, and Universal executive Robert Rehme told Cohen that the studio was counting on The Thing's success, as they expected E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial to appeal only to children.[73] While finalizing the film, Universal sent Carpenter a demographic study showing that the audience appeal of horror films had declined by seventy percent over the previous six months. Carpenter considered this a suggestion that he lower his expectations of the film's performance.[28] After one market research screening, Carpenter queried the audience on their thoughts, and one audience member asked, \"Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing\u00a0...?\" When Carpenter responded that it was up to their imagination, the audience member responded, \"Oh, God. I hate that.\"[23]/nAfter returning from a screening of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the audience's silence at a The Thing trailer caused Foster to remark, \"We're dead\".[74] The response to public pre-screenings of The Thing resulted in the studio changing the somber, black-and-white advertising approved by the producers to a color image of a person with a glowing face. The tagline was also changed from \"Man is the warmest place to hide\"\u00a0\u2013 written by Stephen Frankfort, who wrote the Alien tagline, \"In space, no one can hear you scream\"\u00a0\u2013 to \"The ultimate in alien terror\", trying to capitalize on Alien's audience. Carpenter attempted to make a last-minute change of the film's title to Who Goes There?, to no avail.[74] The week before its release, Carpenter promoted the film with clips on Late Night with David Letterman.[75] In 1981, horror magazine Fangoria held a contest encouraging readers to submit drawings of what the Thing would look like. Winners were rewarded with a trip to Universal Studios.[44] On its opening day, a special screening was held at the Hollywood Pacific Theatre, presided over by Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, with free admission for those in costume as monsters.[74]/nThe Thing was released in the United States on June 25, 1982.[12] During its opening weekend, the film earned $3.1\u00a0million from 840 theaters\u00a0\u2013 an average of $3,699 per theater\u00a0\u2013 finishing as the number eight film of the weekend behind supernatural horror Poltergeist ($4.1\u00a0million), which was in its fourth weekend of release, and ahead of action film Megaforce ($2.3\u00a0million).[76][77] It dropped out of the top\u00a010 grossing films after three weeks,[78] and ended its run earning a total of $19.6\u00a0million against its $15\u00a0million budget, making it only the 42nd highest-grossing film of 1982.[c][55][76][79] It was not a box office failure, nor was it a hit.[80] Subsequent theatrical releases have raised the box office gross to $19.9\u00a0million as of 2023[update].[81]/nI take every failure hard. The one I took the hardest was The Thing. My career would have been different if that had been a big hit\u00a0... The movie was hated. Even by science-fiction fans. They thought that I had betrayed some kind of trust, and the piling on was insane. Even the original movie's director, Christian Nyby, was dissing me./n\u2014 John Carpenter in 2008 on the contemporary reception of The Thing[82]/nThe film received negative reviews on its release, and hostility for its cynical, anti-authoritarian tone and graphic special effects.[83][84] Some reviewers were dismissive of the film, calling it the \"quintessential moron movie of the 80's\", \"instant junk\",[9] and a \"wretched excess\".[85] Starlog's Alan Spencer called it a \"cold and sterile\" horror movie attempting to cash in on the genre audience, against the \"optimism of E.T., the reassuring return of Star Trek II, the technical perfection of Tron, and the sheer integrity of Blade Runner\".[86]/nThe plot was criticized as \"boring\",[87] and undermined by the special effects.[88] The Los Angeles Times's Linda Gross said that The Thing was \"bereft, despairing, and nihilistic\", and lacking in feeling, meaning the characters' deaths did not matter.[89] Spencer said it featured sloppy continuity, lacked pacing, and was devoid of warmth or humanity.[86] David Ansen of Newsweek felt the film confused the use of effects with creating suspense, and that it lacked drama by \"sacrificing everything at the altar of gore\".[88] The Chicago Reader's Dave Kehr considered the dialogue to be banal and interchangeable, making the characters seem and sound alike.[90] The Washington Post's Gary Arnold said it was a witty touch to open with the Thing having already overcome the Norwegian base, defeating the type of traps seen in the 1951 version,[85] while New York's David Denby lamented that the Thing's threat is shown only externally, without focusing on what it is like for someone who thinks they have been taken over.[87] Roger Ebert considered the film to be scary, but offering nothing original beyond the special effects,[91] while The New York Times's Vincent Canby said it was entertaining only if the viewer needed to see spider-legged heads and dog autopsies.[9]/nReviews of the actors' performances were generally positive,[92][86] while criticizing the depictions of the characters they portrayed.[91][93][88] Ebert said they lacked characterization, offering basic stereotypes that existed just to be killed, and Spencer called the characters bland even though the actors do the best they can with the material.[91][86] Time's Richard Schickel singled Russell out as the \"stalwart\" hero, where other characters were not as strongly or wittily characterized,[92] and Variety said that Russell's heroic status was undercut by the \"suicidal\" attitude adopted toward the film's finale.[93] Other reviews criticized implausibilities such as characters wandering off alone.[91] Kehr did not like that the men did not band together against the Thing, and several reviews noted a lack of camaraderie and romance, which Arnold said reduced any interest beyond the special effects.[88][85][90]/nThe film's special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive.[87][92][85] Cinefantastique wrote that the Thing \"may be the most unloved monster in movie history\u00a0... but it's also the most incredible display of special effects makeup in at least a decade.\"[94] Reviews called Bottin's work \"genius\",[87][86] noting the designs were novel, unforgettable, \"colorfully horrific\", and called him a \"master of the macabre\".[92][85] Arnold said that the \"chest chomp\" scene demonstrated \"appalling creativity\" and the subsequent severed head scene was \"madly macabre\", comparing them to Alien's chest burster and severed head scenes.[85] Variety called it \"the most vividly gruesome horror film to ever stalk the screens\".[93] Conversely, Denby called them more disgusting than frightening and lamented that the trend of horror films to open the human body more and more bordered on obscenity.[87] Spencer said that Bottin's care and pride in his craft were shown in the effects, but both they and Schickel found them to be overwhelming and \"squandered\" without strong characters and story.[92][86] Even so, Canby said that the effects were too \"phony looking to be disgusting\".[9] Canby and Arnold said the creature's lack of a single, discernible shape was to its detriment, and hiding it inside humans made it hard to follow. Arnold said that the 1951 version was less versatile but easier to keep in focus.[85][9]/nGross and Spencer praised the film's technical achievements, particularly Cundey's \"frostbitten\" cinematography, the sound, editing, and Morricone's score.[89][86] Spencer was critical of Carpenter's direction, saying it was his \"futile\" attempt to give the audience what he thinks they want and that Carpenter was not meant to direct science fiction, but was instead suited to direct \"traffic accidents, train wrecks, and public floggings\".[86] Ansen said that \"atrocity for atrocity's sake\" was ill-becoming of Carpenter.[88]/nThe Thing was often compared to similar films, particularly Alien, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), and The Thing from Another World.[91][87][9] Ebert and Denby said that The Thing seemed derivative compared to those films, which had portrayed the story in a better way.[91][87] Variety called it inferior to the 1951 version.[93] Arnold considered The Thing as the result of Alien raising the requirement for horrific spectacle.[85]/nThe Thing from Another World actor Kenneth Tobey and director Christian Nyby also criticized the film. Nyby said, \"If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse\u00a0... All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch\".[44] Tobey singled out the visual effects, saying they \"were so explicit that they actually destroyed how you were supposed to feel about the characters\u00a0... They became almost a movie in themselves, and were a little too horrifying.\"[80] In Phil Hardy's 1984 book Science Fiction, a reviewer described the film as a \"surprising failure\" and called it \"Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date\".[95] The review noted that the narrative \"seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero is no more than a cypher compared to Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' The Thing\".[95] Clennon said that introductory scenes for the characters, omitted from the film, made it hard for audiences to connect with them, robbing it of some of the broader appeal of Alien.[40]/nThe Thing received nominations from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films for Best Horror Film and Best Special Effects,[96] but lost to Poltergeist and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, respectively.[97] The film was nominated at the Razzie Awards for Worst Musical Score.[98]/nIn a 1999 interview, Carpenter said audiences rejected The Thing for its nihilistic, depressing viewpoint at a time when the United States was in the midst of a recession.[23] When it opened, it was competing against the critically and commercially successful E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ($619\u00a0million), a family-friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic take on alien visitation.[14][99][100]  Carpenter described it as the complete opposite of his film.[44] The Thing opened on the same day as the science fiction film Blade Runner, which debuted as the number two film that weekend with a take of $6.1\u00a0million and went on to earn $33.8\u00a0million.[77][101] It was also regarded as a critical and commercial failure at the time.[80] Others blamed an oversaturation of science fiction and fantasy films released that year, including Conan the Barbarian ($130\u00a0million), Poltergeist ($121.7\u00a0million), Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ($97\u00a0million), Mad Max 2 ($34.5\u00a0million), and Tron ($33\u00a0million). Some analysts blamed Universal's poor marketing, which did not compete with the deluge of promotion for prominent films released that summer.[80][100][102] Another factor was the R rating it was given, restricting the audience to those over the age of 17 unless accompanied by an adult. In contrast, Poltergeist, another horror film, received a PG rating, allowing families and younger children to view it.[80]/nThe impact on Carpenter was immediate\u00a0\u2013 he lost the job of directing the 1984 science fiction horror film Firestarter because of The Thing's poor performance.[103] His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead.[104] He continued making films afterward but lost confidence, and did not openly talk about The Thing's failure until a 1985 interview with Starlog, where he said, \"I was called 'a pornographer of violence'\u00a0... I had no idea it would be received that way\u00a0... The Thing was just too strong for that time. I knew it was going to be strong, but I didn't think it would be too strong\u00a0... I didn't take the public's taste into consideration.\"[80] Shortly after its release, Wilbur Stark sued Universal for $43\u00a0million for \"slander, breach of contract, fraud and deceit\", alleging he incurred a financial loss by Universal failing to credit him properly in its marketing and by showing his name during the end credits, a less prestigious position.[19] Stark also said that he \"contributed greatly to the [screenplay]\".[105] David Foster responded that Stark was not involved with the film's production in any way, and received proper credit in all materials.[106] Stark later sued for a further $15\u00a0million over Foster's comments. The outcome of the lawsuits is unknown.[107]/nWhile The Thing was not initially successful, it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on home video, and later on television.[108] Sidney Sheinberg edited a version of the film for network television broadcast, which added narration and a different ending, where the Thing imitates a dog and escapes the ruined camp. Carpenter disowned this version, and theorized that Sheinberg had been mad at him for not taking his creative ideas on board for the theatrical cut.[109][110][111]/nThe Thing was released on DVD in 1998 and featured additional content, such as The Thing: Terror Takes Shape\u00a0\u2013 a detailed documentary on the production, deleted and alternate scenes, and commentary by Carpenter and Russell.[112][113] An HD DVD version followed in 2006 containing the same features,[114][115] and a Blu-ray version in 2008 featuring just the Carpenter and Russell commentary, and some behind-the-scenes videos available via picture-in-picture during the film.[116][117] A 2016 Blu-ray release featured a 2K resolution restoration of the film, overseen by Dean Cundey. As well as including previous features such as the commentary and Terror Takes Shape, it added interviews with the cast and crew, and segments that focus on the music, writing, editing, Ploog's artwork, an interview with Alan Dean Foster, who wrote the film's novelization, and the television broadcast version of The Thing that runs fifteen minutes shorter than the theatrical cut.[118] A 4K\u00a0resolution restoration was released in 2017 on Blu-ray, initially as a United Kingdom exclusive with a limited run of eight thousand units. The restoration was created using the original film negative, and was overseen by Carpenter and Cundey.[119] A 4K\u00a0Ultra HD Blu-ray was released in September 2021.[120]/nMCA released the soundtrack for The Thing in 1982.[121] Var\u00e8se Sarabande re-released it in 1991 on compact disc and Compact Cassette.[122] These versions eventually ceased being manufactured. In 2011, Howarth and Larry Hopkins restored Morricone's score using updated digital techniques and arranged each track in the order it appears in the film. The album also includes tracks composed by Carpenter and Howarth for the film.[123] A remastered version of the score was released on vinyl on February 23, 2017; a deluxe edition included an exclusive interview with Carpenter.[124] In May 2020, an extended play (EP), Lost Cues: The Thing, was released. The EP contains Carpenter's contributions to The Thing's score; he re-recorded the music because the original masterings were lost.[125]/nA novelization of the film was published by Alan Dean Foster in 1982.[118] It is based on an earlier draft of the script and features some differences from the finished film.[126] A scene in which MacReady, Bennings, and Childs chase infected dogs out into the snow is included,[127] and Nauls's disappearance is explained: Cornered by the Blair-Thing, he chooses suicide over assimilation.[128]/nIn 2000, McFarlane Toys released two \"Movie Maniacs\" figures: the Blair-Thing[129] and the Norris-Thing, including its spider-legged, disembodied head.[130] SOTA Toys released a set featuring a MacReady figure and the Dog-Thing based on the film's kennel scene,[131] as well as a bust of the Norris-Thing's spider-head.[132] In 2017, Mondo and the Project Raygun division of USAopoly released The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31, a board game. Players take on the role of characters from the film or the Thing, each aiming to defeat the other through subterfuge and sabotage.[133][134]/nIn April 2023, it was announced that The Thing and characters from the film would be featured in the upcoming video game, Funko Fusion, set to be released in 2024. The game is set to include R.J. MacReady, Childs and Dr. Copper.[135][136]/nIn November 2023, it was announced that The Thing would be featured in the video game, Pinball M. The Thing Pinball, a table based on the film, was released on November 30, 2023. The table includes R.J. MacReady and various other elements from the film.[137][138]/nThe central theme of The Thing concerns paranoia and mistrust.[139][140][141] Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community,[142] instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy.[143][141] It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies.[141] The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. The Thing focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions.[144]/nDeveloped in an era of cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by mutually assured destruction. Diabolique's Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being checkmated, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team.[145] The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. Screen Rant's Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between The Thing and the accusatory Red Scares and McCarthyism, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation.[140][145] Slant Magazine's John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-Vietnam War (1955\u20131975) \"fatigued counterculturalism\"\u00a0\u2013 the rejection of conventional social norms, each defined by their own eccentricities.[142]/nThe Atlantic's Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, women are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual.[139] Vice's Patrick Marlborough considered The Thing to be a \"scathing examination\" of manliness, noting that identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but \"male frailty\" prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure.[144] Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other.[139]/nNerdist's Kyle Anderson and Strange Horizons's Orrin Grey analyzed The Thing as an example of author H. P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror.[147][146] Anderson's analysis includes the idea of cosmic horror in large part coming \"from the fear of being overtaken,\" connecting it to Lovecraft's xenophobia and Blair's character arc of becoming what he most fears. In contrast, Anderson compares Blair to MacReady, who represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist.[147] Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self, using Blair's character as an example. Discussing The Thing in the context of the first of three films in Carpenter's \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", Grey states the threat the monster poses to the world \"is less disconcerting than the threat posed to the individual concept of self.\"[146]/nThe Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal.[148] Den of Geek's Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over.[149][150] In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe The Thing as \"pro-science\" like Who Goes There? or \"anti-science\" like The Thing from Another World, Carpenter chose \"pro-human\", stating, \"It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon.\"[70] Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the epidemic of HIV at the time, which could be identified only by a blood test.[14][151]/nSince its release, many theories have been developed to attempt to answer the film's ambiguous ending shared by MacReady and Childs.[152] Several suggest that Childs was infected, citing Dean Cundey's statement that he deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of uninfected characters, something absent from Childs. Similarly, others have noted a lack of visible breath from the character in the frigid air. While both aspects are present in MacReady, their absence in Childs has been explained as a technical issue with the filming.[153][154] During production, Carpenter considered having MacReady be infected,[155] and an alternate ending showed MacReady having been rescued and definitively tested as uninfected.[52] Russell has said that analyzing the scene for clues is \"missing the point\". He continued, \"[Carpenter] and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn't know anything\u00a0... They didn't know if they knew who they were\u00a0... I love that, over the years, that movie has gotten its due because people were able to get past the horrificness of the monster\u00a0... to see what the movie was about, which was paranoia.\"[152] However, Carpenter has teased, \"Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you.\"[156]/nIn the years following its release, critics and fans have reevaluated The Thing as a milestone of the horror genre.[40] A prescient review by Peter Nicholls in 1992 called The Thing \"a bleak, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic\".[157] It has been called one of the best films directed by Carpenter.[36][158][159] John Kenneth Muir called it \"Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort\",[160] and critic Matt Zoller Seitz said it \"is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made\".[161]/nTrace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever,[162] and in 2008, Empire magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time,[163] at number 289, calling it \"a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror\".[55] It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made,[160][164] and a classic of the genre.[165] Several publications have called it one of the best films of 1982, including Filmsite.org,[166] Film.com,[167] and Entertainment Weekly.[156] Muir called it \"the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade\".[160] Complex named it the ninth-best of the decade, calling it the \"greatest genre remake of all time\".[168] Numerous publications have ranked it as one of the best science fiction films, including number four by IGN (2016);[169] number\u00a012 by Thrillist (2018);[170] number\u00a017 by GamesRadar+ (2018);[171] number 31 by Paste (2018);[172] number 32 by Esquire (2015) and Popular Mechanics (2017);[173][174] and number 76 by Rotten Tomatoes (2017) based on its average review score.[175]/nSimilarly, The Thing has appeared on several lists of the top horror films, including number one by The Boston Globe;[164] number two by Bloody Disgusting (2018);[176] number four by Empire (2016);[177] and number six by Time Out (2016).[178] Empire listed its poster as the 43rd best film poster ever.[72] In 2016, the British Film Institute named it one of ten great films about aliens visiting Earth.[179] It was voted the ninth best horror film of all time in a Rolling Stone readers poll,[165] and is considered one of the best examples of body horror.[180][181][182][183] GamesRadar+ listed its ending as one of the 25 best of all time.[184] Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which has compiled old and contemporary reviews, reports that 85% of 84 critics provided positive reviews for the film, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter's The Thing is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects.\"[185] On Metacritic, a similar website that aggregates both past and present reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[186]/nIn a 2011 interview, Carpenter remarked that it was perhaps his favorite film from his own filmography. He lamented that it took a long time for The Thing to find a wider audience, saying, \"If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine (1983) and Starman (1984) and Big Trouble in Little China (1986), all those films. But my career would have been different.\"[187]/nThe film has had a significant impact on popular culture,[162] and by 1998, The Thing was already considered a cult classic.[156][55] It is listed in the film reference book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, which says \"one of the most influential horror movies of the 1980s, much imitated but rarely bettered\u00a0... It is one of the first films to unflinchingly show the rupture and warp of flesh and bone into grotesque tableaus of surreal beauty, forever raising the bar of cinematic horror.\"[188] It has been referred to in a variety of media, from television (including The X-Files, Futurama, and Stranger Things) to games (Resident Evil 4, Tomb Raider III,[162] Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden,[189] and Among Us),[190] and films (The Faculty, Slither, The Mist).[162]/nSeveral filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for The Thing or cited its influence on their own work, including Guillermo del Toro,[191] James DeMonaco,[192] J. J. Abrams,[193] Neill Blomkamp,[194] David Robert Mitchell,[195] Rob Hardy,[196] Steven S. DeKnight,[197] and Quentin Tarantino.[198] In 2011, The New York Times asked prominent horror filmmakers what film they had found the scariest. Two, John Sayles and Edgar Wright, cited The Thing.[199] The 2015 Tarantino film The Hateful Eight takes numerous cues from The Thing, from featuring Russell in a starring role, to replicating themes of paranoia and mistrust between characters restricted to a single location, and even duplicating certain angles and layouts used by Carpenter and Cundey.[198] Pieces of Morricone's unused score for The Thing were repurposed for The Hateful Eight.[61] Tarantino also cited The Thing as an inspiration for his 1992 film Reservoir Dogs.[12]/nThe film is screened annually in February to mark the beginning of winter at the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station.[12][200] In January 2010, Clarkesworld Magazine published \"The Things\", a short story by Peter Watts told from the Thing's point of view; it is unable to understand why humans are hostile toward it and horrified to learn that they do not shapeshift. The story received a 2011 Hugo Award nomination.[12][201] In 2017, a 400-page art book was released featuring art inspired by The Thing, with contributions from 350 artists, a foreword by director Eli Roth, and an afterword by Carpenter.[202]/nThe 2007 Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, featured \"The Thing: Assimilation\", a haunted attraction based on the film. The attraction included MacReady and Childs, both held in stasis, the Blair-Thing and the outpost kennel.[203][204]/nDark Horse Comics published four comic book sequels starring MacReady, beginning in December 1991 with the two-part The Thing from Another World by Chuck Pfarrer, which is set 24 hours after the film.[205][206] Pfarrer was reported to have pitched his comic tale to Universal as a sequel in the early 1990s.[205] This was followed by the four-part The Thing from Another World: Climate of Fear in July 1992,[207] the four-part The Thing from Another World: Eternal Vows in December 1993,[208] and The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research.[209] In 1999, Carpenter said that no serious discussions had taken place for a sequel, but he would be interested in basing one on Pfarrer's adaptation, calling the story a worthy sequel.[23][205] A 2002 video game of the same name was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and Xbox to generally favorable reviews.[210][211] The game's plot follows a team of U.S. soldiers investigating the aftermath of the film's events.[212]/nIn 2005, the Syfy channel planned a four-hour miniseries sequel produced by Frank Darabont and written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. The story followed a Russian team who recover the corpses of MacReady and Childs, as well as remnants of the Thing. The story moves forward 23 years, where the Thing escapes in New Mexico, and follows the attempts at containment. The project never proceeded, and Universal opted to continue with a feature film sequel.[213] A prequel film, also titled The Thing, was released in October 2011 to a $31\u00a0million worldwide box office gross and mixed reviews.[214][215][216][217] The story follows the events after the Norwegian team discovers the Thing.[216] In 2020, Universal Studios and Blumhouse Productions announced the development of a remake of Carpenter's The Thing. The remake was described as incorporating elements of The Thing from Another World and The Thing, as well as the novella Who Goes There? and its expanded version Frozen Hell, which features several additional chapters.[218]/nAlthough released years apart, and unrelated in terms of plot, characters, crew, or even production studios, Carpenter considers The Thing to be the first installment in his \"Apocalypse Trilogy\", a series of films based around cosmic horror, entities unknown to man, that are threats to both human life and the sense of self. The Thing was followed by Prince of Darkness in 1987, and In the Mouth of Madness in 1994. All three films are heavily influenced by Carpenter's appreciation for the works of Lovecraft.[219][146]", "18804903": "Hubert Simon Markl (17 August 1938 \u2013 8 January 2015)[3] was a German biologist who also served as president of the Max Planck Society from 1996 to 2002.[2][4][5][6][7]/nMarkl was born on 17 August 1938 in Regensburg, Germany.

In addition, he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, an Honorary Lecturer at Makerere University in Uganda, a Member of the Committee of Research and Exploration at National Geographic,[1] and an Associate Scientists of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York.  Prior to taking on his position at McGill University, he was at the University of Florida in the Department of Zoology from 1993 to 2004.  He is internationally recognized for his 30+ years of research into primate ecology, population regulation, nutrition, and disease dynamics and for his contribution to conservation globally./nHe is Director of the Kibale Monkey Project; a long-term project in Kibale National Park, Uganda that he started in 1989, building on the data of Thomas Struhsaker from Duke University who worked in Kibale from 1970 to 1987.[2]  The project focuses on primate ecology and conservation, but also has a very strong component examining forest dynamics, including those driven by climate change, elephant numbers, and forest succession.  The team of researchers he has worked with have also placed a heavy emphasis on conservation strategies, including forest regeneration, animal population recovery, fragmentation, people-parks relationships, zoonotic disease spread, and the link between providing health care and conservation./nChapman was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and he did all of his degrees (B.Sc., MA. Ph.D.) at the University of Alberta and obtained a joint Ph.D. under the supervision of Drs. Linda Fedigan, John Addicott, and Jan Murie.  He went on to do a Post-doc with Louis Lefebvre in Biology at McGill University and then Richard Wrangham in Anthropology at Harvard University.  Prior to coming to Harvard he conducted primate research in the Caribbean (St. Kitts) and Costa Rica, but when at Harvard he started research in Kibale National Park, Uganda./nHis interest in conservation started in Costa Rica as this was the time of the growth and the countries park system and he conducted surveys in the area that was to become Guanacaste National Park, with the aim of helping Daniel Janzen evaluate wildlife recovery. But conservation became the tenet of his research in Uganda, where he helped establish Makerere University Biological Field Station,[3] develop the chimpanzee ecotourism, encouraged the local community to establish small scale but sustainable ecotourism efforts, aided in fisheries management plans, worked on evaluating forest regeneration for the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[4][5] He contributed to making Kibale field stations sustainable through forming a consortium of University users and establishing a core of courses to come to the station (Canadian Field Studies in Africa, Tropical Biology Association, Makerere University, Waterloo),[6] and established a clinic and then a mobile clinic. The clinics act as an instrument between the park and the local communities as the clinics provide subsidized health care in return for improved park-people relationship.[7]  Throughout this time he put a great deal of effort into the training of Ugandan students and park personnel./nEarly in his career he was interested in ecological factors influencing group size, social organization, and population regulation, and it was this later interest that led him to conservation \u2013 that and the plight of primates that he witnessed through the course of his research. Early in his Ph.D. he became interested in that determined the size of spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) groups and this eventually lead him to formalize what he coined the Ecological Constraints Model.[8]  A challenge from Daniel Janzen to show that primates had any ecologically significant role lead him to study seed dispersal and then the role of primates in forest regeneration of tropical tree dynamics. Forest regeneration remained a subject that he revisited throughout his research career to demonstrate the longitudinal dynamics of regeneration as observed in different parts of the forest that experienced different degrees of disturbance in the past.[9][10]/nWhile in Kibale he became fascinated with red colobus and the determinants of both their group size, that can lead to groups of over 150 individuals, and variation in abundance. This led him to study nutritional ecology, disease ecology, and to document long-term change. It was his friendship with Tom Struhsaker from Duke University and the extensive data that encompassed research from 1970 to 1987 that really lead Dr. Chapman to quantify long-term patterns. This data became invaluable when globally researchers became aware of climate change and the fact that old growth forests were much more dynamic than previously believed.[citation needed]/nChapman has worked on issues dealing with understanding animal group size and composition since his Ph.D. and formalized the Ecological Constraints Model.  The ideas are relatively simple.  Various researchers have suggested that grouping confers such predictable benefits that differences in group size can be explained by the disadvantages.[11] The most widely accepted potential cost of grouping is thought to be a reduction in foraging efficiency. Being with other individuals with the same dietary requirements means that animals either fight over food, or one animal in a group beats another to the food, thus when the second animal comes to an area there is simply no food left. In both of these situations it is thought that competition over food leads to animals having to travel farther as the size of the group increases. The logic behind this argument is relatively simple. Animals must forage over an area that can meet their energetic and nutritional requirements. It follows that an increase in group size will increase the area that must be covered to find adequate food supplies. Thus individuals must travel further and expend more energy if they are in a large group, than if they forage in a smaller group. With an increase in the time spent traveling, a point is approached where the energy spent in travel is too costly and smaller groups become advantageous. In this way ecological factors can influence movement patterns and foraging efficiency, thereby constraining the size of groups that can efficiently exploit available food resources. These ideas have been formalized in what has become known as the Ecological Constraints Model[8][12] and have been shown to predict group size in a variety of primates and other species.[13]/nThe Ecological Constraint Model has been found to be supported in different primate species with a variety of diet, such as, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),[14] spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi),[14] red colobus (Procolobus pennantii),[15] red-tailed guenon (Cercopithecus ascanius),[15]  and ursine colobus monkeys (Colobus vellerosus)./nTropical forests are some of the most beautiful and biodiverse ecosystem on the face of the planet, yet they are gravely threatened. Recent global assessments report that 2.3 million km2 of forest was lost between 2000 and 2012 and in the tropics forest loss increased by 2101\u00a0km2 per year.[16]  Ultimately, changes in forest cover are driven by increased human population size and natural resource consumption rates.  In African countries with tropical forest, human population density increased from 8 people per km2 in 1950 to 35 people per km2 in 2010.[17]  This increasingly dire situation not only threatens biodiversity, but it is clear that extreme poverty and this rapid loss of biodiversity are intimately linked, with extreme poverty and biodiversity hotspots being geographically coincident.  The people living next to tropical protected areas are some of the poorest people in the world and suffer from often acute health problems.  For example, in Uganda the country that Chapman has worked in for the last 27+ years, 30% of all deaths among children between the ages of 2 and 4 are caused by malaria, a disease that could be easily treated or prevented; and 26% of children under the age of five are malnourished.[7]  This situation means that for effective conservation to occur the local community must be involved, which often means they receive benefits. Chapman has implemented systems that link health provision and conservation.  Receiving money or employment from the park is definitely beneficial and appreciated, but saving the life of a young child suffering from malaria is enormous and its benefit unmeasurable to the parent. Chapman, first established a clinic to meet the health needs of the local people and subsequently since Kibale is large and many people could not travel to the clinic, he brought an ambulance from Canada to Kibale to act as a mobile clinic.  The Mobile Health Clinic travels around the park, bringing basic health care, family planning, deworming, HIV/AIDS treatment and counselling, vaccinations, and health and conservation education to remote villagers.  The staff also provide public talks on disease prevention. Chapman has taken this sort of approach of working with the local community to help them obtain the needs they identify, while still administering strict wildlife protection in all of his conservation efforts.", "48754864": "Julian Charles Rayner is a New Zealand malaria researcher, and the Director of the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, part of the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine.

After some time, he transferred to the Pushchino's Middle School #2 (1970-1973).\nFrom 1973 to 1978 Kondrashov studied in the College of Genetics of Biology Department of the Moscow State University-Lomonosov. In 1984, he received his Ph.D. degree in Biology form The Moscow State University.[6][7] In 1990, Kondrashov became an Associate Visiting Scientist in the Department of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison.[8] He became an Assistant Professor of Ecology and Systematics at Cornell University in 1993, and associate professor in 1996. He is currently[when?] a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan./nOne of the works of Alexey Kondrashov is called the Kondrashov Hypothesis or the deterministic mutation hypothesis. This hypothesis explains the benefits of sexual reproduction.[9] Kondrashov argues that because of the slightly deleterious effect of mutations the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Because of the recombination effect of the sex on the genotypes the individuals with fewer and more deleterious mutations will be created. Since there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out.[10]  Alexey Kondrashov also worked in the field of protein evolution.[11] Kondrashov states that amino acid composition of proteins varies between taxa, so it can evolve. For example, the organism that has more G+C base pairs in the genome will have more amino acids encoded by G+C rich codons. To support this hypothesis Kondrahov et al. compared sets of orthologous proteins from 15 taxa, which represent three domains of life. The amino acids with reducing frequencies was probably among the first incorporated into the genetic codes. Also, all amino acids except Ser, which have an increase in frequency, were probably recruited late. This process also continues to go today./nOn August 22, 2012, Kondrashov wrote an article in Nature, describing a link between older fathers and a rise in disorders such as autism. The paper attracted a lot of public attention and Kondrashov was interviewed by The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Economist and several television networks.[12] The research investigated the number of spontaneous (de novo) mutations in humans. It showed that a 40-year-old father transmits nearly two and a half times more mutations to his offspring than a 20-year-old father. As the example, a 20-year-old father can transmit nearly 25 random mutations to the offspring. The number of transmitted mutations is rising on two mutations for every more year. So, a 40-year-old father can transmit nearly 65 mutations to the offspring. The exact reason for it is not well understood, but the collecting of sperm of young men and freezing it for the future can be a clever choice.[13] The brain is usually more affected by these mutations, because more genes are expressed in the brain than in any other organ.[14]", "33550544": "Jessica Ulrika Meir (IPA: /m\u026a\u0259r/; meer;[2] born (1977-07-01)July 1, 1977) is an American NASA astronaut, marine biologist, and physiologist. She was previously an assistant professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, following postdoctoral research in comparative physiology at the University of British Columbia.[3][4] She has studied the diving physiology and behavior of emperor penguins in Antarctica,[5] and the physiology of bar-headed geese, which are able to migrate over the Himalayas.[6] In September 2002, Meir served as an aquanaut on the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations 4 (NEEMO 4) crew.[7] In 2013, she was selected by NASA to Astronaut Group 21. In 2016, Meir participated in ESA CAVES, a  training course in which international astronauts train in a space-analogue cave environment.[8] Meir launched on September 25, 2019, to the ISS onboard Soyuz MS-15, where she served as a flight Engineer during Expedition 61 and 62.[9] On October 18, 2019, Meir and Christina Koch were the first women to participate in an all-female spacewalk./nMeir was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020.[10]/nMeir was born in Caribou, Maine, to Josef H Meir, an Israeli of Iraqi-Jewish descent[11][12] and Ulla-Britt Meir from Sweden.[13]  Her father was born in Baghdad, Iraq in 1925. His family left in 1931 because of antisemitism, moving to British Mandatory Palestine. Studying medicine at the American University of Beirut when the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War broke out he returned to Israel and drove an ambulance. After the war he completed his medical studies at the University of Geneva.[11][12][2] Working as a physician in Sweden he met Ulla-Britt Karlsson, a nurse from V\u00e4ster\u00e5s who'd grown up as a Christian. The couple moved to the US so that Josef could take up a medical residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital. While there he was offered a job in Caribou where Meir was born. Her mother did not convert to Judaism but Meir identifies as culturally Jewish, attended synagogue while growing up and had a bat mitzvah.[2] [14]/nShe was inspired to venture into space after watching the Space Shuttle missions on television. Meir knew no one who worked for NASA or for the space program. She attributes her abiding dream of personally participating in space exploration to the love of nature she learned from her mother, and from her father's predilection for wandering and adventure. \"And it might have had something to do with the fact that the stars shone so brightly in rural Maine\", Meir added.[2]/nAt the age of 13, Meir attended a youth space camp at Purdue University.[15][16][17] During her undergraduate biology studies at Brown University,[18] she also spent a semester studying at Stockholm University in Sweden during her undergraduate years,[19] and ran a student experiment on a NASA reduced gravity aircraft \"vomit comet\" in her senior year.[2][16] Meir graduated from Brown in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology, magna cum laude.[20] In 2000, Meir graduated with a Master of Space Studies from the International Space University in Strasbourg, France.[21]/nMeir earned a Ph.D. in marine biology in 2009 from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography for research on the diving physiology of emperor penguins and northern elephant seals.[20][22][23] Meir performed field work at Penguin Ranch on McMurdo Sound in Antarctica to study the diving abilities of the emperor penguin while scuba diving alongside them under the ice.[24][23] She also studied elephant seals while they were diving in the Pacific Ocean off Northern California.[23]/nMeir did post-doctoral research at the University of British Columbia, raising bar-headed geese so their tolerance of high altitude and low oxygen levels during flight over the Himalayas could be studied in a controlled environment.[6][23] For the 2012 academic year she continued her research as an assistant professor of anesthesia at the Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital and then took a leave of absence to enter the astronaut corps.[25]/nAfter getting her master's degree, Meir worked from 2000 to 2003 for Lockheed Martin Space Operations as an experiment support scientist for the Human Research Facility at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas.[26][27] Meir coordinated and supported human space life science experiments that were performed by astronauts on Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) missions. These experiments included physiological studies (bone loss, muscle control/atrophy, lung function, etc.) to determine if any bodily processes were altered in the spaceflight environment. Meir guided these experiments through the necessary review cycles, developed procedures that the astronauts would use on-orbit, trained crew members, and provided ground support in the Mission Control Center while the astronauts were performing the experiments on the shuttle or ISS.[19]/nIn September 2002, Meir served as an aquanaut on the joint NASA-NOAA NEEMO 4 expedition (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations), an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, an undersea research laboratory four miles off shore from Key Largo. Meir and her crewmates spent five days saturation diving from the Aquarius habitat as a space analogue for working and training under extreme environmental conditions. The mission was delayed due to Hurricane Isadore, forcing National Undersea Research Center managers to shorten it to an underwater duration of five days. Then, three days into their underwater mission, the crew members were told that Tropical Storm Lili was headed in their direction and to prepare for an early departure from Aquarius. Fortunately, Lili degenerated to the point where it was no longer a threat, so the crew was able to remain the full five days.[7][28]/nAt the time of NEEMO 4, Meir was leaning toward pursuing a PhD in a field related to evolutionary biology and/or life in extreme environments (astrobiology). She was also fascinated by marine biology (which suited the NEEMO mission well), and hoped to coordinate a specific topic of study to combine these main interests.[19] She received her PhD in marine biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, studying diving physiology, in 2009.[26]/nIn 2009, Meir was a semi-finalist for selection to NASA Astronaut Group 20.[29] For the next selection group in June 2013, Meir was chosen as one of eight astronaut candidates for training in NASA Astronaut Group 21.[4] She completed training in July 2015.[30]/nIn 2016, she participated[31][32] in the ESA CAVES[8] mission[33][34] of the European Space Agency alongside Ricky Arnold, Sergei Korsakov, Aki Hoshide, Ye Guangfu and Pedro Duque./nDuring her time in the astronaut office, Meir has served as the capsule communicator for various missions. She was the lead capsule communicator for Expedition 47, the BEAM mission, and a HTV (Japanese Space Agency cargo vehicle) mission.[35]/nMeir is a member of the science advisory board of Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation.[36]/nIn April 2019 NASA announced that Meir had been assigned to the crew of International Space Station Expedition 61/62 as flight engineer, scheduled to launch aboard Soyuz MS-15 alongside Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and MBRSC astronaut Hazza Al Mansouri, who would fly a short duration mission and land with the crew of Soyuz MS-12 eight days after launch.[37]/nMeir, Skripochka and Al Mansouri launched aboard MS-15 on September 25, 2019, marking the final flight of the Soyuz-FG rocket and final launch from the Gagarin's Start launch pad, both of which were retired following launch of Soyuz MS-15. The crew successfully reached orbit and rendezvoused with the ISS only six hours later.[38] Soyuz MS-15 docked to the ISS at the very end of Expedition 60, meaning it marked an unusual period on the station where there were nine people aboard. The reason for this was to allow for Al Mansouri's flight, in which he became the first person from the United Arab Emirates to fly in space. Expedition 60 ended on October 3, 2019, when Al Mansouri, alongside Soyuz MS-12 crew members Aleksey Ovchinin and Nick Hague, undocked from the station and returned to Earth, returning the ISS to normal six-crew operations during Expedition 61.[39]/nDuring Expedition 61, Meir was scheduled to perform three spacewalks during this mission to help install new lithium-ion batteries on the Port-6 truss structure of the ISS, although this schedule was later changed.[40][41] On October 18, 2019, Meir performed her first spacewalk alongside her colleague Christina Koch, replacing a faulty Battery Charging Discharging Unit. The unit had unexpectedly failed to activate, preventing the station's newly installed lithium-ion batteries from providing additional power.[42] The three other scheduled spacewalks scheduled to install the new batteries had to be postponed in order to perform this spacewalk.[41]\nThe spacewalk lasted seven hours and 17 minutes, and was the first all-female spacewalk in history.[43][44][45] During the spacewalk US president Donald Trump called and spoke to the astronauts in recognition of the historical significance of this event, being corrected by Meir after mistakenly announcing the event as the first time a woman was outside the space station.[46]/nOn February 6, 2020, Koch, alongside Soyuz MS-13 crew members Aleksandr Skvortsov and Luca Parmitano, returned to Earth, following which Meir, Skripochka and Andrew Morgan transferred over to Expedition 62. Due to delays with NASA's Commercial Crew Program, most of this increment was spent as a crew of three. During the final eight days of the Expedition, the crew was joined by the three person crew of Soyuz MS-16, Russian cosmonauts Anatoli Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner joined by NASA astronaut Christopher Cassidy, who launched and docked to the station on April 9, 2020.[47] Although their time as a six-person crew was short, the expanded Expedition 62 crew made the most of their time together, conducting experiments on how muscles react to long duration spaceflight as part of NASA's Muscle tone in space (Myotones) experiment.[48] On April 13 Meir and Cassidy, both Maine natives, participated in a live conference with several students from around Maine;[49] the two, joined by Andrew Morgan, also participated in a segment of Some Good News, an internet show hosted by American actor John Krasinski to spread good news during the COVID-19 pandemic.[50]/nOn April 17, 2020, Meir, joined by Skripochka and Morgan, returned to Earth aboard Soyuz MS-15, wrapping up a 205-day spaceflight for Meir and Skripochka and returning Morgan from a 272-day flight. The Soyuz capsule touched down near the town of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, at 11:16am local time.[51] The departure of the three crew members signaled the start of Expedition 63, commanded by Cassidy, which would see the arrival of the SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission, the first crewed orbital spaceflight to launch from American soil since STS-135, the final flight of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.[52]/nMeir played flute, piccolo, and saxophone in her youth, and enjoys reading classical literature. She enjoys recreational cycling, hiking, running, skiing, soccer and scuba diving, and holds a private pilot's license.[26]/nApart from English and Russian (required for astronaut training), she also speaks Swedish.[35] Although Meir's nationality is American, due to also holding Swedish citizenship by virtue of her mother's country of birth, she is technically the first Swedish female citizenship-holder in space and the second Swedish citizen in space overall after ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang.[53][54]/nAstronauts are allowed to bring a number of personal items to the International Space Station, and two among Meir's choices were an Israeli flag and a pair of novelty socks with Stars of David and menorahs.[14][55] Most of Meir's relatives from her father's side reside in Israel.[2] Meir has visited Israel twice: the first time as a teenager with her parents and her brother, and the second time in 2016 for work as an astronaut where she gave a talk in Haifa, Israel, at the International Space University summer session.[2] Among other things, she also took pictures of Israel from space.[55]/nOn International Women's Day in 2023, Meir announced the recent birth of her first child, a girl, on her Instagram account.[56][57] Her partner and co-parent is Duke Brady, an artist and biologist who grew up in Hawaii.

After being educated by private tutors, he went to Paris for his high school degree before enrolling in the natural sciences faculty at the University of Paris[1] in 1885.[2] After a period of specialization at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, he obtained a doctorate of science from the Sorbonne in 1889. His thesis dealt with stem development in Selaginella species and was supervised by Gaston Bonnier. He married Maria Anastasescu in 1897. In 1888, he was named professor of botany at Ia\u0219i University, where he took over a course temporarily taught by Nicolae Leon. In 1890, he held a lecture at the university in which he advocated for evolutionist ideas and defended Darwinism. His students included Sava Athanasiu, Ioan Gh. Botez, Dimitrie C\u0103lug\u0103reanu, Constantin Mota\u0219 and Ion Th. Simionescu. In 1895, following the death of Dimitrie Br\u00e2ndz\u0103, he was transferred to the University of Bucharest, also as botany professor.[1]/nIn Bucharest, Vl\u0103descu taught plant morphology and classification until he reached the retirement age in 1936.[1] He headed the Botanical Institute from 1895 to 1936, was vice president of the Romanian Scientific Society from 1901 to 1936 and president of the Cultural League from 1897 to 1903.[2] He was dean of the science faculty from 1915 to 1919 and rector of the university from 1920 to 1923. In politics, he sat in both the Assembly of Deputies and the Senate.[1] While in Ia\u0219i, he belonged to George Panu's Radical Party, shifting to the Conservative Party once he reached Bucharest. He then joined the Conservative-Democratic Party and, finally, the People's Party.[2] From December 1904 to October 1906, he was Religious Affairs and Public Instruction Minister under Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino; from December 1921 to January 1922, he served as Domains Minister under Take Ionescu.[3] While a Conservative deputy for his native Muscel area from 1901 to 1909, he initiated legislation for a rural credit bank called Casa Rural\u0103.[2]/nHis articles appeared in various publications, and he submitted several botanical entries to Enciclopedia rom\u00e2n\u0103 in which he espoused Darwinist ideas.[1]\nThe standard author abbreviation Vl\u0103descu is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.[4]", "31387860": "Werner Georg Kollath (11 June 1892 \u2013 19 November 1970) was a German bacteriologist, hygienist and food scientist. He is considered a pioneer of whole foods./nWerner Kollath was born on 11 June 1892 in Gollnow, the son of the practical physician Dr. George Kollath. After attending school in Gollnow and Stettin, completing his abitur in autumn 1911, he studied medicine in Leipzig, Freiburg, Berlin and Kiel. During World War I, for which he registered as a volunteer, he served as a field physician./nAfter the war he continued his studies in Marburg. He gained his doctorate there in 1920, and received his licence to work as a medical doctor. In 1923, he became assistant to Richard Pfeiffer at the Hygiene Institute of the University of Breslau. In 1926, he completed his habilitation with a thesis on \"Vitamin Substance or Vitamin Effect in Influenza Bacteria\" (German: Vitaminsubstanz oder Vitaminwirkung bei Influenzabakterien). In 1932, he was appointed special professor of the University of Breslau, and in 1933-1934, was appointed department head for the  subject Hygiene./nIn 1933, he joined the Nazi Party. He was also a SS-F\u00f6rdermitglied and from October 1933 was a member of the National Socialist Teachers League (German: Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (NSLB)), the National Socialist German University Lecturers League (German: Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund), the National Socialist People's Welfare (German: Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt (NSV)), and the State Air Protection Corps (German: Reichsluftschutzbund). This information appears on Kollath's Nazi Party membership card.[1]/nIn 1935 he was appointed as Professor of Hygiene and Bacteriology at the University of Rostock and was also Director of the Provincial Health Office (German: Landesgesundheitsamt).[1] He held lectures, among other subjects, on racial hygiene, and advocated the establishment of a department for this subject.[2]/nIn 1937, he was for one year Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and published a textbook on hygiene entitled Grundlagen, Methoden und Ziele der Hygiene (Principles, Methods and Goals of Health). Kollath's hygiene textbook was approved by the authorities in Nazi Germany, probably because of the passages on eugenics. The state organisation for the promotion of German literature (German: Reichsstelle zur F\u00f6rderung des deutschen Schrifttums) chose the book as one of the 100 best German books of the year 1936/37.[3] The book includes the statement \"The difficulties in the hygienic area has so far been that adequate legislation, for instance the elimination of inferior (people) from reproduction, has failed in the past.\" (German: Die Schwierigkeiten auf hygienischem Gebiet lagen bisher darin, dass eine ausreichende Gesetzgebung, die z.\u00a0B. die Ausschaltung Minderwertiger von der Fortpflanzung erm\u00f6glichte, in der Vergangenheit nicht bestanden hat.)[4] His support for the Nazi laws is also confirmed by his statement \"Eine h\u00f6here und edlere Form der Humanit\u00e4t ist erst durch die nationalsozialistische Gesetzgebung in Deutschland eingef\u00fchrt durch die Sterilisationsgesetze\u201c[5] (Translation: \"A higher and nobler form of humanity is introduced by the Nazi legislation in Germany by the sterilization laws\")/nIn 1942, Kollath published his most important book, Die Ordnung unserer Nahrung. The publication date indicates the importance of the book to the Nazi regime for the war.[6] In the book, Kollath used the word Vollwertkost, which can be literally translated as full value food, but for which the phrase whole foods is used.[7] Vollwertkost meant a diet that contains everything an organism needs for its preservation and the conservation of the species. For the food concept itself, he resorted mainly to Maximilian Bircher-Benner's publications.  Kollath classified all foods into six value levels. The lower the degree (of processing), the higher was the food's value. Plants were always rated higher than animals, and raw food higher than cooked food.[7] Kollath also distinguished between unprocessed or slightly processed food, which he regarded as living food, and highly processed food, which he regarded as dead food (German: tote Nahrung).[8]/nKollath's commitment to Nazism continued until the spring of 1945. Before the capitulation, he took part in exercises of the Volkssturm./nBecause of the order of the president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern for cleansing the administration on 30 August 1945, Kollath was dismissed because of his party affiliation.[9]  Kollath appealed against his dismissal with the assertion that he was not an active fascist, but had represented contrary opinions. He kept a leading position in the commission until 1946. Rostock was part of the Soviet occupation zone. Kollath was certified by the SED that he was \"only a nominal member of the Nazi Party\", and that he had applied for admission to the KPD in December 1945. He was also included as a party candidate in the SED, which is mistakenly referred to as denazification.[10] In 1947, he was dismissed as director of the provincial health office. In March 1947, Kollath secretly left the Soviet occupation zone in a pre-arranged flight, and moved to Hanover, where he worked as a food chemist and consultant for the Keksfabrikanten Bahlsen, for whom he had tested flyer drop food during World War II.[11]/nIn 1948, he published the second edition of his hygiene textbook. In this edition, he changed 'racial hygiene' to 'social hygiene', 'Goebbels' to 'Goethe', and deleted passages dealing with Hitler, selection, inheritance and forced sterilisation.[12] In 1948, he received his denazification certificate in category IV, which was changed to category V after his successful appeal, and researched from September 1948 to February 1949 at the Pathological Institute in Stockholm./nIn 1950, he published the book Der Vollwert der Nahrung und seine Bedeutung f\u00fcr Wachstum und Zellersatz (The full value of nutrition and its importance for growth and cell replacement), in which he wrote about a 'full value theory' (German: Vollwertlehre). He continued after 1950 to work on the popularising of whole foods, and worked on the first Gesundheitsbrockhaus, a health encyclopaedia./nSince 1951, the so-called \"Kollath-breakfast\" (cereal mixture) has been sold in Reformhaus shops./nDuring a private trip through Chile, he was offered a research position at the Medical Faculty of Hygiene in Santiago de Chile which he turned down.\nIn April 1952, he was retired retroactively from April 1951, allegedly on the basis of an official medical report, and so had an income again. From 1952 to 1956, he carried out studies on animals at the University of Munich to prove his hypotheses on mesotrophy by inadequate diet.[13] Kollath is credited with the introduction of the term 'probiotics'.[14] In 1953, he wrote about probiotics as being in contrast to harmful antibiotics,[15] and defined 'Probiotika' as being \"active substances that are essential for a healthy development of life\".[14]/nKollath's work on nutrition was recognised in the 1950s and 1960s by the Internationale Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Nahrungs- und Vitalstoff-Forschung (IVG), the World Union for Protection of Life, and the Arbeitskreis Gesundheitskunde, which was established in 1964, and also people practising alternative medicine. The 17th edition of his book \"Die Ordnung unserer Nahrung\" was published in 2005, and is regarded as a basis for whole food nutrition./nKollath invented a method for preserving grains and some legumes without chemicals or overheating. The method is named after him, the Kollath method (German: collatieren).[16]/nKollath wrote 326 scientific publications including 28 books.

Among his students were Nikolay Timofeeff-Ressovsky, Vladimir Pavlovich Efroimson, A.S. Serebrovsky, and Nikolay Dubinin. Along with his students, he demonstrated the fine structure of genes, and examined the structure of the cell and pioneered the idea of a cytoskeleton. His career was cut short in Stalinist Russia after being falsely accused of supporting scientific racism. He died unexpectedly following government persecution and there are allegations that he was executed./nKoltsov was born in a well-to do family, his father was an accountant in a fur company, and graduated from Moscow University in 1894 and was a professor there (1895\u20131911). He established and directed the Institute of Experimental Biology in the middle of 1917, just before the October Revolution. He was a member of the Agricultural Academy (VASKhNIL). He was against the Tsarist regime but after the revolution, he opposed several policies of the new rule. In 1911 he left Moscow University and moved to the Shanyavsky Moscow City People's University. In 1920, Koltsov was arrested as a member of the non-existent \"anti-Soviet Tactical Center\" invented by the VCheKa. Prosecutor Nikolai Krylenko demanded the death sentence for Koltsov (67 of around 1000 arrested people were executed).[2] However, after a personal appeal to Vladimir Lenin by Maxim Gorky Koltsov was released and was restored to his position as the head of the Koltsov Institute of Experimental Biology.[3]/nThe politics of the Soviet Union made the idea of genes, particles that decided outcomes in life, as antithetical to the concept of individual freedom. Marxist ideologues also clubbed geneticists with eugenicists, racists, and fascists while also preferring ideas from Lamarckism as promoted by Trofim Lysenko./nIn 1937 and 1939, the supporters of Lysenko published a series of propaganda articles against Nikolai Koltsov and Nikolai Vavilov. They wrote: \"The Institute of Genetics of the Academy of Sciences not only did not criticize Professor Koltsov's fascistic nonsense, but even did not dissociate itself from his \"theories\" which support the racial theories of fascists\".[2] His death in 1940 was claimed to have been due to a stroke. However, \"the biochemist Ilya Zbarsky revealed that the unexpected death of Koltsov was a result of his poisoning by the NKVD\", the secret police of the Soviet Union.[4] On the same day his wife, the scientist Maria Sadovnikova Koltsova, committed suicide.[2][5]/nNikolai Koltsov worked on cytology and vertebrate anatomy. In 1903 Koltsov proposed that the shape of cells was determined by a network of tubules forming a skeleton[6] which was later termed as the cytoskeleton[citation needed]. He saw the role of gel-sol transitions in the cytoplasm as key mechanisms for the cell structure.[7] In 1927 Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a \"giant hereditary molecule\" which would be made up of \"two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template\".[3] Koltsov used the expression omnis molecula ex molecula (every molecule comes from another molecule) based on Virchow's idea that all cells came from other cells. These ideas were confirmed to have been accurate in 1953 when James D. Watson and Francis Crick described the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick had apparently not heard of Koltsov. US geneticist Richard Goldschmidt wrote about him: \"There was the brilliant Nikolai Koltsov, probably the best Russian zoologist of the last generation, an enviable, unbelievably cultured, clear-thinking scholar, admired by everybody who knew him\".[3] He also suggested that electrical forces were involved in intracellular movement.

Her research considers how Gram-positive bacteria cause disease, with a particular focus on the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes./nSriskandan was born in 1964 in Yorkshire. Her father, Sri Lankan-born bridge designer Kanagaratnam Sriskandan (1930-2010), served as Britain's Chief Highway Engineer.[1] As a child, Sriskandan was interested in physics and space science.[2] Sriskandan attended Bromley High School in Greater London from 1973 to 1982. Her brother studied medicine, and this inspired her to become a physician too. Sriskandan completed her undergraduate degree in medicine at Clare College, Cambridge and St Bartholomew's Hospital.[3] She completed her doctoral research on Streptococcus pyogenes at Imperial College London.[4] She specialised in infectious diseases and completed a Medical Research Council clinical fellowship.[3] In 2001 Sriskandan was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.[5]/nEvery year, 616 million cases of pharyngitis are caused by the bacteria streptococcus pyogenes.

There is a continuity in this way between his work on the immune system, for which he won the Nobel Prize, and his later work in neuroscience and in philosophy of mind./nGerald Edelman was born in 1929[3] in Ozone Park, Queens, New York, to Jewish parents, physician Edward Edelman, and Anna (n\u00e9e Freedman) Edelman, who worked in the insurance industry.[4] He studied violin for years, but eventually realized that he did not have the inner drive needed to pursue a career as a concert violinist, and decided to go into medical research instead.[5] He attended public schools in New York, graduating from John Adams High School,[6] and going on to college in Pennsylvania where he graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. from Ursinus College in 1950 and received an M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1954.[4]/nAfter a year at the Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics, Edelman became a resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital; he then practiced medicine in France while serving with US Army Medical Corps.[4] In 1957, Edelman joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research as a graduate fellow, working in the laboratory of Henry Kunkel and receiving a Ph.D. in 1960.[4] The institute made him the assistant (later associate) dean of graduate studies; he became a professor at the school in 1966.[4] In 1992, he moved to California and became a professor of neurobiology at The Scripps Research Institute.[7]/nAfter his Nobel prize award, Edelman began research into the regulation of primary cellular processes, particularly the control of cell growth and the development of multi-celled organisms, focusing on cell-to-cell interactions in early embryonic development and in the formation and function of the nervous system. These studies led to the discovery of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which guide the fundamental processes that help an animal achieve its shape and form, and by which nervous systems are built. One of the most significant discoveries made in this research is that the precursor gene for the neural cell adhesion molecule gave rise in evolution to the entire molecular system of adaptive immunity.[8]/nFor his efforts, Edelman was an elected member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1968) and the American Philosophical Society (1977).[9][10]/nWhile in Paris serving in the Army, Edelman read a book that sparked his interest in antibodies.[11] He decided that, since the book said so little about antibodies, he would investigate them further upon returning to the United States, which led him to study physical chemistry for his 1960 Ph.D.[11] Research by Edelman and his colleagues and Rodney Robert Porter in the early 1960s produced fundamental breakthroughs in the understanding of the antibody's chemical structure, opening a door for further study.[12] For this work, Edelman and Porter shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1972.[1]/nIn its Nobel Prize press release in 1972, the Karolinska Institutet lauded Edelman and Porter's work as a major breakthrough:/nThe impact of Edelman's and Porter's discoveries is explained by the fact that they provided a clear picture of the structure and mode of action of a group of biologically particularly important substances. By this they laid a firm foundation for truly rational research, something that was previously largely lacking in immunology. Their discoveries represent clearly a break-through that immediately incited a fervent research activity the whole world over, in all fields of immunological science, yielding results of practical value for clinical diagnostics and therapy.[13]/nEdelman's early research on the structure of antibody proteins revealed that disulfide bonds link together the protein subunits.[2] The protein subunits of antibodies are of two types, the larger heavy chains and the smaller light chains. Two light and two heavy chains are linked together by disulfide bonds to form a functional antibody./nUsing experimental data from his own research and the work of others, Edelman developed molecular models of antibody proteins.[14] A key feature of these models included the idea that the antigen binding domains of antibodies (Fab) include amino acids from both the light and heavy protein subunits. The inter-chain disulfide bonds help bring together the two parts of the antigen binding domain./nEdelman and his colleagues used cyanogen bromide and proteases to fragment the antibody protein subunits into smaller pieces that could be analyzed for determination of their amino acid sequence.[15][16] At the time when the first complete antibody sequence was determined (1969)[17] it was the largest complete protein sequence that had ever been determined. The availability of amino acid sequences of antibody proteins allowed recognition of the fact that the body can produce many different antibody proteins with similar antibody constant regions and divergent antibody variable regions./nTopobiology is Edelman's theory which asserts that morphogenesis is driven by differential adhesive interactions among heterogeneous cell populations and it explains how a single cell can give rise to a complex multi-cellular organism. As proposed by Edelman in 1988, topobiology is the process that sculpts and maintains differentiated tissues and is acquired by the energetically favored segregation of cells through heterologous cellular interactions./nIn his later career, Edelman was noted for his theory of consciousness, documented in a trilogy of technical books and in several subsequent books written for a general audience, including Bright Air, Brilliant Fire (1992),[18][19] A Universe of Consciousness (2001, with Giulio Tononi), Wider than the Sky (2004) and Second Nature: Brain Science and Human Knowledge (2007)./nIn Second Nature Edelman defines human consciousness as:/nThe first of Edelman's technical books, The Mindful Brain (1978),[20] develops his theory of Neural Darwinism, which is built around the idea of plasticity in the neural network in response to the environment. The second book, Topobiology (1988),[21] proposes a theory of how the original neuronal network of a newborn's brain is established during development of the embryo. The Remembered Present (1990)[22] contains an extended exposition of his theory of consciousness./nIn his books, Edelman proposed a biological theory of consciousness, based on his studies of the immune system. He explicitly roots his theory within Charles Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection, citing the key tenets of Darwin's population theory, which postulates that individual variation within species provides the basis for the natural selection that eventually leads to the evolution of new species.[23] He explicitly rejected dualism and also dismissed newer hypotheses such as the so-called 'computational' model of consciousness, which liken the brain's functions to the operations of a computer. Edelman argued that mind and consciousness are purely biological phenomena, arising from complex cellular processes within the brain, and that the development of consciousness and intelligence can be explained by Darwinian theory./nEdelman's theory seeks to explain consciousness in terms of the morphology of the brain. A brain comprises a massive population of neurons (approx. 100 billion cells) each with an enormous number of synaptic connections to other neurons. During development, the subset of connections that survive the initial phases of growth and development will make approximately 100 trillion connections with each other. A sample of brain tissue the size of a match head contains about a billion connections, and if we consider how these neuronal connections might be variously combined, the number of possible permutations becomes hyper-astronomical \u2013 in the order of ten followed by millions of zeros.[24] The young brain contains many more neural connections than will ultimately survive to maturity, and Edelman argued that this redundant capacity is needed because neurons are the only cells in the body that cannot be renewed and because only those networks best adapted to their ultimate purpose will be selected as they organize into neuronal groups./nEdelman's theory of neuronal group selection, also known as 'Neural Darwinism', has three basic tenets\u2014Developmental Selection, Experiential Selection and Reentry./nEdelman and Gally were the first to point out the pervasiveness of degeneracy in biological systems and the fundamental role that degeneracy plays in facilitating evolution.[27]/nEdelman founded and directed The Neurosciences Institute, a nonprofit research center in San Diego that between 1993 and 2012 studied the biological bases of higher brain function in humans. He served on the scientific board of the World Knowledge Dialogue project.[28]/nEdelman was a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.[29]/nEdelman married Maxine M. Morrison in 1950.[4] They have two sons, Eric, a visual artist in New York City, and David, an adjunct professor of neuroscience at University of San Diego. Their daughter, Judith Edelman, is a bluegrass musician,[30] recording artist, and writer. Some observers[who?] have noted that a character in Richard Powers' The Echo Maker may be a nod at Edelman./nLater in his life, he had prostate cancer and Parkinson's disease.[31] Edelman died on May 17, 2014, in La Jolla, California, aged 84.[3][32][33]", "66154730": "Stephen H.

Davenport was exceedingly proud of his ancestry, claiming in 1942 that he had been an American \"for over three hundred years\" because he was \"composed of elements that were brought to this country during the 17th century.\"[1] His father had eleven children by two wives, and Charles grew up with his family on Garden Place in Brooklyn Heights.[2] His mother's strong beliefs tended to rub off onto Charles and he followed the example of his mother. During the summer months, Charles and his family spent their time on a family farm near Stamford.[2]/nDue to Davenport's father's strong belief in Protestantism, as a young boy Charles was tutored at home. This came about in order for Charles to learn the values of hard work and education. When he was not studying, Charles worked as a janitor and errand boy for his father's business.[3] His father had a significant influence on his early career, as he encouraged Charles to become an engineer.[4] However, this was not his primary interest, and after working for a few years to save up money, Charles enrolled in Harvard College to pursue his genuine interest of becoming a scientist. He graduated with a Bachelor's after two years, and earned a Ph.D in biology in 1892.[4] He married Gertrude Crotty, a zoology graduate of Harvard with whom he would later collaborate closely, in 1894. He had two daughters with Gertrude, Millia Crotty Davenport and Jane Davenport Harris di Tomasi.[5]/nDavenport's first faculty position was as a professor of zoology at Harvard, where he became one of the most prominent American biologists of his time, pioneering new quantitative standards of taxonomy. Davenport had a tremendous respect for the biometric approach to heredity pioneered by English eugenicists Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, whom he met in London, and was involved in Pearson's journal, Biometrika.[3] However, after the re-discovery of Gregor Mendel's laws of heredity, he moved on to become a prominent supporter of Mendelian inheritance.[4]/nFrom 1899 to 1904 Davenport taught at the University of Chicago, where he was also curator of the university's Zoological Museum from 1901 to 1904.[6] In 1903, he helped to found the American Breeders' Association, which later became the American Genetic Association.[7]/nIn 1904,[3] Davenport became director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.[8] He founded the Eugenics Record Office there in 1910, with a grant from railroad heiress Mary Averell Harriman, whose daughter Mary Harriman Rumsey had worked with Davenport at Cold Spring Harbor while she was a student at Barnard College. During his time at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Davenport began a series of investigations into aspects of the inheritance of human personality and mental traits, and over the years he generated hundreds of papers and several books on the genetics of alcoholism, pellagra (later shown to be due to a vitamin deficiency), criminality, feeblemindedness, tendency to seafaring, bad temper, intelligence, manic depression, and the biological effects of race crossing.[3] Davenport taught eugenics courses to many people at the Laboratory, including the Massachusetts suffragist Claiborne Catlin Elliman.[9] His 1911 book, Heredity in Relation to Eugenics, was used as a college textbook for many years. During Davenport's tenure at Cold Spring Harbor, several reorganizations took place there. In 1918 the Carnegie Institution of Washington took over funding of the ERO with an additional handsome endowment from Mary Harriman.[3]/nDavenport was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1907,[10] and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1912. In 1921 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.[11]/nDavenport's research was guided by the racism and classism of his time, which he bought into wholeheartedly. Although he was one of the first scientists to recognize polygenic inheritance (the influence of many genes on a single trait), he continued to employ simple Mendelian models when convenient for making racist and classist claims.[4] His work drew more and more criticism over time. Eventually, only his most ardent admirers regarded his work as truly scientific.[3]/nDavenport was particularly interested in race-mixing, which he saw both as a phenomenon that could shed light on the workings of human heredity and as a threat to society. He and his assistants turned repeatedly to Jamaica as a laboratory for studying the heredity of physiological and intellectual characteristics due to its large mixed-race population.[12][13] Davenport drew on the Mendelian concept of dihybrid crossing\u2014according to which characteristics segregate during reproduction and therefore recombine in different ways in the offspring\u2014to argue that \"a hybridized people\" (a category which, for Davenport, included the offspring of unions between partners from different parts of Europe as well as the offspring of unions between partners from different continents) were \"a badly put together people and a dissatisfied, restless, ineffective people.\"[14][15]/nDavenport founded the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations (IFEO) in 1925, with Eugen Fischer as chairman of the Commission on Bastardization and Miscegenation (1927). Davenport aspired to found a World Institute for Miscegenations, and \"was working on a 'world map' of the 'mixed-race areas,[16] which he introduced for the first time at a meeting of the IFEO in Munich in 1928.\"[17]/nTogether with his assistant Morris Steggerda, Davenport attempted to develop a comprehensive quantitative approach to human miscegenation. The results of their research was presented in the book Race Crossing in Jamaica (1929), which attempted to provide statistical evidence for biological and cultural degradation following interbreeding between white and black populations.[13] Today it is considered a work of scientific racism, and was criticized in its time for drawing conclusions which stretched far beyond (and sometimes counter to) the data it presented.[18] Particularly caustic was the review of the book published by Karl Pearson at Nature, where he considered that \"the only thing that is apparent in the whole of this lengthy treatise is that the samples are too small and drawn from too heterogeneous a population to provide any trustworthy conclusions at all\".[19]/nAnother way Charles Davenport's work manifested in the public sphere is regarding the topic of immigration. He believed that race determined behavior, and that many mental and behavioral traits were hereditary.[2] He drew these conclusions by studying family pedigrees, and was criticized by some of his peers for making unfounded conclusions.[2] Regardless, Davenport believed that the biological differences between the races justified a strict immigration policy, and that people of races deemed \u201cundesirable\u201d should not be allowed into the country.[20] His support of Mendelian genetics fueled this belief, as he believed allowing certain groups of people to enter the country would negatively impact the nation's genetic pool. Domestically, he also supported the prevention of \"negative eugenics\" through sterilization and sexual segregation of people who were considered genetically inferior. Sharing the racist views of many scientists during this time, those that Davenport considered to be genetically inferior included Black people and Southeastern Europeans.[2]/nIn addition to supporting these beliefs through his scientific work, he was actively involved in lobbying members of Congress. Charles Davenport spoke regularly with Congressman Albert Johnson, who was a cosponsor of the Immigration Act of 1924, and encouraged him to restrict immigration in that legislation. Davenport was not alone in this effort to influence policy, as Harry Laughlin, the superintendent of the Eugenics Record Office, appeared before Congress on multiple occasions to promote strict immigration laws and the belief that immigration was a \"biological problem\".[20] In all, Davenport\u2019s efforts served to provide scientific justification to social policies he supported, and immigration was one way this manifested in the beginning of the 20th century./nAfter Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, Davenport maintained connections with various Nazi institutions and publications, both before and during World War II. He held editorial positions at two influential German journals, both of which were founded in 1935, and in 1939 he wrote a contribution to the Festschrift for Otto Reche, who became an important figure in the plan to \"remove\" those populations considered \"inferior\" in eastern Germany.[21] In a 1938 Letter to the Editor of Life magazine, he included both Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Goebbels as examples of crippled statesmen who, motivated by their physical defects, have \"led revolutions and aspired to dictatorships while burdening their country with heavy taxes and reducing its finances to chaos.\"[22]/nAlthough many other scientists had stopped supporting eugenics due to the rise of Nazism in Germany, Charles Davenport remained a fervent supporter until the end of his life. Six years after he retired in 1934, Davenport held firm to these beliefs even after the Carnegie Institute pulled funding from the eugenics program at Cold Spring Harbor in 1940.[4] While Charles Davenport is remembered primarily for his role in the eugenics movement, he also had a significant influence in increasing funding for genetics research. His success in organizing the financial support for scientific endeavors fueled his success throughout his career, while also allowing for the study of other scientists.[20] Indeed, Cold Spring Harbor saw many prominent geneticists go through its doors while he was its director. He died of pneumonia in 1944 at the age of 77. He is buried in Laurel Hollow, New York./nAs quoted in the National Academy of Sciences' \"Biographical Memoir of Charles Benedict Davenport\" by Oscar Riddle, Davenport's Eugenics creed was as follows:[23]", "2257142": "Major-General Sir David Bruce KCB FRS FRCP FRSE[1] (29 May 1855 \u2013 27 November 1931) was a Scottish pathologist and microbiologist who made some of the key contributions in tropical medicine.[2] In 1887, he discovered a bacterium, now called Brucella, that caused what was known as Malta fever. In 1894, he discovered a protozoan parasite, named Trypanosoma brucei, as the causative pathogen of nagana (animal trypanosomiasis)./nWorking in the Army Medical Services and the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bruce's major scientific collaborator was his microbiologist wife Mary Elizabeth Bruce (n\u00e9e Steele), with whom he published around thirty technical papers out of his 172 papers.[3] In 1886, he was chairman of the Malta Fever Commission that investigated the deadly disease, by which he identified a specific bacterium as the cause. Later, with his wife, he investigated an outbreak of animal disease called nagana in Zululand and discovered the protozoan parasite responsible for it. He led the second and third Sleeping Sickness Commission organised by the Royal Society that investigated an epidemic of human sleeping sickness in Uganda, where he established that tsetse fly was the carrier (vector) of these human and animal diseases./nThe bacterium, Brucella, and the disease it caused, brucellosis, along with the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, are named in his honour./nBruce was born in Melbourne, Colony of Victoria, to Scottish parents, engineer David Bruce (from Airth) and his wife Jane Russell Hamilton (from Stirling), who had emigrated to Australia in the gold rush of 1850. He was an only child. He returned with his family to Scotland at the age of five. They lived at 1 Victoria Square in Stirling. He was educated at Stirling High School[4] and in 1869 began an apprenticeship in Manchester. However, a bout of pneumonia forced him to abandon this and re-assess his career. He then decided to study zoology but later changed to medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1876.[5] He graduated in 1881.[6]/nAfter a brief period as a general practitioner in Reigate, Surrey (1881\u201383), where he met and married his wife Mary, he entered the Army Medical School in Hampshire at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. He passed the military examination in 1883 and joined the Army Medical Services (in which he served until 1919).[7] For his first post he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1884 and was stationed in Valletta, Malta.[8]/nBruce was appointed assistant professor of pathology at the Army Medical School in Netley in 1889, and served there for five years.[6] He returned to military field service in 1894 and was posted to Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa. He was assigned to investigate the case of cattle and horse sickness (called nagana) in Zululand. On 27 October 1894, he and his wife (Mary Elizabeth) moved to Ubombo Hill, where the disease was most prevalent.[9] When the Second Boer War broke out in 1899, accompanied by his wife, he ran the field hospital during the Siege of Ladysmith (2 November 1899 until 28 February 1900). For his service during the war he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1899, Bruce was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. In 1900, he joined the army commission investigating dysentery in military camps, at the same time working for the Royal Society's Sleeping Sickness Commission.[7]/nBruce served as a member of the Army Medical Service Advisory Board from 1902 to 1911. In 1914 he became Commander of the Royal Army Medical College at Millbank, London, the position he held until his retirement as a Major-General in 1919.[10] He was immediately appointed chairman of the governing body of the Lister Institute. During his career he published more than ninety-seven technical articles, of which about thirty were co-authored by his wife.[6]/nHe died four days after his wife in 1931, during her memorial service. Both were cremated in London and their ashes are buried together in Valley Cemetery in Stirling, close to Stirling Castle, beneath a simple stone cross on the east side of the main north\u2013south path, near the southern roundel. They had no children.[3]/nAt the time of Bruce's service in Malta, British soldiers suffered an outbreak of what was called the Malta fever. The disease caused undulant fever in man and of abortion in goats. It is transmitted by goat milk. In 1886, Bruce led the Malta Fever Commission that investigated the epidemic.[11] Between 1886 and 1887, he studied five patients having Malta fever who died of the disease. From the spleen of corpses, he recovered a bacterium which he referred to as Micrococcus, which he described:/nWhen a minute portion taken from one of these [culture] colonies is placed in a drop of sterilized water and examined under a high power [of microscope], innumerable small micrococci are seen. They are very active, and dance about\u2014as a rule singly, sometimes in pairs, rarely in short chains.[12]/nBruce's assistant, Surgeon Captain Matthew Louis Hughes named the disease \"undulant fever\" and the bacterium, Micrococcus melitensis. The source of the infection was not clear, Hughes believing it to come from soil and the bacterium inhaled from the air.[13] Bruce reported the discovery in The Practitioner in 1887 with the conclusion:/nI think it will appear to be sufficiently proved: (a) that there exists in the spleen of cases of Malta fever a definite micro-organism; and (b) that this micro-organism can be cultivated outside the human body. On the latter point I may remark that I have already cultivated four successive generations. It now remains to be seen what effect, if any, this micro-organism has on healthy animals; what are the conditions of temperature, &c., under which it flourishes; where it is to be found; how it gains entrance to its human host; and many other points. All of these will take a long time to investigate. I have therefore published this preliminary note in order to draw the attention of other workers to what seems to me to be an attractive field.[12]/nHe was correct in his prediction that it was only in 1905 goat milk was established as the source of the infection. The discovery that the disease was transmitted from goat milk was generally attributed to Bruce himself. But an analysis of historical record in 2005 revealed that Themistocles Zammit, one of the members of the commission, was the one who experimentally demonstrated the origin of the bacterium from goat milk.[14]/nThe genus Micrococcus was changed to Brucella in honour of Bruce and is accepted as a valid name.[15][16] Accordingly, the disease has been renamed brucellosis.[17][18]/nWhen Bruce was transferred to South Africa, he was sent to Zululand to investigate the outbreak of animal disease which the natives called nagana, and the Europeans, the fly disease. In 1894, he and his wife found that the disease was prevalent among cattle, donkey, horses and dogs.[9][19] They collected blood samples from such infected animals, and found parasites which Bruce identified correctly as a type of \"Haematozoon\" (attributed to protozoans that are blood parasites), as he described in his report in 1895:/nAt this point I think it will be convenient to give a definite description of the parasite discovered by me in the blood of animals affected by this disease, and to bring forward my reasons for considering it to be the proximate exciting cause of the disease. For the present I shall call it the Haematozoon or Blood Parasite of Fly disease, although in all probability on further knowledge it will be found to be identical with the haematozoon of Surra, which is called Trypanosoma Evansi or at least a species belonging to that genus...[20]/nHe also made accurate identification characters of the parasite as unique organisms:/n[Under a microscope] can be seen transparent elongated bodies in active movement, wriggling about like tiny snakes and swimming from corpuscle to corpuscle, which they seem to seize upon and worry. They appear to be about a quarter of the diameter of a Red Blood Corpuscle in thickness, and 2 or 3 times the diameter of a corpuscle in length. They are pointed or somewhat blunt at one end, and the other extremity is seen to be prolonged into a very fine lash, which is in constant whip-like motion. Running along the cylindrical body between the two extremities can be seen a transparent delicate longitudinal membrane or fin [later named undulating membrane] which is also constantly in wave-like motion... These parasites evidently belong to a very low form of animal life, namely the infusoria, and simply consist of a small mass of protoplasm surrounded by a limiting membrane, and without any differentiation of structure, except in so far as the membrane is prolonged to form the longitudinal fin and flagellum.[20]/nHe performed several experiments on different animals as to how the parasite was transmitted. He found that the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans), which was common in the region, could carry the live parasites from feeding on blood of the animals. He established that \"the Tsetse Fly plays a most important part in the propagation of the disease\", but was unable show that the flies could actually transmit the disease.[19] He explained:/nI have not been able exactly to prove the part which the Tsetse Fly plays in the causation or production of the Fly Disease, I think it well to begin with a consideration of the Fly itself, not only on account of its historical value, but also because I am at present of opinion that the Tsetse Fly does play some part, and perhaps no inconsiderable part, in the propagation of the disease. Be it at once stated that I have not the slightest belief in the notion popularly prevalent up to the present that the Fly causes the disease by the injection of a poison elaborated by itself, after the manner of the leech, which injects a fluid to prevent the coagulation of the blood, or the snake for the purpose of procuring its prey or for defence, but that at most the Tsetse acts as a carrier of a living virus, an infinitely small parasite, from one animal to another, which entering into the blood stream of the animal bitten or pricked, there propagates and so gives rise to the disease.[20]/nHenry George Plimmer and John Rose Bradford gave the full description of the new parasite in 1899 as Trypanosoma brucei, the name after the discoverer.[21]/nThere was an outbreak of sleeping sickness in Uganda from 1900.[22] By 1901, it became severe with death toll estimated to about 20,000.[23] More than 250,000 people died in the epidemic that lasted for two decades.[22] The disease commonly popularised as \"negro lethargy\"[24][25] was not known to be related to the fly disease.[26] At the time, the human disease was believed to be either bacterial infection or helminth infection.[27]/nThe Royal Society constituted a three-member Sleeping Sickness Commission in 1902 to investigate the epidemic.[28] Led by George Carmichael Low from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the team included his colleague Aldo Castellani and Cuthbert Christy, a medical officer on duty in Bombay, India.[29][30] The expedition was a failure as they found that bacteria or helminths were not involved in the disease.[31]/nThe second Commission in 1902 was entrusted to Bruce, assisted by David Nunes Nabarro from the University College Hospital. By August 1903, Bruce and his team established that the disease was transmitted the tsetse fly, Glossina palpalis.[32][33] The relationship with the fly disease in animals became obvious. In the third Commission (1908\u20131912) Bruce and his colleagues established the complete developmental stages of the trypanosome in tsetse fly.[34][35]/nBruce was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1899. He served as editor of the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps between 1904 and 1908. He was the recipient of the Cameron prize of Edinburgh University in 1901. He received the Royal Society's Royal Medal in 1904, the Mary Kingsley Medal in 1905, and the Stewart prize of the British Medical Association. He was Croonian lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians in 1915.[6] He was awarded the Leeuwenhoek Medal in 1915, created a Companion of the Bath (CB) in the 1905 Birthday Honours, knighted in 1908 and upgraded to a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in 1918.[1] He was president of the British Science Association during 1924\u20131925.[36]/nBruce's name features on the frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Twenty-three names of public health and tropical medicine pioneers were chosen to feature on the School building in Keppel Street when it was constructed in 1926.[37]/nBruce was nominated 31 times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine between 1904 and 1932 for his discoveries in trypanosomiasis, but was never selected.[38]", "4976893": "Hans Neurath (October 29, 1909 \u2013 April 2002) was a biochemist, a leader in protein chemistry, and the founding chairman of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle.

Along with Tatum's student Ed Reich, Luck was the first to isolate mitochondrial DNA and show that it was inherited maternally when Neurospora mate.[1]/nIn 1964, Luck was promoted to research associate and professor at Rockefeller. Luck's research group went on to show that the ribosomal RNAs in mitochondria were synthesized in the mitochondria (rather than in the cell nucleus). By 1970, Luck was promoted to full professor.[1] In 1972, with student Paul Lizardi, Luck's group showed that in contrast to the ribosomal RNAs, mitochondrial ribosome-associated proteins were made in the cytoplasm and transported into the mitochondria.[1] In the mid-1970s, Luck's group pivoted to focus on the single-celled alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, where he focused on centrioles and basal bodies, the microtubule organizing structures that underlie the mitotic spindle and formation of flagella.[1] Luck's group identified around a dozen flagellar proteins, as well as numerous mutations that affected flagellar structure and function.[1]/nLuck was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1984.[2]/nLuck died of lymphoma at New York Hospital on May 23, 1998.[2]", "53834008": "Henry A.

He was a professor of theriogenology and biotechnology at Seoul National University until he was dismissed on March 20, 2006. He was considered a pioneering expert in stem cell research and even called the \"Pride of Korea\".[2][3] However, he became infamous around November 2005 for fabricating a series of stem cell experiments that were published in high-profile journals, the case known as the Hwang affair./nHwang was best known for two articles published in the journal Science in 2004 and 2005, where he reported he had succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells by cloning. However, soon after the first paper was released, an article in the journal Nature charged Hwang with having committed ethical violations by using eggs from his graduate students and from the black market.[4] Although he denied the charges at first, Hwang admitted the allegations were true in November 2005.[5] Shortly after this, data from his human cloning experiments was revealed to have been falsified./nOn May 12, 2006, Hwang was charged with embezzlement and bioethics law violations after it emerged much of his stem cell research had been faked.[6] The Korea Times reported on June 10, 2007, that Seoul National University fired him, and the South Korean government canceled his financial support and barred him from engaging in stem cell research.[7] Hwang was sentenced to a two years suspended prison sentence at the Seoul Central District Court on 26 October 2009, after being found guilty of embezzlement and bioethical violations but cleared of fraud.[8][9] On the same day, CNN reported that the scientist in 2006 had admitted faking his findings, after questions of impropriety had emerged.[10] He had his conviction upheld but his suspended sentence reduced by 6 months on 15 December 2010 by an appeals court in South Korea.[11] In 2014, the South Korean Supreme Court upheld its 2010 ruling.[12]/nSince the controversy, Hwang has maintained a relatively low profile, but continues to work in scientific fields. As of September 2020, he worked at the Sooam Bioengineering Research Institute in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, leading research efforts into creating cloned pig embryos and embryonic stem cell lines.[13] In February 2011, Hwang visited Libya as part of a US$133 million project in the North African country to build a stem cell research center and transfer relevant technology. The project was canceled due to the 2011 Libyan civil war.[14] In November 2015, a Chinese biotech company Boyalife Group announced that it would partner with Hwang's laboratory, Sooam Biotech, to open the world's largest animal cloning factory in Tianjin. The factory would aim to produce up to one million cattle embryos per year to meet the increasing demand for quality beef in China.[15]/nHwang first caught media attention in South Korea when he announced he had successfully created a cloned dairy cow, Yeongrong-i in February 1999. His alleged success was touted as the fifth instance in the world in cow cloning, with a notable caveat: Hwang failed to provide scientifically verifiable data for the research, giving only media sessions and photo ops. Hwang's next claim came in April 1999, when he announced the cloning of a Korean cow, Jin-i, also without providing any scientifically verifiable data. Despite the notable absence of any of the scientific data needed to probe the validity of the research, Hwang's several claims were well-received by the South Korean media and public, who were attracted by Hwang's claim of immeasurable economic prospect that his research was said to be promising. The claims of his research results resulted in him being awarded the Scientist of the Year Award by the Korea Science Journalists Association.[16] Until 2004, Hwang's main area of research remained in creating genetically modified livestock that included cows and pigs. During that period, Hwang claimed to have created a BSE-resistant cow (which has not been verified), and also stated his intention to clone a Siberian tiger./nIn February 2004, Hwang and his team announced that they had successfully created an embryonic stem cell by the somatic cell nuclear transfer method, and published their paper in the March 12 issue of Science.[17] Although Hwang had already established himself as an expert in animal cloning and secured celebrity status in South Korea in the late 1990s, his alleged sudden success came as a surprise because this was the first reported success in human somatic cell cloning. Until Hwang's claim, it was generally agreed that creating a human stem cell by cloning was next to impossible due to the complexity of primates. Hwang explained that his team used 242 eggs to create a single cell line./nIn May, Nature journal published an article stating that Hwang had used eggs taken from two of his graduate students, based on an interview with one of the students. The article raised the question of whether the students might have been pressured to give eggs and thus whether such a donation would have been \"voluntary\" as Hwang claimed in his scientific paper. At that time, Hwang denied that he had used his students' eggs.[4]/nHwang's team announced an even greater achievement a year later in May 2005, and claimed they had created 11 human embryonic stem cells using 185 eggs. His work, published in the June 17 issue of Science,[18] was instantly hailed as a breakthrough in biotechnology because the cells were allegedly created with somatic cells from patients of different age and gender, while the stem cell of 2004 was created with eggs and somatic cells from a single female donor. This meant every patient could receive custom-made treatment with no immune reactions. In addition, Hwang's claim meant that his team had boosted their success rate by 14 times and that this technology could be medically viable./nHwang made further headlines in May 2005 when he criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's policy on embryonic stem cell research. Also, Time magazine named Hwang one of its \"People Who Mattered 2004\", stating that Hwang \"has already proved that human cloning is no longer science fiction, but a fact of life.\"[19]/nFollowing on the earlier success, on August 3, 2005, Hwang announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, which was independently verified through genetic testing. The dog, an Afghan Hound, was named Snuppy./nShortly after his groundbreaking 2005 work, Hwang was appointed to head the new World Stem Cell Hub, a facility that was to be the world's leading stem cell research center. However, in November 2005, Gerald Schatten, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who had worked with Hwang for two years, made the surprise announcement that he had ceased his collaboration with Hwang. In an interview, Schatten commented that \"my decision is grounded solely on concerns regarding oocyte (egg) donations in Hwang's research reported in 2004.\" Following an intense media probe, Roh Sung-il, one of Hwang's close collaborators and head of MizMedi Women's Hospital, held a news conference on November 21. During the conference, Roh admitted that he had paid women US$1,400 each for donating their eggs which were later used in Hwang's research. Roh claimed Hwang was unaware of this, while the South Korean Ministry of Health asserted that no laws or ethical guidelines had been breached as there were no commercial interests involved. Hwang maintained that he was unaware that this had happened, and resigned from his post./nOn November 22, PD Su-cheop (Producer's Note), a popular MBC investigative reporting show, raised the possibility of unethical conduct  in the egg cell-acquiring process. Despite the factual accuracy of the report, news media as well as people caught up in nationalistic fervor in their unwavering support for Hwang asserted that criticism of Hwang's work was \"unpatriotic\", so much so that the major companies who were sponsoring the show immediately withdrew their support./nOn November 24, Hwang held a press conference in Seoul, in which he declared his intention of resigning from most of his official posts. He also apologized for his actions[which?] and said, \"I was blinded by work and my drive for achievement.\" He denied coercing his researchers into donating eggs and claimed that he found out about the situation only after it had occurred. He added that he had lied about the source of the eggs donated to protect the privacy of his female researchers, and that he was not aware of the Declaration of Helsinki, which clearly enumerates his actions as a breach of ethical conduct. After the press conference, which was aired on all major South Korean television networks, many of the nation's media outlets, government ministries, and members of the public expressed sympathy for Hwang./nOn December 29, 2005, the university determined that all 11 of Hwang's stem cell lines were fabricated.[20] The university announced on January 10, 2006, that Hwang's 2004 and 2005 papers in Science were both fabricated. Following on the confirmation of scientific misconduct, on January 11, Science unconditionally retracted both of Hwang's papers.[21]/nOn January 12, 2006, Hwang held a press conference to apologize for the fiasco, but did not admit to cheating. Instead, he blamed other members of his research project for having deceived him with false data and alleged a conspiracy, saying that his projects had been sabotaged and that there was theft of materials involved. He said that cloning human stem cells was possible and that he had the technology to do it, and if he were given six more months he could prove it. This is an extension of the ten days he said he needed to re-create the stem cells that he asked for back on December 16, 2005. Seoul prosecutors started a criminal investigation and raided Hwang's home that day./nOn January 20, 2006, Hwang maintained that two of his 11 forged stem cell lines had been maliciously switched for cells from regular, not cloned, embryos. The allegation involves the lines Hwang claims to have created at Seoul-based MizMedi Hospital.[22]/nOn November 22, 2016, Hwang received a certificate of patent on NT-1 technology from the Korean Intellectual Property Office.[citation needed]/nIn the late 1990s, the method that scientists used in cloning was somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is the same procedure that was used to create Dolly the sheep. This laboratory technique begins when an egg is taken from a donor and the nucleus is removed from the egg, creating an enucleated egg. A cell, which contains DNA, is then taken from the animal being cloned. The enucleated egg is then fused together with the nucleus of the cloning subject's cell using electricity. This creates an embryo, which is implanted into a surrogate mother through in vitro fertilization. If the procedure is successful, then the surrogate mother will give birth to a baby that is a clone of the cloning subject at the end of a normal gestation period. In 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten[23] but in 1996 it took 277 attempts to create Dolly./nHwang allegedly used this technique at his laboratory in SNU to clone dogs during his experiments throughout the early 2000s. He claimed that it was possible to clone mammals and that probability for success can be better than 1 in 277 attempts (as in similar cases such as Dolly). Hwang was the first in the world to clone a dog, an Afghan hound called Snuppy in 2005.  He described his procedure for cloning in the journal  Nature.[24] Researchers from the Seoul National University[25] and the US National Institutes of Health[26] confirmed that Snuppy was a clone.  Since then Hwang and his associates have cloned many more dogs.[27][28][29] In 2015, it was reported that Huang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech had produced 700 cloned puppies since 2005, with their owners paying about $100,000 each to have their dogs cloned.[29][30][31][32]/nHwang's intention to develop better technique for cloning was focused on stem cells because they are still at an early stage of development and retain the potential to turn into many different types of cell and when they divide, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function./nAccording to stem cell biologists, it might be possible to harness this ability to turn stem cells into a super \"repair kit\" for the body, theoretically to use stem cells to generate healthy tissue to replace that either damaged by trauma or compromised by disease.\nThe many conditions and illnesses that may eventually be treated by stem cell therapy include Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, burns, and spinal cord damage./nIn March 2012, it was announced that Hwang would collaborate with Russian scientists in an attempt to clone a woolly mammoth from remains found in Siberia.[33][34] He had previously successful cloned eight coyotes in March 2011 using domestic dogs[32][34] and grey wolves as surrogate mothers.[35] However no mammoth sample fit for cloning had been found as of 2015.[32][36]/nIn 2015, the Chinese company BoyaLife[37] announced that in partnership with the Hwang Woo-suk's company Sooam Biotech, they were planning to build a 200 million RMB (about US$32 million) factory in Tianjin, China to produce 100,000 cloned cattle per year to supply China's growing market for quality beef, starting in 2016.[31]/nIn 2015, Sooam Biotech cloned a male boxer puppy from a pet dog that had been dead for 12 days. This was the first time they had cloned a dog that had been dead for such a long time.[30]/nIn 2016, Hwang's company was regularly cloning pigs which were genetically predisposed to certain diseases so that they could be used for testing pharmaceuticals, and cloning cattle which were highly valued for their meat. In total Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing roughly 500 cloned embryos a day from various species.[35] They were also reported to be attempting to clone the Ethiopian wolf, one of the world's rarest canids, of which there are only 500 in the wild, another endangered canid, the dhole, of which there only about 2,500 adults, and the Siberian musk deer, which is classified as vulnerable by the IUCN.[35]/nUntil late November 2005, Hwang was criticized only for unpublicized ethical violations. Colleagues and media outlets asserted that he had paid female donors for egg donations and that he had received donations from two junior researchers, both of which were violations. Later controversies centered around scientific misconduct./nHis team, which cloned the first human embryo to use for research, said they had used the same technology to create batches of embryonic stem cells from nine patients. According to Hwang, the result was much more efficient than they had hoped.\nHwang's integrity as a researcher was again put in doubt when it was revealed that PD Su-cheop had scheduled a follow-up report questioning his achievement published in Science in June 2005, which stated he had cloned 11 lines of embryonic stem cells. This caused furious backlash among many South Koreans, and the reaction only intensified when it was discovered that Kim Sun-Jong, one of Hwang's researchers from MizMedi, had been coerced by illegal means to testify against Hwang. As a result, the scheduled broadcast was canceled and the network made a public apology to the nation, everyone more or less operating under the assumption that the show was at fault and not Hwang. Yet, other news outlets began to question Hwang's claims./nClose scrutiny revealed that several of the photos of purportedly different cells were in fact photos of the same cell. Hwang responded that these additional photos were accidentally included and that there was no such duplication in the original submission to Science. This was later confirmed by the journal./nResearchers raised questions about striking similarities between the DNA profiles of the cloned cells. Then collaborator Gerald Schatten asked Science to remove his name from the paper, stating as a reason that there were \"allegations from someone involved with the experiments that certain elements of the report may be fabricated.\"/nIn the midst of national confusion, Hwang disappeared from public sight, to be hospitalized days later for alleged stress-related fatigue, while public opinion gradually began to turn against Hwang with even the major Korean companies who had withdrawn their support from PD Su-cheop reportedly now less than pleased with Hwang. Days later, Hwang started going to his laboratory while requesting Seoul National University to officially conduct a probe to the allegations surrounding him./nThe scandal took a dramatic turn on December 15, when Roh Sung-il, who had collaborated on the disputed paper, stated to media outlets that nine of those eleven lines had been faked; specifically, DNA tests illustrated that those nine lines shared identical DNA, implying that they had come from the same source. Roh stated that \"Professor Hwang admitted to fabrication\", and that he, Hwang, and another co-author had asked Science to withdraw the paper.[38] Adding fuel to the fire, MBC broadcast the content of the canceled PD Su-cheop show, which substantiated Roh's claim./nOn the same day, The Seattle Times reported that Science had not yet received an official request from Hwang to withdraw the paper, and it had refused to remove Schatten's name from the paper, stating, \"No single author, having declared at the time of submission his full and complete confidence in the contents of the paper, can retract his name unilaterally, after publication.\"[39]/nSeveral prominent scientists, including Ian Wilmut, who cloned Dolly the sheep in 1996, and Bob Lanza, a cloning expert based in Worcester, Massachusetts, did call on Hwang to submit his paper to an outside group for independent analysis. Lanza noted, \"You can't fake the results if they're carried out by an independent group. I think this simple test could put the charges to rest.\"/nTwo major press conferences were held on Korean television networks on December 16, one with Hwang, followed by one with his former colleague, Roh Sung-il. Hwang started his press conference by claiming that the technology to make stem cells existed\u2014not an explicit denial that the stem cell lines he used in his paper to Science were fakes. He, however, acknowledged the falsifications of research data in the paper, attributing them to unrecoverable \"artificial mistakes\". He said that there was a problem with the original lines caused by contamination, and if he were given ten more days he could re-create the stem cell lines. He accused Kim Sun-Jong, a former collaborator, of \"switching\" some of the stem cell lines./nDespite Hwang's claim, in another press conference held only minutes later, Roh Sung-il rebutted Hwang's accusation, saying Hwang was blackmailing MizMedi and Kim Sun-jong. He maintained that at least nine of the eleven stem cell lines were fakes and that Hwang was simply untrustworthy./n\"Roh Sung-il, chairman of the board at Mizmedi Hospital, told KBS television that Hwang had agreed to ask the journal Science to withdraw the paper, published in June to international acclaim. Roh was one of the co-authors of the article that detailed how individual stem cell colonies were created for 11 patients through cloning. Roh also told MBC television that Hwang had pressured a former scientist at his lab to fake data to make it look like there were 11 stem cell colonies. In a separate report, a former researcher told MBC that Hwang ordered him to fabricate photos to make it appear there were 11 separate colonies from only three. [...] University of Pittsburgh researcher Gerald Schatten has already asked that Science remove him as the senior author of the report, citing questions about the paper's accuracy. Seoul National University announced this week it would conduct an internal probe into Hwang's research.\"[40]/nSome scientists have started questioning Hwang's earlier work published in Science in February 2004, in which he claimed to have cloned embryonic stem cells. Maria Biotech head Park Se-pill said, \"Up until now, I have believed Hwang did derive cloned embryonic stem cells although he admitted to misconduct in his follow-up paper on patient-specific stem cells...Now, I am not sure whether the cloned stem cell really existed.\"[41]/nOn July 26, 2006, Hwang said in testimony that he spent part of 500 million won in private donations in attempts to clone extinct Russian mammoths and Korean tigers.[42]/nAn internal panel was set up in Seoul National University to investigate the allegation, and the probe was started on December 17, 2005. The panel sealed off Hwang's laboratory and conducted a thorough investigation, collecting testimonies from Hwang, Roh and other people who were involved with the scandal. On December 23, the panel announced its initial finding that Hwang had intentionally fabricated stem cell research results creating nine fake cell lines out of eleven, and added that the validity of two remaining cell lines is yet to be confirmed. The panel stated that Hwang's misconduct is \"a grave act damaging the foundation of science.\" Hwang's claim of having used only 185 eggs to create stem cell lines was also denied by the panel, which indicated that more eggs may have been used in the research process./nThe panel announced additional findings on December 29, and confirmed that no patient-matched embryonic stem cells existed, and that Hwang's team did not have the scientific data to prove any of the stem cells had ever been made.[43]/nIn its final report published on January 10, 2006, the panel reaffirmed its previous findings while announcing additional discoveries.[44] The panel found out that, contrary to Hwang's claim of having used 185 eggs for his team's 2005 paper, at least 273 eggs were shown to have been used according to research records kept in Hwang's lab. In addition, the panel discovered that Hwang's team was supplied with 2,061 eggs in the period of November 28, 2002, to December 8, 2005. Hwang's claim of not having known about the donation of eggs by his own female researchers was also denied by the panel; in fact, it was discovered that Hwang himself had distributed egg donation consent forms to his researchers and personally escorted one to the MizMedi Hospital to perform the egg extraction procedure./nThe panel stated that Hwang's 2004 Science paper was also fabricated and decided the stem cell discussed in the paper may have been generated by a case of parthenogenetic process (which is itself a significant development, as mammals rarely reproduce by parthenogenesis; in addition, this would make Hwang's lab the first ever to successfully generate human stem cells via parthenogenesis, predating other research facilities' successes).[45] Although Hwang's team didn't rule out the possibility of parthenogenetic process in the paper, the panel said, his team didn't make any conscientious effort to probe the possibility through the tests available./nChung Myunghee, the head of the panel, said at a news conference that the panel was not in a position to investigate Hwang's claim of his stem cells having been switched with MizMedi's, but added that such a claim was incomprehensible when there were no data to prove any of the stem cells were ever made to begin with./nThe panel, in conclusion, stated that Hwang's team intentionally fabricated the data in both the 2004 and the 2005 papers, and that it was \"an act of deception targeted to both scientific community and general public.\" However, the panel confirmed that Hwang's team had actually succeeded in cloning a dog they named Snuppy. (See also Nature 439:122-123)/nOn December 23, 2005, Hwang apologized for \"creating a shock and a disappointment\" and announced that he was resigning his position as professor at the university.[46] However, Hwang maintained that patient-matched stem cell technology remained in South Korea, and his countrymen would see it./nSeoul National University said Hwang's resignation request would not be accepted, citing a university regulation that dictates that an employee under investigation may not resign from a post, thus avoiding full retribution and possibly dismissal if found at fault, while benefiting from an  honorable voluntary resignation./nOn February 9, 2006, the university suspended Hwang's position as a professor, together with six other faculty members who participated in Hwang's team;[47] Hwang was dismissed  on March 20, 2006./nOn May 12, 2006, Hwang was indicted on charges of embezzlement and breach of the country's bioethics law, without physical detention. Prosecutors also brought fraud charges against the three stem cell researchers. He embezzled 2.8 billion won (US$3 million) out of some 40 billion won in research funds, for personal purposes and the illegal purchase of ova used in his experiments./nThe prosecution also said Hwang's three associates involved in his stem cell research, Yoon Hyun-soo, Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, also misappropriated tens of millions of won in research money. Investigators have been tracking 24.6 billion won to find out how the research money was spent. It was part of Hwang's 36.9 billion won research funds raised through state support and private donations. Investigators said Hwang used bank accounts held by relatives and subordinates in 2002 and 2003 to receive about 475 million won from private organizations. He allegedly laundered the money by withdrawing it all in cash, breaking it up into smaller amounts and putting it back in various bank accounts. Hwang also withdrew 140 million won in August 2001 to buy gifts for his sponsors, including politicians and other prominent social figures, before Chusok holidays, according to prosecutors. He also allegedly misappropriated around 26 million won in research funds in September 2004 to buy a car for his wife. Hwang is suspected of embezzling 600 million won, provided by a private foundation, on multiple occasions from 2001 to 2005 for personal use. Prosecutors are also accusing him of illegally paying some 38 million won to 25 women who provided ova for his research through Hanna Women's Clinic in the first eight months of 2005. They also said Hwang gave several dozen politicians about 55 million won in political funds on numerous occasions from 2001 to 2005. He allegedly provided 14 million won to executives of large companies that provided financial support for his research. The prosecution added Hwang wired about 200 million won to a Korean American, identified only as Kang, in September 2005 and received the equivalent amount in U.S. currency from him when the scientist visited the United States two months later. Also in 2005, Hwang received one billion won each in research funds from SK Group and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation based on his fabricated stem cell research results. Meanwhile, investigators said Lee Byeong-chun and Kang Sung-keun, both professors of veterinary science at Seoul National University, embezzled about 300 million won and 100 million won each in state funds by inflating research-related expenses. Yoon Hyun-soo, a biology professor at Hanyang University, also embezzled 58 million won from the research fund managed by MizMedi Hospital.[48]/nOn August 2, 2007, after much independent investigation, it was revealed that Hwang's team succeeded in extracting cells from eggs that had undergone parthenogenesis. Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned human embryos. However, further examination of the cells' chromosomes shows the same indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells as are found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned human embryos, he did contribute a major breakthrough to the field of stem cell research. The process may offer a way for creating stem cells that are genetically matched to a particular woman for the treatment of degenerative diseases.[49]/nThe news of the breakthrough came just a month after an announcement from the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISC), a California-based stem cell research company, that they had successfully created the first human embryos through parthenogenesis. Although the actual results of Hwang's work were just published, those embryos were created by him and his team before February 2004, when the fabricated cloning results were announced, which would make them the first to successfully perform the process. Jeffrey Janus, president and director of research for ISC, agrees that \"Dr. Hwang's cells have characteristics found in parthenogenetic cells\" but remains cautious, saying \"it needs more study.\"[50]/nAfter having acquired a celebrity status in South Korea, Hwang actively sought to establish every possible tie to political and economic institutions in the country. Hwang especially tried to win favor from the Roh Moo-hyun government, which in turn was suffering from a lack of popular support and wanted to demonstrate its competency by creating and promoting an exemplary policy success./nHwang approached Park Ki-young, a former biology professor, then appointed as the Information, Science and Technology Advisor for the President, and put her as one of the co-authors in his 2004 Science paper. Ties with Park yielded a favorable environment for Hwang in the government, as a non-official group consisting of high-ranking government officials was created to support Hwang's research that includes not only Hwang and Park, but also Kim Byung-joon, Chief National Policy Secretary, and Jin Dae-je, Information and Communications Minister. The group was dubbed as \"Hwang-kum-pak-chui\", a loose acronym made from member's family names, which means \"golden bat\" in Korean./nAfter Hwang's paper was published in Science in 2005, support for Hwang came in full swing. In June 2005, the Ministry of Science and Technology selected Hwang as the first recipient of the title Supreme Scientist, an honor worth US$15 million.[51] Hwang, having already claimed the title of POSCO Chair Professor worth US$1.5 million, secured more than US$27 million worth of support in that year.[52]/nPresident Roh had been acquainted with Hwang since 2003, and made a number of comments intended to protect him from potential bioethical issues. On June 18, 2004, Roh awarded Hwang a medal and said, \"it is not possible nor desirable to prohibit research, just because there are concerns that it may lead to a direction that is deemed unethical.\" In another instance at the opening of World Stem Cell Hub on October 19, 2005, Roh remarked, \"politicians have a responsibility to manage bioethical controversies, not to get in the way of this outstanding research and progress.\"[53]/nOn December 5, 2005, after PD Su-cheop stirred a national controversy, Cheong Wa Dae reaffirmed its unflinching support for Hwang and his research team. Roh said, \"We'll continue to support Professor Hwang. We hope he will return to his research lab soon for the sake of people with physical difficulties and the public\", according to presidential spokesman Kim Man-soo./nWhile implying the controversies over MBC-TV's forceful methods used to gather information from Hwang's former junior staff members, Roh said, \"The disputes will be resolved gradually and naturally through following scientific research and study. We hope the ongoing disputes over Hwang's achievement will be settled without further trouble.\"[54]/nIt was alleged that advisor Park Ki-young deliberately avoided to report Roh about details of Hwang's allegation for misconduct, while emphasizing a breach of journalist ethics by MBC. Park, after weeks of silence for her role in the controversy, announced her intent to resign from the advisor post on January 10, 2006./nOn January 11, 2006, the national post office stopped selling post stamps commemorating Hwang's research. The title of Supreme Scientist awarded to Hwang was revoked on March 21, 2006, after Hwang was dismissed from Seoul National University the day before./nOn December 6, 2005, a group of 43 lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties  inaugurated a body to support  Hwang Woo-suk. Members of the group, dubbed the \"lawmakers' group supporting Professor Hwang Woo-suk\", pledged to help Hwang continue his experiments in pursuit of a scientific breakthrough./n\"There are many lawmakers who, regardless of party affiliation, want to support Hwang. We will join forces to help Hwang devote himself to his studies\", Rep. Kwon Sun-taik of the ruling Uri Party said in a news conference at the National Assembly, who was also the leader of the group./nHe said the group would seek to establish bioethics guidelines and come up with supporting measures for biotechnology researchers in the country.

Until his death, Levins was a university professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a long-time political activist. He was best known for his work on evolution and complexity in changing environments and on metapopulations./nLevins also had written on philosophical issues in biology and modelling. One of his influential articles is \"The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology\". He has influenced a number of contemporary philosophers of biology.[citation needed] Levins often boasted publicly that he was a 'fourth generation Marxist' and often had said that the methodology in his Evolution in Changing Environments was based upon the introduction to Marx's Grundrisse, the author's notes (not published until 1939) for Das Kapital. With the evolutionary geneticist Richard Lewontin, Levins had written a number of articles on methodology, philosophy, and social implications of biology. Many of these are collected in The Dialectical Biologist. In 2007, the duo published a second thematic collection of essays titled Biology Under the Influence: Dialectical Essays on Ecology, Agriculture, and Health.[7]/nAlso with Lewontin, Levins had co-authored a number of satirical articles criticizing sociobiology, systems modeling in ecology, and other topics under the pseudonym Isadore Nabi. Levins and Lewontin managed to place a ridiculous biography of Nabi and his achievements in American Men of Science, thereby showing how little editorial care and fact-checking work went on in that respected reference work./nRichard Levins was of Ukrainian Jewish heritage and was born  on June 1, 1930, in Brooklyn, New York.[8] He recorded reminiscences of his politically and scientifically precocious childhood in an article in Red Diapers. He reportedly had read Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters (1926) at age 8 (in 1938) and his first of Charles Darwin's books at age 12 (in 1942). At the age of 10, Levins had been inspired by the essays of the Marxist biological polymath J. B. S. Haldane, whom Levins considers to be the equal of Albert Einstein in scientific importance./nLevins studied agriculture and mathematics at Cornell. He married Puerto Rican writer Rosario Morales in 1950.  Blacklisted on his graduation from Cornell, he and Rosario moved to Puerto Rico, where they farmed and did rural organizing. They returned to New York in 1956, where he earned his PhD at Columbia University (awarded 1965). Levins taught at the University of Puerto Rico from 1961 to 1967 and was a prominent member of the Puerto Rican independence movement.  He visited Cuba for the first time in 1964, beginning a lifelong scientific and political collaboration with Cuban biologists. His active participation in the independence and anti-war movements in Puerto Rico led to his being denied tenure at the University of Puerto Rico, and in 1967 he and Rosario and their three children - Aurora,[9] Ricardo,[1] and Alejandro[2] - moved to Chicago, where he taught at the University of Chicago and constantly interacted with Lewontin.  Both Richard and Rosario later moved to Harvard with the sponsorship of E. O. Wilson, with whom they had later disputes over sociobiology. Levins was elected member of the US National Academy of Sciences but resigned because of the Academy's role in advising the US military during the war. He had been a member of the US and Puerto Rican Communist Parties, the Movimiento Pro Independencia[10][11] (the Independence movement in Puerto Rico), and the Puerto Rican Socialist Party, and he was on an FBI surveillance list./nUntil his death, Levins was John Rock Professor of Population Sciences[12] and head of the Human Ecology program[13][14] in the Department of Global Health and Population of the Harvard School of Public Health.[15] In the early 1990s, Levins and others formed the Harvard Working Group on New and Resurgent Diseases. Their work showed that alarming new infections had sprung from changes in the environment, either natural or caused by humans (Wilson et al. 1994).[16]/nDuring his final two decades, Levins had concentrated on application of ecology to agriculture, particularly in the economically less-well-developed nations of this planet.  As a member of the OXFAM-America Board of Directors and former chair of their subcommittee on Latin America and the Caribbean, Richard Levins worked from a critique of the industrial-commercial pathway of development and promoted alternative development pathways which focused attention upon (a) economic viability with (b) population equity, (c) ecological and social sustainability, and (d) empowerment of the dispossessed./nWhen his wife Rosario died in 2011, his daughter Aurora moved in with her father in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home./nOne of Levins's grandchildren is Minneapolis-based hip hop artist Manny Phesto.[17][18]/nLevins died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on January 19, 2016.[19][20]/nA species of lizard, Sphaerodactylus levinsi, is named in his honor.[21]/nPrior to Levins' work, population genetics had assumed the environment to be constant, while mathematical ecology assumed the genetic makeup of the species involved to be constant. Levins modelled the situation in which evolution is taking place while the environment changes. One of the surprising consequences of his model is that selection need not maximize adaptation, and that species can select themselves to extinction. He encapsulated his major early results in Evolution in Changing Environments, a book based on lectures he delivered in Cuba in the early 1960s. Levins made extensive use of mathematics, some of which he invented himself, although it had been previously developed in other areas of pure mathematics or economics without his awareness of it. For instance, Levins makes extensive use of convex set theory for fitness sets, (resembling the economic formulations of J. R. Hicks) and extends Sewall Wright's path analysis to the analysis of causal feedback loops./nThe term metapopulation was coined by Levins in 1969 to describe a \"population of populations\".[22] Populations inhabit a landscape of suitable habitat patches, each capable of hosting a local sub-population. Local populations may become extinct and be subsequently recolonized by immigration from patches; the fate of such a system of local populations (i.e., the metapopulation) depends on the balance between extinctions and colonizations. Levins introduced a model consisting of a single differential equation, nowadays known as the Levins model, to describe the dynamics of average patch occupancy in such systems. Metapopulation theory has since become an important area of spatial ecology, with applications in conservation biology, population management, and pest control.[23][24]", "20574526": "Kirsten Bomblies is an American biological researcher.

She was married to Roy Waldo Miner, a curator of zoology at the American Museum of Natural History,[5] 23 Jun 1926 in North Adams, Berkshire, Massachusetts.  He was a former president of the New York Academy of Sciences.[6] Among her many friends was the renowned anthropologist Margaret Mead, whom she met while both women were working as research assistants at the American Museum of Natural History.[7]  During her retirement years, she moved to Florida. She died on March 18, 1993, in Florida.[4]/nMiner served as the director of the Marine Historical Museum, a board member of the International Foundation for Sciences, director of the National Paraplegia Fund, and many different administrative roles at the New York Academy of Sciences. \nShe was appointed to the position of executive secretary of the New York Academy of Sciences in October 1939 by the scientific council of the academy. Her first efforts as the executive secretary were to conduct a series of membership drives which, according to Simon Baatz, the success of which \"relied more heavily on a gregarious nature than on the scientific merits of the organization.\"[8]/nBy 1948, the membership of the academy was at 4,000 and required the academy to find a new home outside of the two rooms provided as meeting space by the American Museum of Natural History. The academy launched a $1,000,000 fund drive for the purchase of a new home.[9] Part of Miner's responsibilities in the fundraising campaign included soliciting donations from wealthy philanthropists including Normal Woolworth.[8] Woolworth was \"so impressed by Miner's eloquence, energy, and enthusiasm that, upon learning of the Academy search for a new home, simply donated his mansion with the sole requirement that the Academy pay all the necessary legal fees involved in the transfer.\"[8] While Miner was successful in securing the academy a new home, there is little evidence that the academy was successful in raising $1,000,000. However, the campaign did raise enough funds to refurbish the Woolworth house which was donated to the academy as a $1,000,000 gift in 1948.[10] These updates allowed the academy to thrive as a central meeting place in the New York scientific community for special events and conferences./nMiner retired as executive director of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1967. At the time of her retirement, the academy held a special symposium to honor her great achievements for the institution at the annual meeting.

She demonstrated that tissue from the dorsal lip of the blastopore grafted into a host embryo can induce the formation of an extra body axis, creating conjoined twins. Crucially, by using two  species of newt with different skin colors for host and donor, she showed that the amphibian organizer did not form the extra axis by itself, but recruited host tissue to form the twin (although the full implications of this result were not understood until a year after her death).[2][6] This was the basis of the discovery of the \"organizer\", which is responsible for gastrulation.[2]", "67006789": "Beatriz Morales-Nin is a marine ecologist and expert in fish and sustainable management of fishery resources.[1][2][3][4] She is currently a research professor at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (IMEDEA).[5] She is a leading Spanish expert in sclerochronology where her main field of research is fish otoliths.[6]/nShe studied at the Escuela Montessori and the Institut Monserrat Archived 2020-03-26 at the Wayback Machine in Barcelona.

Additionally, Lynch does a lot of explaining of space science to the public, both directly and through the media.[4]/nLynch summarizes her biosignature research as \"All life poops.\"[8][31] In other words, all life uses energy and excretes waste products. Some of those waste products might be preserved and appear as biosignatures, telling us that life exists\u2014or formerly existed.[8][32] Lynch identifies biosignatures in environments on Earth that might be analogous to ones on other planets, teaching us what signals we might use to recognize extraterrestrial life.[2][5][4][32]/nMuch of Lynch's biosignature research has focused on perchlorates, a kind of salt, in the Pilot Valley part of Great Salt Lake Desert, Utah, USA.[8][32] Pilot Valley is a hypersaline paleolake basin, an ancient lake that used to be quite deep but has now receded. It used to be a freshwater lake, but as climate change caused evaporation, it has become increasingly salinated. A lot of lake sediments remain, teeming with a diversity of microbes.[8][4][32] Lynch looks for microbial DNA and strives to understand what the microbial communities look like with regard to diversity, aspects of life such as what they eat or how they obtain energy, and even how various microbes interact with each other.[8][4][32] Lynch discovered the first known place on earth where there are both perchlorates and perchlorates-reducing (essentially perchlorates-consuming) microbes.[8]/nLynch selected Pilot Valley as the site to carry out research for her doctoral dissertation, \"A Geobiological Investigation of the Hypersaline Sediments of Pilot Valley, Utah: A Terrestrial Analog to Ancient Lake Basins on Mars.\"[33] Ultimately, Jezero Crater was selected as the landing site for the 2020 Mars mission, Perseverance, because it is also a paleolake.[7][8] It is expected to contain percholates, and would be an ideal candidate for a location containing percholates-reducing bacteria, should there be signs of life on Mars. Because Jezero Crater has signs of a former delta, meaning water was flowing in from an upstream location, Lynch argues that sediments from three environments potentially converge there\u2014from streams that flowed into the ancient lake; the actual Jezero lake; and groundwater that has surfaced following evaporation of the lake and the streams that feed it.[8][4]/nLynch won NASA's 2020 Selections for the Astrobiology Program Early Career Collaboration Award.[34] She will collaborate with  University of Florida's Amy Williams on sample analysis and Georgetown University's Sarah Stewart on creating a tool for \u201cWorking Towards Life Detection Capability in Subsurface Transitional Habitable Zones on Mars.\u201d[34]/nLynch has over fifty publications and conference publications as of early 2021.[32] She also serves as a manuscript reviewer for JGR Planets,[35] Geobiology, Astrobiology, Planetary and Space Science, as well as a peer reviewer for grants with the NASA Exobiology Program Peer Review Panel and the NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship (NESSF).

The father had five children from two earlier marriages and Philippi was the eldest from the third marriage. In 1818, Philippi, his younger brother Bernhard Eunom (1811\u20131852) and their mother went to Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, where they were educated at the Pestalozzian Institute founded by Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (1746\u20131827). The teaching included the use of natural objects for teaching and Philippi was involved in collecting plants and butterflies at a young age. The move was caused by an affair of their father with the housekeeper and led to the separation of the parents. The three returned to Berlin in 1822 where Philippi went to the K\u00f6nigliche Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (founded in 1574) and in 1826 he moved to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Berlin and graduated in 1830. His studies included medicine, surgery, comparative anatomy, botany and zoology. His dissertation was on the orthoptera of Berlin (Orthoptera Berolinensia). Respiratory illness forced him to leave Berlin in 1830 to warmer parts of Italy where he travelled around with the geologists Friedrich Hoffmann and Arnold Escher von der Lind who were studying Etna and Vesuvius. Philippi began to look at fossils here. He also collected molluscs and interacted with the Italian Benedictine priest and malacologist Emiliano Guttadauro (1759\u20131836) who encouraged him to study molluscs. He returned briefly to Berlin to complete his medical studies and qualified as a physician in 1833. He then worked as a teacher at Kassel from 1835. In 1836 he married a cousin, Caroline Krumwiede, who came from a well-to-do family and hoped that the means would let him study molluscs.[2]/nHis first major work on molluscs based on his collections from Sicily was published in 1836. For this work, he received a medal from Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm III thanks to a recommendation from Alexander von Humboldt. Along with 14 others, he founded the Vereins f\u00fcr Naturkunde (Natural History Society) of Kassel the same year. In 1837 he was diagnosed with pneumonia and told that he had to move to a drier climate. He then moved to Sicily living there for several years, recovering his health. He began to collect molluscs in earnest, making use of a collector trained by Italian malacologist Arcangelo Scacchi  (1810\u20131893). In 1840 he returned to Kassel, with a stop in Neuch\u00e2tel where he met Louis Agassiz. At Kassel, he interacted with the local malacologists who included Karl Menke, who had begin the first journal in German, Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Malakozoologie in 1844. This led to an increased productivity, and he wrote several books including Abbildungen (illustrated monographs), leading to a medal from the new King, Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm IV. His brother Bernhard Eunom Philippi in the meantime became a successful merchant and sailed to Chile several times, making collections for museums. Bernhard moved to Chile in 1841 and encouraged Germans to emigrate to Punta Arenas, an area that he helped seize control of, and had been made a governor of the Magellan Province.[2]/nPhilippi was caught up in the German revolutions of 1848-1849 and was seen as a liberal and threatened. He escaped Kassel with help from another malacologist Friedrich Carl Ludwig Koch (1799\u20131852), whose daughter had been engaged to Bernhard. He stayed underground in Karlsh\u00fctte (near Delligsen, Lower Saxony) and left Germany on 20 July 1851 aboard the Bonito. He left the rest of his family behind and received letters of introduction from Alexander von Humboldt to aid his travels in Chile. Bernhard was killed in Punta Arenas in 1852. Philippi directed a high school in Valdivia from 1853 and he was also appointed professor of zoology and botany at the Universidad de Chile (Santiago), as well as director of the natural history museum there. He was also sent on an expedition into the Atacama Desert. Philippi's wife and children moved to Chile in 1856 but his wife died in 1867 and two children died young. He worked on several books on natural history in Chile and collaborated with travelling European naturalists like Christian Ludwig Landbeck as well as with museums in Europe.

In it, Miranda is an officer of the pro-human group Cerberus, first appearing in the 2009 iOS game Mass Effect Galaxy, and then serving as a squad mate in Mass Effect 2. In addition to these, the character also makes an appearance in the Mass Effect: Redemption comic series, in Mass Effect 3 if she survived the events of the suicide mission in Mass Effect 2, and in issues 5, 6, 8 and 9 of the Mass Effect: Foundation comic series. She is revealed to have been genetically designed by her father, Henry Lawson, to be perfect, and ran away from home to join Cerberus./nMiranda was modelled after Yvonne Strahovski, who also provided the voice for Miranda.[1] Like Strahovski, Miranda was originally blonde but the character was changed to have black hair to complement her \"femme fatale\" look. Camera angles and shots were employed to emphasise her sexuality. David Kates composed her theme for Mass Effect 2. Miranda was featured prominently in promotional art, demo footage, trailers and advertisements for Mass Effect 2.[2]/nThe character has received a generally positive reception, though several commentators have discussed the numerous camera shots of her buttocks in Mass Effect 2, a creative decision then-marketing director of Bioware, David Silverman has defended as an integral part of her character./nIn Mass Effect 2, Miranda Lawson is revealed to be a high-ranking operative of the pro-human organization Cerberus, and has been genetically designed for superior intelligence and physical traits. She is shown to be a capable leader, exemplified with her being one of the few members of the squad who can successfully lead a fireteam in the final mission without anyone dying, despite feeling she does not command respect like Shepard does. Lawson is leader of Cerberus' Lazarus Cell, tasked with reviving Commander Shepard. Aboard the Normandy, the player's spaceship, she is Shepard's second-in-command and Executive Officer, and files mission reports directly to the Illusive Man./nMiranda was the artificially created daughter of Henry Lawson, a rich and powerful businessman from Earth. Rather than give her a human mother to randomize her genetic code, Henry took his own DNA and doubled his X chromosome, hoping to create a dynasty. Unhappy with his attempts to exert control over her life, Miranda joined Cerberus and secretly sent her sister, who was created in the same way she was, into hiding to protect her from their father. Provided the player completes a mission to prevent her sister's abduction, she ultimately becomes loyal to Shepard. In one of the story's possible endings, she proves her loyalty when the Illusive Man gives her an order to prevent Shepard from destroying the Collectors' Space Station by refusing and announcing her resignation before ending the communication abruptly./nEarly concept art for Miranda focused on balancing her sex appeal with a uniform suitable for her position as a Cerberus officer.[3] Originally conceived as blonde, after her uniform was designed, it was decided black hair would fit better with her \"femme fatale\" look.[4] Casey Hudson has said her uniform was made tight due to her being designed to be \"perfect\" and \"beautiful\".[5] For her role as Miranda Lawson, Yvonne Strahovski spoke in her natural speaking voice and native Australian accent.[6]/nMiranda is an example of a character who is defined by the quality of physical attractiveness. In Mass Effect 2, camera angles and shots such as a close-up of her buttocks were employed to focus on \"her curves and sexuality\", identified as key parts of her character, her being someone genetically engineered to be \"perfect\".[5][7] David Kates composed Miranda's musical theme, intending to \"demonstrate her strength, but also her vulnerable side, and a sadness that is deep inside her\".[8] Mac Walters and Patrick Weekes wrote her character for Mass Effect 2. Jay Watamaniuk wrote her for Mass Effect 3./nMiranda is one of Shepard's squad members in Mass Effect 2. She's one of the top agents of the pro-human organization Cerberus, assigned to supervise the \"Lazarus Project\", which was the project that brought Shepard back to life. When Shepard's sent by Cerberus' leader, the Illusive Man, to stop the main antagonists, the Collectors, Miranda joins as the new Normandy's executive officer, giving mission reports to the Illusive Man. Through conversations with her, Shepard learns of Miranda's background. She tells Shepard that she was genetically \"created\" by her father, Henry Lawson, who is one of the wealthiest humans in the galaxy. She tells Shepard that she was created to be the genetically \"perfect\" human, able to heal from injuries more quickly, and with more powerful biotic abilities,[9] as well as exceptional schooling, all as part of her father's desire to have a \"dynasty\" to follow him. Her father's persistence in making Miranda as \"perfect\" as possible resulted in her not having a normal childhood, forbidden from having any friends or relations with anybody else, and forced to enhance her abilities constantly. At an old enough age, Miranda was able to escape from her father, hinting that \"shots were fired\", and fled to Cerberus, who she had learned her father was an investor to. Cerberus gave her asylum, and her father cut off his support of Cerberus./nLater on in the game, Miranda asks Shepard for help to save her sister. She reveals that her father, after Miranda had escaped from him, created another daughter, Miranda's genetic twin sister, Oriana. Miranda was able to rescue Oriana, taking her from her father and giving her to another family to have a normal life. She tells Shepard that her father has been able to track Oriana down and has hired mercenaries to apprehend her. Miranda has arranged for Cerberus to safely move Oriana and her family away but needs Shepard's help. If Shepard helps, Miranda learns that the only friend she ever had or trusted, Niket, had betrayed her and is working with the mercenaries to take Oriana away. The following confrontation leaves the captain of the mercenaries dead as well as Niket, who, depending on Shepard's actions, is killed either by Miranda herself or by the mercenary captain. Afterward, Miranda sees Oriana with her family, and if Shepard convinces her, goes and meets Oriana, introducing herself to her./nAfterward, if Shepard converses with Miranda more, she admits to Shepard that even though she's supposed to be perfect, she feels that everything she had done is the result of her father genetic tailoring of her, not because of her actions. Shepard can convince her that she gives her father too much credit, saying that while he did give Miranda her abilities and gifts, everything she has accomplished is the result of her using those abilities that she had been given. This seems to reassure Miranda and she thanks Shepard for it./nDuring the \"Suicide Mission\", Miranda can survive or die depending on the player's choices in the mission and also if they do Miranda's loyalty mission. If the player uses a male Shepard character, they can pursue Miranda as a possible romance.[10]/nMiranda returns in Mass Effect 3, provided the player does not import a save where she dies. After defeating the Collectors, she has left Cerberus. Given she was a high-ranking Cerberus officer, she indicated the Illusive Man ordered a hit on her, causing her to go on the run. Shepard meets Miranda on the Citadel, where she expresses her concerns that Oriana was found by her father. After a brief contact with Miranda, where she expresses concern that her father is working with the Illusive Man, she asks Shepard to meet her on the Citadel, where she asks Shepard for access to Alliance resources, though she won't say why even if Shepard presses her. If Shepard refuses her access, she accepts Shepard's choice and leaves. If Shepard grants her access, she then confesses that when she had headed the Lazarus Project to revive Shepard, she wanted to put a control chip in Shepard's brain, to ensure Shepard wouldn't go rogue, but the Illusive Man, not wanting to take away who Shepard was, ordered her not to. Miranda admits that she was hypocritical in this since she had been doing everything she could to keep her father from controlling her life and Oriana's. Shepard can forgive her, saying that the main point is that she brought him/her back./nLater, Shepard finds Miranda in a Cerberus lab disguised as a refugee camp, Sanctuary, where her father had been running experiments on the refugees, as well as her father and Oriana. If Shepard is able to negotiate with Henry to let Oriana go, Miranda then kills him with a biotic attack. If Shepard is unable to negotiate, Miranda will still attack her father to save Oriana, and while she will kill him, he will fatally shoot her in the process. Miranda's fate also depends on if Shepard had warned her earlier on about the Cerberus assassin Kai Leng, who Miranda encounters on Sanctuary. If Shepard didn't warn her, or refused her access to Alliance resources, or didn't do her loyalty mission in Mass Effect 2, Miranda will die. She'll also die if she was romanced by a male Shepard in Mass Effect 2, but then breaks up with her in Mass Effect 3. If Shepard had completed Miranda's loyalty mission, as well as warned her of Kai Leng, Miranda survives and, after taking Oriana to safety, assists in the war effort./nLike other past and present surviving squad members, Miranda makes an appearance in the Mass Effect 3: Citadel downloadable content pack, which adds character moments which will vary in content depending on dialogue and event choices or whether Shepard is in a romance with her. Miranda is also available as a temporary squadmate in the Armax Arsenal Arena combat simulator./nMiranda first appeared in the iOS game Mass Effect Galaxy, released in 2009. In Galaxy, Miranda communicates with Jacob Taylor as a hologram and is his main informant on how to stop the batarian threat/nMiranda returns in the 2009 comic book series Mass Effect: Redemption, where she first encounters Liara T'Soni and Feron on Omega, offering to help them recover the lost Commander Shepard. After meeting Liara with the Illusive Man, she then takes Liara and Feron back to Omega, telling them that Shepard's body is still on the station and instructs them to recover it, with Cerberus reimbursing them for their efforts. Later, when the Shadow Broker's agent Tazzik makes off with Shepard's body to sell to the Collectors, Miranda asks the Illusive Man for permission to stop him, but the Illusive Man tells her to wait, saying that they need to find out why the Collectors are interested in Shepard. Miranda then notices Feron and Liara giving pursuit and asks to follow them, but the Illusive Man once again tells her to wait. At the end of the series, when Liara rescues Shepard's body and brings it to a Cerberus facility, Miranda tells Liara that she has doubts on whether or not Shepard can be revived, but assures her that if it's possible to bring Shepard back, Cerberus will do all they can./nMiranda is also a major supporting character in the Mass Effect: Foundation comic series, a prequel to the original Mass Effect trilogy and stars the main antagonist of the Mass Effect 3: Citadel DLC Maya Brooks as a point of view character./nMiranda received a mostly positive reception, and is a popular subject for fan art and cosplay.[11] BioWare revealed that Miranda's loyalty mission, which had a more \"a touchy-feely\" plot, was completed more than Grunt's on PC, but in the case of Xbox 360 players it was the opposite.[12] Strahovski was nominated for \"Best Performance by a Human Female\" in the Spike Video Game Awards.[13] Upon hearing news for a potential Mass Effect film, Dan Ryckert of Game Informer looked at the different characters and felt Strahovski should reprise the role, calling her the \"obvious choice\".[14] A reader's poll published by PC Gamer in 2015 revealed that Miranda is the second most popular love interest for Shepard after Liara T'Soni in the Mass Effect series.[15] In a 2016 article, PC Gamer ranked Miranda the eighth best companion of the Mass Effect series. On the character's story arc, PC Gamer staff member provided the following comments: \"Miranda's experience of genetic enhancements links back to her complicated relationship with her father, which is more closely and brutally examined in Mass Effect 3. This personal crisis makes her one of the series' more complex characters, in my opinion, offering some clear motivations for why she is the way she is\".[16]/nAttention was given to her looks. Complex listed her buttocks as one of the best in gaming, commenting \"Miranda is lethal, brilliant and looks just as hot running into battle as she does walking away from it\".[17] Complex also included her at number 40 in a list of the 50 hottest video game characters,[18] and included her as one of 25 \"best-looking sideline chicks in games\".[19] UGO.com similarly listed the character as the \"ninth-hottest fictional woman of 2012\", calling her a \"sultry brunette\".[20] MSN listed Miranda as one of the hottest women in video game history, commenting \"Genetically designed to be 'perfect', Miranda Lawson knows she's hot, intelligent, and is not afraid to tell anyone about it.\".[21]/nHowever, 1UP.com's Ryan Winterhalter called Miranda one of three areas where Mass Effect 2 was sexist, finding not fault with her concept as a genetically perfect woman, but mainly with the camera's focus on her buttocks.[22] Michael Graff from Screenrant was in agreement, ranking it one of the Mass Effect series' most cringe-inducing moments.[23] \nSoha Kareem, in her essay \"Mashing Our Buttons: On Romance And Sex In Video Games\" published in The Secret Loves of Geek Girls: Expanded Edition, criticized Miranda as a \"boring femme fatale type whose screen time includes opportunistic angles on her ass\" and who mistreats other female characters like Jack. She further alleged that the character is \"pretentious\", \"a product of wealth and masculine power structures\", and that Miranda \"would write the space version of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In.\"[24] Luke Plunkett from Kotaku criticized her romance subplot arc in Mass Effect 3, noting that \"The pathetic way in which the relationship, such a cornerstone of the second game, was given such short shrift was in hindsight a blessing\" in response to Miranda's change of characterization.[25] Evan Lahti from PC Gamer compared Miranda to furniture and commented, \"What do we remember about her, other than her skintight bodysuit and the way Mass Effect 2's camera suggestively frames her hips?\"[26]/nPaul Tamburro from Game Revolution commented that BioWare's decision to remove what he described as \"gratuitous butt shots\" for the 2021 Mass Effect: Legendary Edition compilation has prompted allegations of censorship from certain players.[27]", "38171178": "Philip Bruce White (29 December 1891 \u2013 19 March 1949) was a British microbiologist./nIn 1926, White published a schema for classifying salmonella bacteria based on serum.[2][3] This was later extended by the Danish microbiologist Fritz Kauffmann, the Kauffman\u2013White classification./nWhite became a fellow of the Royal Society on 20 March 1941.\nWhite died in London./n/nThis article about a biologist from the United Kingdom is a stub.

Changeux then left France for postdoctoral studies first at the University of California Berkeley (1965\u20131966) then at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York (1967). He returned to France as attach\u00e9 to the chair of Molecular Biology held by Jacques Monod. In 1972, he became director of the Unit of Molecular Neurobiology at the Pasteur Institute, where he received a professorship in 1975. In 1975, Changeux was elected professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, chair of Cell Communications, position that he held until 2006. Changeux is author of more than 600 scientific articles and several books, technical or for general audience./nAll his scientific career, Changeux has been faithful to a handful of scientific questions, at molecular, cellular and brain levels. If one needs to seek a unifying theme to all of them, it is the conviction that selection is the basis of life processes, rather than instruction. While started as separate lines of investigations, all the research threads were tied in the recent decades within the study of allosteric mechanisms as a basis of for the involvement of nicotinic receptors in cognitive functions./nDuring his PhD studies in the laboratory of Jacques Monod and Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, Changeux studied the allosteric regulations of enzymes, that is the modulation of their activity by compounds different from their substrates.[3][4][5] This work led to the development of the model of concerted transitions for allosteric proteins.[6][7] The main ideas behind this theory are: 1) proteins can exist under various conformations in thermal equilibrium in the absence of regulators. The allosteric regulators merely shift the equilibrium between the conformations, stabilizing the ones for which they display the highest affinity, and 2) all the subunits of a symmetrical multimeric protein exist in the same conformation, the transition taking place in a concerted fashion. The resulting model explains the observed cooperativity without a progressive change of biophysical parameters. This conceptual framework is still the principal model used to explain the function of cooperative proteins such as hemoglobin./nIn his PhD thesis, Changeux suggested that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptors[8] (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis Bray[9]). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle).[10][11] His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine.[12][13][14] The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain the shape of the post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin.[15] In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.[16]/nThe concept of an allosteric pharmacology[17] for ion channels was developed over the years. In addition to the well known GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (such as benzodiazepines and barbiturate drugs), one can find antiparasitic drug such as ivermectin[18] and glutamate receptor modulators used against Alzheimer's disease such as aniracetam./nIn 1970, Changeux isolated the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of the eel electric organ, the first ever isolated membrane pharmacological receptor,[20] that he was able to identify thanks to the properties of a snake toxin, which was purified by Taiwanese researchers CY Lee and CC Chang.[21] The isolation of the receptor was also later reported by Ricardo Miledi.[22] The improvements of purification methods developed in the group[23] allowed the proposition that the receptor was a pentameric protein,[24] a finding quickly confirmed by the team of Arthur Karlin.[25] The group of Changeux was among the firsts to elucidate the primary structure of the subunits of the receptor,[26][27] in parallel with the group of Shosaku Numa[28] and Stephen Heinemann.[29]/nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, molecular biology technics were used to decipher the tertiary and quaternary structures of the receptor. The location of the ionic pore was identified, made up of the second transmembrane segment,[30] as shown also later by the groups of Shosaku Numa[31] and Ferdinand Hucho.[32] The molecular basis of ionic selectivity were also identified in the transmembrane domain.[33][34][35] The structure of the binding site for the acetylcholine and nicotine was located at the interface between adjacent subunits.[36][37][38]/nThe quest of Changeux for the structure of the nicotinic receptor culminated with the publication of the structure, at atomic resolution, of a bacterial homolog in the open[39] and resting[40] conformations supporting the concept of a symmetrical concerted opening for channel gating,[41] in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.[42][43]/nIn 1973, together with Philippe Courr\u00e8ge and Antoine Danchin, Changeux proposed a model describing how, during development of the nervous system, the activity of a network could cause the stabilization or regression of the synapses involved[44] and illustrated it with the neuromuscular junction. This model is effectively the precursor of the \"neural Darwinism\" theory further promoted by Gerald Edelman. Changeux later extended and illustrated further this idea.[45] During the 1970s, he tried to document this phenomenon, either by studying mutant animals[46][47] or by experimental denervation.[48][49]/nWhile until the 1990s, Changeux's group studied the structure of the nicotinic receptor present in electric organs of electric eel and torpedo, the investigations of the physiological role of those receptors were mostly focussed on two model systems: the nicotinic receptors of the neuromuscular junction, the synapse linking the motorneuron to the skeletal muscle, and the nicotinic receptors of the brain, notably in relation with nicotine addiction./nFrom the mid-1980s, the group studied the compartimentalisation of the muscle cell upon development, as a model of synaptogenesis and in relation with the theoretical work on epigenesis. In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concomitant to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of gene transcription outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC,[50][51][52][53] and a stimulation of gene transcription at the synapse by the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) activating PKA[54][55][56] and the ARIA (heregulin) activating tyrosine kinase cascades.[57][58]/nThe 1990s saw the progressive shift of interest of Changeux from the neuromuscular junction to the nicotinic receptors expressed in the brain. Among the notable achievements of the group is the discovery that neuronal nicotinic receptors are highly permeable to calcium[59] \u2013 which explains the positive effect of nicotinic receptors on the release of many neurotransmitters in the brain.[60]/nThe group also discovered that the nicotinic receptor is regulated by a variety of \"allosteric modulators\" such as: 1. calcium ions[61] (This was also discovered independently by the group of John Dani[62]), which binding sites were later identified[19][63] and localized in the extracellular domain, at the interface between subunits (Le Nov\u00e8re et al. 2002); 2. ivermectin[18] which behaves as a potent positive allosteric modulator binding to a site present in the transmembrane domain (where general anesthetics also bind[64]); 3. phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain[65] which regulate desensitization./nBy the mid-1990s, Changeux concentrated most of his interest on the function of nicotinic receptors in the basal ganglia and in particular the mesencephalic dopaminergic system.  Using mice deleted for nicotinic receptor genes, the group characterised the types of receptor subunits present in the dopaminergic cells[66][67][68] and identified the receptors mainly responsible of the dependence to nicotine, formed by the subunits \u03b14, \u03b16 and \u03b22.[69][70]/nFrom the mid-1990s, Changeux developed an activity of computational modeling in order to investigate the neuronal bases of cognitive functions. This research was mainly performed in collaboration with Stanislas Dehaene, now leading the INSERM-CEA Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit. They notably modeled the acquisition of song recognition in birds[71] and the development of numerical abilities.[72] More recently, Dehaene and Changeux developed a neuronal model for access to consciousness based on a brain-wide recruitment of networks of neurons with long-range axons, referred to as the global neuronal workspace.[73][74] The model might have clinical applications for instance for understanding the mechanism of coma, the action of general anesthetics[75] or drug addiction[76]/nThe publication of his book Neuronal Man: The Biology of The Mind in 1985 brought Changeux celebrity status to the wider public. Since then, he authored or co-authored several other books inspired by his teaching at the College de France: notably, Conversations on Mind Matter and Mathematics with the mathematician Alain Connes (1998), What Makes Us Think with the philosopher Paul Ricoeur (2002) and the Physiology of truth (2002) that are acknowledged as having initiated an instructive dialogue between the two often-hostile disciplines of neuroscience and philosophy. He has also been concerned by the relationships between aesthetic experience and the brain in Raison & Plaisir (1994), The true the good the beautiful: a neurobiological approach (2012) and recently Les neurones enchant\u00e9s. (2014) where he debates the issue of artistic creation with the music composers Pierre Boulez and Philippe Manoury.  Changeux received the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science, Rockefeller University, New-York, 2005./nChangeux has also been the curator of three major exhibitions on Art and Science: De Nicolo dell'Abate \u00e0 Nicolas Poussin: aux sources du Classicisme 1550-1650 Mus\u00e9e Bossuet Meaux in 1988, L'\u00c2me au Corps, Arts et Sciences, 1793-1993 (with G\u00e9rard R\u00e9gnier) Galeries nationales du Grand Palais Paris in 1993-1994 and La lumi\u00e8re au si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res et aujourd'hui.

She did, however, spend time learning the violin purely for her love of music.[5]/nHer journey into education began at Slingerland District school, and then after spending nine years there, she went on to The Milne School in Albany, NY in which she graduated as valedictorian in 1905.[5] Between classes, she spent much of her free time exploring the outdoors, where she developed a love and curiosity for Lower Devonian rocks.[5] Following this, she enrolled in Wellesley College, a school for women, with an intended major in classical languages before developing a love for science.[4] She attained her Bachelors in 1909 and her Masters in 1912,  while also obtaining graduate work at Harvard University.[5] She finished her education at Johns Hopkins University, her school in 1921.[5]/nGoldring first began her career as a geology professor at her alma mater Wellesley College,[5] and as well obtained a position at Boston's Teacher's School of Science.[6] In 1912, Goldring went on to work for the New York state Museum as a Scientific Expert in Paleontology.[5] At the New York State Museum, she was hired to work as a scientific expert where she specialized in invertebrate paleontological exhibits and dioramas. From here, she successfully collected and organized data from an unfinished collaborative study on Devonian Crinoids.[9] In 1916, her boss at the New York State Museum requested her to continue work on a crinoid fossil study, which had been started but not completed by several other paleontologists before her.[10] She was required to finish identifying the different taxonomies of crinoid fossils. Not only was she able to complete this study in seven years, but out of the 25 families, 60 genera, and 155 species she recorded, she identified 2 new families, 18 new genera and 58 new species.[10] Based on this evidence Goldring concluded the stumps were a new genus she chose to name Eospermatoperis. Goldring published her findings in a monograph in 1923. This was so successful that other scientists and paleontologists sent her their own fossil samples for her to identify.[10]/nOn top of the Devonian Crinoids, Goldring also contributed many other dioramas to the New York State Museum. The Petrified Sea Gardens, the stromatolite site that she studied, is a National Natural Landmark and a National Historic Landmark of the United States. Her most famous diorama recreated the living fossil seed fern forest from the Devonian period in what is now Gilboa, New York.[8] This model truly solidified her reputation as an excellent paleontologist.[8]  This was possibly the first-ever diorama about early life anyone had created.[11] This acclaimed diorama was named the Gilboa Fossil Forest after where it was located, as well as what Goldring used to piece together the layout of this diorama.  In 1850 and 1920 in Gilboa, New York, petrified wood and fossilized rocks, respectively, were found[10] and in 1920, Goldring studied them and eventually identified them to be the fossils of seed ferns.[10]/nGoldring was an educator as well as a researcher, so while she devoted most of her life to the museum, she extensively utilized her knowledge to make the contents go beyond simply filling the museum by exploring ways to teach paleontology to the visitors. For example, Goldring's success with geological models and teaching displays progressed into her publishing many books on geology, some of these publications were even used for post secondary education purposes.[12] She created two geological models that were made to teach geological basics. They were titled \u201cWhat is a Fossil\u201d and \u201cWhat is a Geological Formation\u201d.[12]/nShe rarely conducted research abroad or traveled out of the state of New York, however, the one trip she had made was of great importance. In order to help Dr. John M. Clarke write his memoir on the areas of Gasp\u00e9 and Nova Scotia, Goldring traveled there to collect Devonian fossils.[5][13] Over the first 10 years of her career, she quickly proved her skills, earning different promotions including first Assistant Paleontologist, the Associate Paleontologist, Paleobotanist, and Assistant State Paleontologist.[8] Goldring eventually became the fourth State Paleontologist of New York, and the first woman to hold that position.[4] In 1949 she was elected president of the Paleontological Society (the largest association of paleontologists in the world), the first woman to hold that office and one of only three women to attain that position to this day.[4] Because these were (and still are) male-dominated geological societies, large numbers of men would not have supported her candidacy, underscoring her prominence as a nationally known geologist respected for the quality of her research, despite prevalent gender prejudices in academia. Winfred faced many equality issues such as unfair compensation and rare opportunities for advancement and in 1918 she briefly resigned over issues of inadequate salary combined with great pressures.[14][15]/nAfter forty years of commitment to the field, Goldring retired in 1954 and spent the next sixteen years at her family home in Slingerlands.[5]", "50262639": "Arunachala Sreenivasan (1909\u20131996) was an Indian food technologist, nutritional scientist and the director of Cancer Research Institute of the Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai.[1] Born on 13 July 1909 in Tamil Nadu and after receiving the degree of Doctor of Science from the University of Madras in 1936, he served in various positions such as Deputy Director of Central Food Technological Research Institute, (1959\u201364), Head of Biochemistry and Food Technology Division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, (1964\u201371), Adviser at the Department of Atomic Energy, and as the Emeritus Scientist of BARC (1971\u201373), before superannuating from Tata Memorial Centre in 1975.

His investigations of the dynamic self-organization of S-layers on growing and dividing cells and the assembly of isolated S-layer monomers in vitro have shown that S-layers are the simplest isopore protein membranes developed during evolution. These results were also the basis for the production of large S-layer ultrafiltration membranes with strictly defined separation (cut off) limits./nMajor fields of application were derived from the fact that S-layer proteins could be fused with other functional proteins (e.g. ligands, antigens, antibodies, enzymes, peptides) and assembled on solid carriers (e.g. metals, semiconductors, graphene, polymers) and lipid membranes including liposomes and emulsomes in the form of regular lattices. Due to their unique repetitive physicochemical properties, S-layers could be used in combination with other biomolecules (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, etc.) and nanoparticles as patterning elements and basic building blocks for the production of sometimes very complex supramolecular structures.

Ayala joins Voyager's crew as a security officer, serving under the command of Captain Kathryn Janeway with the provisional rank of lieutenant junior grade./nAyala serves in main engineering and at ops when Ensign Kim is not on duty, but later transfers to security. He is often seen on the bridge as a relief tactical officer when Tuvok leaves the bridge. Ayala later served as a relief helmsman when Tom Paris wasn't on duty./nIn \"Twisted\", Ayala is left in command of the bridge while the ship is affected by a distortion ring being and the senior staff is confined to the holodecks./nIn \"Shattered\", Chakotay encounters an alternate version of Ayala seven years younger who helps Chakotay and other time-tossed Voyager crew combat a threat posed by time-distorted Kazon invaders who hold engineering./nIn \"Repression\", Ayala is one of the Maquis who are temporarily brainwashed into taking control of the ship. He becomes one of Chakotay's personal guards./nAzan and Rebi are brothers, natives of the Wysanti race. Mezoti is a young Norcadian girl, born about 2368. All three were abducted and assimilated by the cybernetic aliens known as the Borg./nIn 2376, the Borg cube they were residing on as drones was disabled when all the adult drones on the vessel were killed by a pathogen that was carried on board by another abductee, Icheb. The Cube and the five surviving neonatal drones were abandoned by the Collective without their knowledge./nThe young drones encountered the USS Voyager and attempted to acquire technology that would help them re-establish their link with the Borg, but their efforts failed and they were brought aboard Voyager and carefully stripped of most of their cybernetic implants./nThey lived on Voyager for several months under the mentorship of Seven of Nine, a fellow ex-drone, where they began to receive an education. Then Voyager located the Wysanti and the brothers returned home in early 2377. As Captain Janeway had been unable to contact the Norcadians, Mezoti joined them and was eagerly welcomed by the Wysanti./nJoseph \"Joe\" Carey is a fictional recurring character in Star Trek: Voyager. He is a human Starfleet officer./nAn engineer aboard USS Voyager, Carey serves under B'Elanna Torres. In 2371, Carey is briefly named acting chief engineer when the original officer in that position is killed during the ship's violent passage to the Delta Quadrant, in which Voyager was flung over 70,000 light-years to the Delta Quadrant in the \"Caretaker\" episode, with Carey favored to be the replacement./nHowever, after some deliberation, Torres was made chief engineer in the \"Parallax\" episode by Captain Janeway, as Torres showed better abilities than Carey when the ship was trapped in a quantum singularity and took the lead in engineering. Carey congratulated her and promised to never betray her command, and thereafter serves as her assistant, despite there having initially been some friction between the two. He is disappointed with Janeway's decision but recognizes Torres' superior abilities./nIn 2377, Carey was assigned to join the away team to recover the remains of the Friendship One probe from the planet Uxal IV in the \"Friendship One\" episode. The away team discovered that the inhabitants of the planet had been irradiated by antimatter radiation caused by the probe. Unfortunately, Carey was murdered by a man named Verin, who had taken the away team hostage. At the time of his death, he had been working on a model of Voyager, which Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay finished./nChell is a fictional recurring character in Star Trek: Voyager. He is a Bolian. Chell is first introduced in the episode \"Learning Curve\", which is set in 2371./nChell, along with many other Voyager crewmen, originally served under Chakotay with the Maquis, until their ship was dragged to the Delta Quadrant by an entity known as the Caretaker. The ship was destroyed after Chakotay performed a suicide run on a Kazon ship. Transporters were used to avoid any casualties./nChell and the other Maquis were forced to merge with Voyager's crew on the long 70-year journey home to the Alpha Quadrant. Chell had disciplinary problems during the first year of Voyager's journey, such as talking out of turn. Chell ended up as a special group assigned to be trained Starfleet protocols by Tuvok, the ship's tactical officer. The others in the group included three other Maquis, Crewman Mariah Henley, Kenneth Dalby and Gerron, a Bajoran. At first Chell and the others were rude and disrespectful to Tuvok, but eventually improved under training. The group soon saved the ship from a plasma leak. Tuvok himself was saved from personal danger by the group, even though this violated orders./nIn 2377, Maquis were being physically attacked, though they soon recovered from their injuries. Chell loudly voices his thoughts indicating he had never become comfortable with Starfleet personnel. After Voyager's resident Talaxian, Neelix left the ship in 2378, Chell asked to take his place in the mess hall. Janeway reviewed his planned menu, which was full of food/ship puns. Chell's plans were cut short when Voyager soon returned home to the Alpha Quadrant./nChell's role as a character is expanded upon greatly when he appeared in the Activision game Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force as a member of the Hazard Team. He is also featured in the tie-in comic book released by Wildstorm Comics in 1999./nMark Bennington/n\"Your ocular implant. It's malfunctioning again.\"/nIcheb, \"Imperfection\"/nIcheb was played by Manu Intiraymi. He was assimilated by the Borg and has many parallels with the character Seven of Nine: they were both assimilated by the Borg while small children, were separated from the Borg hive mind, and restored close to their pre-Borg selves with the help of the crew of Voyager and Captain Janeway./nAfter Icheb was assimilated he was placed inside a Borg maturation chamber where he was to grow into an adult drone until an apparently space-borne virus infected the vessel he was aboard and consequently killed all the adult drones, disconnecting the vessel from the Borg. This caused the chamber to open and Icheb to emerge as an underdeveloped Borg drone./nHe was not the only neonatal drone aboard, and the other drones that emerged (Azan, Rebi and Mezoti, plus an unnamed 'First') from their maturation chambers formed their own small collective to run the ship and return to the Borg. At this point, in the episode \"Collective\", they encountered Voyager. First was dangerously unstable and was eventually killed in the cube's explosion while Captain Janeway persuaded the other children to abandon the Borg cube and join Voyager./nAs with Seven of Nine, the crew of Voyager restored the Borg children to their pre-Borg selves by removing most of their Borg implants and counseling them as they regained their normal personalities./nIn the episode \"Child's Play\", Icheb was facing a reunion with his parents. He met them, and at first was reluctant to return to the mainly agricultural planet, compared to the advanced technology and science of Voyager. Eventually, he warmed to his parents and elected to stay with them./nIt then emerged that the people of his homeworld had genetically engineered Icheb to be a weapon against the Borg using the genetic knowledge they had applied to agriculture. When assimilated, he introduced a biological virus into the collective; it was this virus that first disabled the Borg ship from which he and the other adolescent drones were recovered. His parents were planning to use him in this way again, to protect their homeworld, which frequently came under attack by the Borg. He was sedated by his parents, placed on a ship engineered to emit a false warp signature to attract the Borg, and sent toward a transwarp conduit frequently used by the Borg. Voyager retrieved Icheb before his ship was tractored into the Borg ship./nIcheb had many talents intellectually and fit in well with the crew of Voyager. His main position on Voyager was assisting Seven of Nine in the astrometrics laboratory. He sought to be admitted to the Starfleet Academy through training courses provided by the senior officers aboard Voyager. Partial communication was established with Starfleet Command on Earth, through which Icheb sat for and passed the entrance exam to the Academy. He gained the field rank of cadet from Captain Janeway.[2]/nThe episode \"Shattered\" featured an alternate timeline set in 2394 in which an adult Icheb (who had attained a field commission in Starfleet of Lieutenant Commander) helped Janeway and Chakotay restore Voyager to the correct space and time after it was hit by a \"chronokinetic surge\" that altered the ship. He did this by using advanced instruments that he and Naomi Wildman developed in the astrometrics lab./nIcheb's final appearance in Voyager's last episode features him beating Tuvok at Kal-toh the very first time he plays it. Since Icheb is exceptionally bright he may have a natural ability at the game \u2013 Icheb himself attributes the win to 'beginner's luck' \u2013 but this loss is the last in a series of inconsistencies that leads Tuvok to suspect he has a chronic Vulcan disease./nIcheb makes a cameo appearance in the Star Trek: Picard episode \"Stardust City Rag\".[1] Now a Lieutenant serving in Starfleet, Icheb is mortally wounded when his Borg components are harvested, while he is awake and not anesthetized. In agony and dying, Icheb begs Seven to kill him and end his suffering. Seven refers to him as \u201cmy child\u201d, then reluctantly complies./nThis scene, noted for its body horror element, also includes a tie into the Star Trek: Voyager episode \"Imperfection\", which involves Icheb donating the Borg portion of his eye to Seven of Nine; that history reveals the uselessness of the removal of his eye in \"Stardust City Rag\".[1]/nIntiraymi portrayed Icheb in the non-canon 2015 fan film Star Trek: Renegades.[3]/nMichael Jonas was played by Raphael Sbarge. A member of the Maquis crew that joined with Voyager's in the year 2371, he quickly lost faith in Captain Kathryn Janeway's ability to bring USS Voyager home safely. He was particularly affected by the death of Kurt Bendera, a popular member of the Maquis aspect of the crew./nHe began betraying secrets of Voyager to his former ally, Seska, a Cardassian spy among the Maquis, who had abandoned Voyager for a life aboard a Kazon Nistrim vessel. He sent the Kazon all that Voyager knew about breaking the Warp 10 barrier. He was killed in the second season of the show after a struggle with Neelix, who had been investigating who the traitor on Voyager was./nLon Suder, played by Brad Dourif, is an engineer on Voyager./nSuder is a sociopathic Betazoid mercenary, who, unlike most Betazoids, is disconnected from his own, and others', emotions. Many of the Maquis had been uncomfortable serving with Suder, who seemed to enjoy killing rather than having joined to further the Maquis cause. Suder later admits that this is exactly why he joined the Maquis: he likes to kill, and the Maquis provided a sufficient outlet for his rage./nWhile on Voyager, however, Suder cannot find an adequate release for his violent tendencies, and by the episode \"Meld\" he kills fellow crewman Frank Darwin in a murderous fury. Lieutenant Tuvok, refusing to accept Suder's explanation that he killed Darwin for no reason, mind melds with Suder in an attempt to discover the truth and to bestow upon the troubled crewman some of his own Vulcan self-discipline. However, the meld affects Tuvok, transmitting Suder's sociopathy to the Vulcan. Tuvok, mentally ill, ultimately tries to kill Suder, who does not fight back as he is prepared to die. Tuvok, partly helped by Suder's warnings that the violence will become his entire life, resists the temptation. The Doctor says this is a sign Tuvok is healing from his madness. Suder is sentenced to life imprisonment in his quarters until he can be rehabilitated. Over time, he finds that he has a natural talent for plant biology, and requests to help Voyager to both gain trust and become a part of the crew again./nWhen the Kazon and Cardassian spy Seska takes over Voyager in \"Basics\" and strands the crew on a desolate planet, only Suder and the ship's doctor are left on board. Struggling with his newfound inner peace and conscience, Suder is forced to revisit his violent ways to rescue his crewmates. He aids the Doctor in wresting control of the ship from the Kazon, at one point becoming nearly catatonic after being forced to kill. In a final, selfless act of sabotage, Suder kills a group of Kazon in the Engineering room and sabotages Voyager's backup phaser couplings just after he is fatally shot by a Kazon soldier. Because of his actions, Paris and some Talaxian comrades are able to retake Voyager. Tuvok later offers a Vulcan blessing over Suder's body that death might bring Suder the peace he could not find in life./nSeska first appears in the episode \"Parallax\" as a Bajoran crewmember absorbed from the Maquis ship in the episode \"Caretaker\". In the episode \"State of Flux\", she is revealed to be a Cardassian undercover agent, who had infiltrated the Maquis cell. During her time with the Maquis, Seska had a love affair with her commander, former Starfleet officer Chakotay and befriended the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres. Seska's former relationship with Chakotay would later prove key to her plan to capture Voyager in the double-episode story \"Basics\"./nOnce aboard Voyager, Seska slowly melded into a normal life with the mixed Starfleet\u2013Maquis crew, a process not without difficulty. After several clashes with the ship's rigid command structure and increasing frustration with the command of Captain Kathryn Janeway, Seska detached herself from the rest of the crew and began funneling assistance to the Kazon. She was caught while attempting to deliver replicator technology to the enemy and upon her apprehension, her true Cardassian identity was discovered by the Doctor. Seska fled to the Kazon whereupon Jal Culluh took her as a lover./nThe Kazon were able to capture Voyager with Seska's help after she joined their crew. Seska claimed to have impregnated herself with her former lover Chakotay's DNA and used the child as bait, knowing Chakotay would never abandon the child to the Kazon and its mother. The Kazon attacked the USS Voyager when it came for the child and were able to board and take over the vessel. During the short period when the Voyager crew was marooned on a planet, the Doctor learned that the child was half Cardassian and half Kazon and told Seska the child was Culluh's. The Doctor explained that despite the baby's somewhat human appearance the child would probably develop Kazon features later on./nSeska was killed when the Voyager crew retook the ship from the Kazon.[4] Culluh escaped, taking their son with him. Almost a year after her death, in the episode \"Worst Case Scenario\", a holodeck program she had altered to kill Tuvok, was discovered in the ship's memory and nearly accomplished its purpose before it was deactivated. Later, in \"Shattered,\" when Voyager was caught in a temporal rift that placed sections of the ship in different times, engineering was in the time period where the Kazon had captured the ship. Seska was featured in this episode as well and her control of the ship was stopped by a collaboration of crew members from various times./nIn 2015, SyFy rated Seska as among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of Star Trek.[5]/nIn 2018, CBR ranked Seska the 18th best recurring character of Star Trek shows.[6] They elaborate, \"Martha Hackett was fantastic in the part, showcasing Seska\u2019s transformation from supposedly loyal fighter to a scheming vixen.\"[6]/nIn 2020, The Digital Fix said that Seska was the standout character from season one, and that Hackett was a better actor than the main cast of the show in season one.[7]/nEnsign Vorik, played by Alexander Enberg, is a Vulcan male who serves aboard Voyager as an engineer./nEnsign Vorik was introduced in full as a minor character in the episode \"Fair Trade\". In the episode \"Blood Fever\", Vorik underwent his first pon farr on stardate 50537 while Voyager was stranded in the Delta Quadrant. Approximately 75,000 light years from his arranged mate, Vorik declared kun-ut so'lik with his superior officer, Lt. Torres. When she refused, Vorik became desperate and accidentally (and unknowingly) initiated a telepathic mating bond with her, which triggered her own Klingon mating instincts. Vorik was forced to search for alternative ways to resolve his pon farr, but he found no relief from meditation or a holographic mate. Eventually, having exhausted all of his options, Vorik made the challenge of combat in the ritual kun-ut kal-if-fee, for the right to mate with B'Elanna. An enraged B'Elanna took the challenge herself, defeating Vorik and curing them both of the pon farr. After they recovered, both Vorik and B'Elanna returned to normal duty./nIn the episode \"Counterpoint\", while Voyager crossed Devore space, Vorik was one of several telepathic crew members who were suspended in the transporter pattern buffer to avoid detection by the Devore inspections, led by Kashyk. Vorik's eighth, and last, appearance was the penultimate episode of the series, \"Renaissance Man\"./nStar Trek: Voyager producer and writer Jeri Taylor, Enberg's mother, has suggested that Vorik is the twin brother of Taurik, another Vulcan Starfleet engineer played by Enberg in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Lower Decks\".[8]/nIn the novel Homecoming Part 1 by Christie Golden, when Voyager gets back to Earth, Vorik was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade for his seven years of service on USS Voyager./nEnsign Samantha Wildman, played by actress Nancy Hower, joined Voyager as a xenobiologist, not knowing she was pregnant by her Ktarian husband Greskrendtregk. She gave birth to Naomi in 2372. She chose Neelix as Naomi's godfather./nThe character was named after a real person, a little girl who died in an accident. The real Samantha's organs were transplanted into the wife of Voyager episode writer Jimmy Diggs, who gratefully named a character after the girl.[9]", "53998202": "Norman Arnheim is an American biologist specializing in aging and development biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.

This was in the aftermath of the second Gulf War, when almost two million displaced Kurds fled to the borders with Iran and Turkey.  As a consequence, a \"no-fly zone, Safe Haven\" was established north of 36th parallel north that lasted from April 1991 until the fall of Saddam regime. The Safe Haven allowed the Kurds in Iraq to return to their homes, elect their own Kurdistan Regional Government and Kurdistan Parliament.

Sikorski named him to be in charge of Polish refugees and gave him a letter to take to President Roosevelt asking for US help; he also issued Rajchman a diplomatic passport which was what allowed him to flee France through Spain and Portugal and eventually reach Washington DC. During the second world war, Rajchman worked on humanitarian issues,[5] but also as adviser to TV Soong in development issues: indeed he was said to have belonged to the famous China Lobby. Towards the end of the war, UNRRA commissioned him to write a report on how to deal with the drastic state of health conditions once Europe would be freed, notably a typhus epidemic was feared. At the end of the war, the new communist Polish government in Lublin asked him to represent Poland within UNRRA. It is said that Rajchman had serious hesitations about collaborating with this government, but in the end he was won over by the desire to help his country which he did in fact very effectively through UNRRA./nWhen UNRRA announced at a UN meeting in Geneva that it would be putting an end to its relief efforts, Rajchman stood up before the assembly and called for the creation of a Fund dedicated to helping children throughout the world. His proposal was accepted and by the beginning of 1947, UNICEF was already helping children, notably with nutrition and immunization. Rajchman remained chairman of the board at UNICEF until 1950 and refused to be paid for his work./nIn the context of the nascent cold war and Stalinism in Soviet block countries, Rajchman was subpoenaed in the McCarthy period: he abruptly left for France and never returned to the United States. At the same time, the Polish communist authorities withdrew his Polish passport and he was not reissued one until 1956, when the post-Stalinist period began. From then on, Rajchman fairly often went to Poland, notably to visit his sister who had been dismissed by the authorities from her academic functions. His last visit was to Warsaw in 1963, to visit the public health institute he had founded in 1918./nRajchman was married to Marja Bojanczyk and died in Chenu, Sarthe in 1965 due to complications of Parkinson's disease.", "48460467": "Lise Thiry (born 5 February 1921) is a Belgian scientist and politician.

Since 2012 Krenn has been head of Studienprogramme in biology at the University of Vienna./nThe investigation of Krenn and co-workers contributed to reveal the form and functional mechanism of insect mouthparts relationships.[1][2][3] The study of insect mouthparts was helpful for the understanding of the functional mechanism of the proboscis of butterflies (Lepidoptera) to elucidate the evolution of new forms and functions.[4][5] The study of the proboscis of butterflies revealed surprising examples of adaptations to different kinds of fluid food, for example nectar, plant sap, tree sap, dung)[3][6][7] and of adaptations to the use of pollen as complementary food in butterflies of the Neotropical genus Heliconius.[8][9] An extremely-long proboscis appears within multiple groups of flower visiting insects but is relatively rare. Current studies represent the first attempt to evaluate the costs and benefits of these long sucking organs taking into consideration sucking and pumping organs of different insects. In a group of Lepidoptera, novel mouthpart organs were analysed in detail, not homologous to related raxa.[10] A novel mouth part organ evolved in the female yucca moth and serves for the pollination of the larval host plant./nKrenn's research activity combines experimental field work, for example at the tropical Field Station La Gamba, Costa Rica, with morphological and experimental studies at the University of Vienna./nSelected papers:", "46199491": "Anna Cherrie Epps (July 8, 1930 \u2013 May 18, 2017) was an American microbiologist known for her immunology research as well as her efforts to promote the advancement of minorities within the sciences, specifically medicine./nIn 1930, Epps was born in New Orleans to Ernest Cherrie Sr., a physician, and Anna Cherrie, a former schoolteacher.

Epps started studying at Howard University when she was 16.[1] In 1951, at age 19, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology. Following her goal to become a physician, she applied to medical school at Howard University as well as Meharry Medical College. Epps was denied admission to both, however, attributed to her young age and gender.[1] From 1954 to 1960, she worked as an instructor and the acting head of the medical technology department at Xavier University. In 1959, Epps earned her master's degree from Loyola University in microbiology.[2] In 1966, Epps earned her doctoral degree in zoology from Howard University College of Medicine./nEpps' early research at Howard focused on immunology, specifically the study of tropical and infectious diseases.[3] Epps' research at Johns Hopkins, for which she was awarded a U.S. Public Health Service Faculty Research Fellowship, investigated immunology related to liver disease,[4] stomach cancer,[5] and alpha-1-fetoprotein.[6]/nIn 1993, Epps was commissioned by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences to write \"Increasing Minority Participation in the Health Professions\u2014The Problem of Under-representation and An Inventory and Analysis of Effective Strategies and Problems.\"[3]/nIn addition to publishing journal articles and scientific reviews, Epps co-authored \"An Act of Grade: The Right Side of History\", a book detailing the history of Meharry Medical College over 133 years of its development.[7][8]/nStarting in 1953, Epps first worked as a technologist in the clinical laboratories of Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in Cincinnati and Flint Goodridge Hospital in New Orleans.

Goodman was a distinguished professor at the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics at Wayne State University School of Medicine, editor-in-chief of the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, and a member of the anthropology section of the United States National Academy of Sciences./nGoodman grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and spent many years in Detroit, Michigan as the only Wayne State University faculty member appointed to the National Academy of Science until his death on November 14, 2010. After high school, he attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for one year, then in 1943 entered the Army Air Forces, where he served as a navigator for the remainder of World War II. He was married in 1946, shortly after returning to college. He became interested in science after a comparative anatomy course; the professor, Harold Wolfe, recruited him as a teaching assistant. Goodman graduated with a degree in zoology and a minor in biochemistry, and continued on at Wisconsin for his master's and Ph.D. degrees under Wolfe (a former student of Alan Boyden). Upon finishing a dissertation on the antigen-antibody precipitin reaction, he went to Caltech for post-doctoral work, supported by an NIH fellowship.[2]/nWorking with Dan Campbell at Caltech (within the Division of Chemistry headed by Linus Pauling), Goodman worked on the immunological properties of hemoglobins, including the immunological differences between normal and sickle-cell hemoglobin.  According to a 2004 interview, Goodman became interested in evolutionary problems around 1957\u20131958.  After research stints at the University of Illinois Medical School and the Detroit Institute of Cancer Research, he embarked\u2014with his friend Morris Wilson\u2014on studies of the degree of variability in proteins expressed early vs. late in development.[2]/nBy 1961, Goodman's comparative immunology research produced some results, particularly on the evolutionary relationships among primates, that were attracting interest from evolutionary biologists.  He presented his ideas at the New York Academy of Sciences and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.  At the latter meeting, he and two others using molecular approaches to evolutionary problems (Emile Zuckerkandl and Harold Klinger) were confronted by three of the \"framers\" of the modern evolutionary synthesis: Ernst Mayr, G. G. Simpson, and Theodosius Dobzhansky.  During the early history of molecular evolution, traditional evolutionists were both interested in and apprehensive about the advent of molecular techniques to evolutionary biology; Simpson later referred to Goodman as \"an old friendly antagonist.\".[2]/nThrough the 1960s and 1970s, Goodman continued his evolutionary work based on serology, eventually with graduate students working under him.  In the 1970s he also started using protein sequence data for his molecular taxonomy work.  In a 1975 paper in Nature,[3] Goodman and his collaborators used sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hemoglobin (including possible ancestral sequences) and analyze which sites on the hemoglobin complex had evolved at which stages.  Goodman called this the first \"hard evidence of Darwinian evolution\".  In 1982, with another Nature paper,[4] Goodman did the same for the DNA sequences of the hemoglobin genes.[2]", "55341779": "Oscar Paulino Arredondo de la Mata (18 July 1918 \u2013 20 July 2001) was a Cuban paleontologist.
