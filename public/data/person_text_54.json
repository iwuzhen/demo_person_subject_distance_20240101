In 1904 with Austro-Hungarian Franjo Hanaman he was the first to develop and patent an incandescent light bulb with a tungsten filament, made by extruding a paste of tungsten powder and a carbonaceous binder to produce a fine thread, then removing the carbon by heating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and water vapors.[3]  Just and Hanaman received a Hungarian patent in 1904, and later US Patent 1,018,502.[1] In 1905, Just and Hanaman patented a process for producing tungsten filaments by plating carbon filaments with tungsten, then removing the carbon by heating.[4] These early tungsten lamps were more efficient than a carbon filament lamp, because they could operate at a high temperature, due to the high melting point of tungsten. The tungsten was, however, so brittle that these lamps were of limited practical use.[5] It was supplanted by the drawn tungsten filament lamp, developed in 1910 by William David Coolidge.", "56984536": "Martha J.
